 Bill,  Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.  Craig Dean 
 Hey Paul.  Just thought I write and see if you found out more about the snowboard, and if you are sure that you do not want anything for it?   I really appreciate it,  Geir 
 GOOD ARTICLE 
 I HAVE SOME POWER WHAT IS YOUR BID? 
 THERE WERE SOME ISO CUTS AND ISSUES YESTERDAY:  HE19: EPMI_CISO_DUCKS @MALIN. CUT THE SCHEDULE FROM 219MW TO 169MW.  HE23: FLOWED 75MW FROM MALIN TO PALO VERDE. THERE ARE NO FINALS FOR THIS SCHEDULE. THE REASON WAS THAT WE WERE FIRST AWARDED 75MW CONG RELIEF. THEY THEN REPOSTED FINALS WITHOUT TELLING US. WE FOUND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUR THAT THE 75MW SHOULD NOT BE IN THERE. INSTEAD OF CUTTING THE SCHEDULE AND PISSING OFF EVERYBODY I HAD BARRY AT THE ISO PUT IN THE SCHEDULE. WE ARE NOT GETTING CONG RELIEF BUT THE SCHEDULE DID FLOW.  GEIR 
 I WILL PICK 24.25 
 I am sorry that I did not get the certificate to you. I know you said it was urgent but I you did not tell me that yoy were going to England and needed it this week. The number is: 503-731-4354 I can pick it up on monday. Tell me if you want me to  I am sorry mum Geir

 Please give me a call when you would like to meet. I will be available the rest of the week (503) 772-0515  Geir 
 Roger called to inform us that they will be doing a 5MW payback HE7 on.  It will come in the scrape as a firm schedule and there will be no schedule in the model.  Check tags EPE1152 and EPE1153 for more information.  Thanks, -John Anderson 
  For Monday -  STNW is 35 mw short off peak @ Mid-Columbia.  Please cover these positions under the STWHOURLY book and enter an inter-desk swap with STNW to reconcile. Contact Bill, Sean, or me if you have any questions whatsoever about how to handle this.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey..  The ISO forced balanced our PORTFOLIO for SUNDAY. They shifted EES load from SP15 to NP15 with Congestion and paid a lot of Congestion in the process. The Amounts are in The PGE3 LOAD zone under EES2. The amounts are as following.  HE8	8 HE10 	5 HE14	46 HE15	40 HE16	40 HE17	44 HE18	40 HE19	24  Could you please make sure to charge EES with the congestion charges and not RT.  Thanks. Geir 
 HEY KATE. COULD YOU PLEASE INCLUDE THE PRICES IN THESE EMAILS.  GEIR

 Hey Cara  BPA called me yesterday inquiring about tag 26486. They did not think the PSE was right from BIGEDDY/NOB. It says BPA, they claim it is ENRON. They told me to notify my pre-scheduleder on Monday so this could be straightened out.  Geir

 Hey Guys.  The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels.  Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.  Geir 
 Hey Guys!  I went through all the templates and removed the RT prefix for all the templates. You can now sort them alphabetically making the process of finding the right template a lot easier. From now on please do no use the RT prefix when creating new templates.  Geir 
 I HAD TO BUY THE TRANSMISSION FROM PAC TO BC BORDER TO MAKE SURE THE SCHEDULE FLOWED. THE DEAL# IS 650664. PLEASE FIGURE OUT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR THIS WHEEL AND BILL THEM.  GEIR

 The following tags were replaced: 23707 is 23720 LATE/DENIED AGAIN THEN 23728 WHICH I CANCELLED 23706 is 23721 LATE/DENIED AGAIN THEN 23725 WHICH I CANCELLED 23711 is 23722 LATE/DENIED AGAIN THEN 23725 WHICH I CANCELLED 23713 is 23718 APPROVED  I had everybody put in the schedules even though the  They did not all get implemented due to PAC not seing the new tags on their machine, but they saw the the old ones and confirmed that the schedules were in. I issued RT TAGS for the three that got denied the second time. I guess this was the wrong thing to do as PAC went crazy and started yelling at me saying that I was creating duplicates, so I withdrew them again.  I talked to RAY/PAC STEVE/WALC PISSED OFF WOMAN/NEVP.

 Hey Guys.  We have a new way to export from NP15 up to the Northwest. Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.  The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm.  On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO.   Procedure: Export at Cascade from the CISO. Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System.  Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.  I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.  Geir 
 WE CUT THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULES RT. HE 13 EPMI_CISO_SPP 40 MW EXPORT AT SUMMIT. ALSO EPMI_CISO_TOBY FOR THE SAME HOUR GOT CUT FROM 25 TO O AT NOB.  I COULD NOT FIND THE VOLUME MGMT EMAIL ADDRESS SO I AM ONLY SENDING IT TO YOU.  GEIR

  NEED TOUR PICK BEFORE THE NEXT ROUND STARTS 
 Hey Guys.  I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA.  The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour.  IN CAPS: We sell to NCPA in ZP26. We buy from NCPA in NP15.  We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL). PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.    NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520 PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969  If you guys have any questions  just ask me.  Geir 
 HEY GUYS!  We got some supplemental bids awarded Friday and Saturday monring and as you know CAPS does not deal very well with sup's.  FRIDAY: EPMI_CISO_MEAD  HE3: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230, HE4: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230.  STAURDAY: EPMI_CISO_MEAD  HE2: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230, HE3: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230, HE4: -75 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230. HE5: -100 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230.  EPMI_CISO_SOUTH  HE3: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT PALO VERDE.  I HAVE ENTERED THE DEALS IN CAPS BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR AS AWARDED AS IT DOES NOT WORK.  GEIR 
 The ISO cut the one side of my wheel on HE24 on 4/13.  I had a firm export at 4C (EPMI_CISO_BUNNY)  of 20 mw for a sale to powerex and a wheel EPMI_CISO_ TOBY at PALO going out at Silverpeak. They cut the sale to POWEREX and the following imports. They cut the following:  EPMI_CISO_BUNNY 20 to a 8 EPMI_CISO_TOBY IMPORT 12 to 4.  All this while keeping my EPMI_CISO_TOBY Export at a 12.  Basically they used both the WHEEL IMPORT/ FIRM IMPORT to Fill the WHEEL EXPORT.  Geir 
 Hey Guys.  We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).  - Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC). - Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak) - Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84) - Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).  We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin.  THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.    Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can. If you have any questions over the weekend call me.  Account numbers: SPP - PAC: 853724 SPP-SNOHO: 853703 SPP-PUGET: 853725   Geir
