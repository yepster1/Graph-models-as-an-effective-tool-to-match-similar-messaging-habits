 Thanks for rounding up the tickets for the Orange Bowl.  You can mail them to me, or just hold them until I see you after Christmas.  Mike's wife decided not to make the trip, so he won't be using the tickets.  Jody Crook will use the other two tickets.  Lunch during the week between Christmas and New Years sounds great to me.  I will be working that week, but would be glad to meet you guys at Champions for lunch if that is best.  Or if you are game for Irma's, just let me know when you would like to come downtown.  --Sally 
 Did Debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo?  Is she raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?  Just curious, before I send any type of response.  I would need details from you around the process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.  Surely one feeds the other?  --Sally 
 I have attended three ASE's and would be happy to visit with you about my opinions.  I will ask Patti to schedule a meeting.  --Sally 
 Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:  review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same day,  to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe)  discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to continually improve the process),  discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR  do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE  discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London  discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of  mid and back office services   In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan to meet with Fernley as well.  Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday. 
 Please see following details for Friday's brainstorming session:  Date: Friday, January 12, 2001 Time: 8:30 - 2:00 PM (Continental breakfast & lunch will be served) Place: Four Seasons Hotel 1300 Lamar St. "Highland" Room (to the right, upstairs to 2nd floor, then left) Parking: Stamp will be provided in meeting room to validate parking tickets  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas cards.  I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the major goals for the trip are:  to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same  day,  to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),  to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year,  to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR  I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like for me to meet.  Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy. Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this week.  I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally 
 This one is pretty funny... 
 The other place in San Antonio is Westin's La Canterra.  I will contact both and get info.  Then we should make reservations soon.  I'll call Cindy tonight and fill her in.  -Sally 
 I plan to work out of the London office during the week of January 15.  I will leave Houston on Sunday and will be in the London office starting around noon on Monday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Monday, January 22. The primary goals of the trip are:  to work with Mike Jordan on an action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same  day,  to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 per my e:mail to you for managers and above within Operations),  to hold a training session for business controllers in the London office who will participate in Doorstep   reviews this year (outside EEL),  to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR  Patti Thompson (x39106) will have a detailed itinerary in hand if you need to reach me at any time next week. 
 I love it!!  I think that is perfect.  Much easier for my family and probably for everyone else.  That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, assuming that works for everyone.  Removing some of the travel hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time, too.  Hyatt Hill Country is one obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.  There is a newer resort in the area also.  I can't think of the name of it offhand, but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you. --Sally 
 Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another spot besides 47 Park?  I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally 
 I will attend the meeting on Thursday, but will have to leave around 1:15 to make it to a meeting at the Doubletree where I am speaking at 1:30.  Thanks. 
 Jeff, thanks for taking care of this for Fred. --Sally 
 Lexi:  In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with this disposition:  Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the career center?) and no to Ryan.  I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please see following details for Thursday's operational risk meeting:  Date: Thursday, January 11, 2001 Time: 1:00 - 4:00 PM Place: Hyatt Regency Hotel "Regency" Room (up escalators to 2nd floor, next to gift shop) Subject: Operational Risk Attendees: All Energy Operations Managers and above (ENA, EIM, EGM)  Please note: If you are unable to attend for any reason, please contact Sally at ext. 35926.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please make every effort to attend this meeting as it relates to the work you will be doing with bonuses this week.  Date:  Today - Tuesday, January 9, 2001 Time: 1:30 - 2:30 PM Place: EB 30C1 Subject: Results from Market Compensation Study by Todd Burke Attendees: Sally & Brent's Direct Reports (Operations only) + HR  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I knew that you would still be in London.  Just thought that I would start to copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's going on.  Yes, I will be in London next week.  Plan to fly over on Sunday night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.  I will be there through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.  Let's definitely plan to get together.  I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my schedule for next week.  I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when we can get together.  Looking forward to it.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  Meagan called this afternoon to tell me the news.  I will perhaps get more details when I get home tonight.  I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.  Let us know what we can do to help.  I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.  We will be anxious to meet our newest neighbor.  --Sally 
 I will be out of town on January 19, so Brenda Herod has agreed to make the presentation for Rick Causey.  Please replace my name with hers for all communication regarding this Analyst Orientation.  Thanks. 
 Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the location for the meeting will be sent to you early this week.  I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that will keep you from attending the meeting. 
 Great - I will add her name to the distribution list so that she will get our upcoming note on the location for this meeting.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.  So it is gone - but not sent!!  Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology. 
 I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.  I have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him. The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school. I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to Austin early.  Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early.  I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased. (Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you.  Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that. Let me know.  --Sally 
 Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.  Congratulations on the baby!  I hope that you are feeling well.  I am so happy for you and your husband.  My how your lives will change!!  But how enriched they will be. Our three are so much fun.  I will also always be honest with expectant moms and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.   If you ever want some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me know.  I would be glad to share my experience with you.  --Sally 
 I did not see an attachment to this memo from MP.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 I will ask Patti to set up a meeting for us this week.  Your name has been on my list to call - a trip to the Orange Bowl last week cut my week short, so I will look forward to getting with you this week.  --Sally 
 I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.  It is always great to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front of you.  No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after graduation.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about your offer while you are going through that process.  Enron had a fantastic year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  We hope that you will be a part of that.  My number at work is 713-853-5926.  Please feel free to call me any time.  If it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, my home number is 281-370-8568.  Don't hesitate to call.  Sally Beck sally.beck@enron.com 
 I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!  My husband (an OU grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and see the team absolutely stop FSU.  If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are on vacation, please give me a call.  2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  I hope that you will join us and be a part of that.  My office number is 713-853-5926.  If it is more convenient for you, feel free to call me at home as well.  That number is 281-370-8568.  Boomer Sooners!!!  Sally Beck sally.beck@enron.com

 I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  I did not know that he had passed away.  I know that he has been very ill.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  I know that it must hard to say goodbye to someone that has been such a part of your life for so long.  We will miss you on the 11th, but certainly understand your absence.  --Sally 
 Absolutely - Clara should have been included.  I asked for a list of managers and above within EGM from Chantelle, and used that for the distribution list.  Her list omitted Clara.  All lists that I requested from EGM, ENA and EIM were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of our year-end PRC process.  I don't think that I got consistent info from everyone, so I am rechecking names right now and will send Clara a message about the meeting as I also clean up any others that were left off of lists. Thanks for catching this.  --Sally 
 Please print this for me in color ASAP.  I need to review it today and get back to Louise.  Thanks. 
 I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.  The purpose of this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.  I know that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or are currently providing services to outside parties.  While there are efforts underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office services.  I hope that you will be able to attend.  Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you on Monday when Patti returns from vacation. 
 I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.  I bought a book at Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc. These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well.  I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if there is any place that we could get excited about going. 
 I have a standing staff meeting that I attend on Monday mornings, so I will not be available when you and James meet on the 8th.  I will look forward to getting with James after your meeting for an update. 
 I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up. Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete. Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very useful.  I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and I will follow through on that if you would like.  Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good one for you.  --Sally 
 I will be there at 8:40 on Monday -- not a word until then... 
 I have been out of the office at the Orange Bowl game and have just returned within the last hour.  That probably would make next week better for me than this week.  Give me a call and we will set something up.  My number is x35926.  If you don't reach me, call my temp assistant (Camella - x39106) and she will be able to set  up a meeting.  Thanks. 
 I will be out of the office on Wednesday, January 3.  I am married to an OU graduate, so we are headed to the Orange Bowl to hopefully see Oklahoma hang onto their number 1 ranking.  I will be back in the office after lunch on Thursday, January 4.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has phone numbers where I can be reached.  Please contact Bob Hall at x36956 with any questions while I am out. 
 We will also have both of our cell phones with us:  David  713-299-1436 Sally    713-417-1591  We will hope for a little warmer weather in Fort Lauderdale!!  The game is on Wednesday evening - we will do some sightseeing during the day on Wednesday. I will be back in the office on Thursday afternoon.  Love, Sally 
 Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another delivered.  Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze. --Sally 
 I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to busts.  I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.  Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your efforts.  --Sally 
 I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP. Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally 
 I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed working as long as I could.  Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while afterwards!! 
 I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up.  I sent the note below to Kim.  I am sure that she manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization.   It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed.  That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task.  Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one that gets the phone calls.  The ENA organization must develop confidence in others on our team.  Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs.   Thanks. 
 Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner? As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get his caught up.  Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle for the RMT Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to Stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date? --Sally   Kim S Theriot                12/27/2000 05:51 PM 
 Thanks for letting me know.  I am sure that you have communicated with the Portland risk group regarding this slip up.  What assurances have you gotten from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books?  Do you think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is? --Sally 
 I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews for the first quarter.  As long as the New York review isn't the week of January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip. Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me  - I know that you are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical things that you need to handle.  I will try to send you a list of topics that I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting point.  You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while I am there.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Stephanie,  Sally would like to renew this subscription.  I'm sorry I did not respond earlier.  Her co. # is 0413 & CC # 105588. Please let me know if you require additional information.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106    Enron North America Corp. 
 Can you put a referenced as of date on the spreadsheet itself?  If you print the spreadsheet for reference after receiving the e:mail, there is no as of date that appears on the print out of the spreadsheet.  Your attachment includes the date as the name of the file, but this does not appear when you simply print our the attached spreadsheet.  Thanks.  --Sally Beck 
 The items noted look like a good start to earlier detection of issues that may require reruns of valuation.  Thanks for marshalling the right resources to make this happen.  I will look forward to seeing your process timelines for current, iterim and target final state.  If my trip to London in mid-January works for your schedule, maybe this is something that we could go over then.  --Sally 
 To continue to keep you in the loop - looks like Mike is moving in the right direction on this --Sally 
 Please use my office for the interviews on November 4th.  My office is EB3389.  If you need additional offices, you could contact several of my direct reports who have offices:  Brent Price, Brenda Herod, Bob Hall, Mary Solmonson and James Scribner.  --Sally 
 Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus information.)  I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally 
 You should see this reply from Mike -- it is more positive than the response from James New.  Sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes, systems, commercial practices, etc. to move to a same day calculation of their books.  Mike and I have talked about this as a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.  I expect to review that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion. That is why you haven't yet seen the document.  --Sally 
 I should have included you on this contact list.  I will remember to do so next time.  I will be in the office all of this week, so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week. 
 Good memo on contacts.  Thanks for copying me.  Have a wonderful vacation. I know that you will be glad to have Jordan back with you.  --Sally 
 Unfortunately, I will miss your farewell at Slick Willie's on January 3rd.  I am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to London.  I will be in Miami on January 3rd, hopefully celebrating an Oklahoma win in the Orange Bowl earlier that day.  David found us tickets to the game.  Not great seats, but they are in the stadium.  Hey, it's not UT, but it should still be fun to go.  I will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in Houston.  But I know that I can count on you to be just as vocal from London!  I plan to be there at least quarterly in 2001, and will definitely welcome your first hand observations on operational areas that may need attention.  Hopefully between e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch.  Tell Ann that I hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the whole family.  I think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives to give them this experience.    Have fun -- and set them straight!! 
 Thanks for including me in the invitation to Slick Willie's.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend.  I will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami and will not return until the morning of the 4th. 
 We are making some progress with the timeliness of London information.  More to come... 
 Laurel,  Sally's plans are to be in the office Jan 2 & 5 only.  She will be out of town Jan 3 & 4.  Patti x39106 
 Tammie,  Sally is on vacation this week, therefore she will not be attending staff meeting.  She will be back in the office 12/27.  Patti x39106 
 The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.  Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your best estimate of trading results.  Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information for the worldwide trading organization.  I hope that all of you enjoy your holidays.

 Got your most recent message.  Your observation is correct that the Enron Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to date to expose her to Doorstep.  After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project. 
 I understand from Shona that you and she have discussed our plans for Doorstep Reviews in 2001.  I am asking via this note for my assistant to set up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline, methodology, Andersen's involvement and the involvement of your team.  I will be on vacation the week of December 18.  I will be working the week between Christmas and New Year's, so if you are in the office we can plan on getting together that week. 
 I will be out of the office on vacation during the week of December 18. Please refer to the contact names below as needed during that week.  I can be reached at my home number (281-370-8568) if necessary.  DPR     Chris Abel   x33102  MPR     David Maxwell  x36983  Gas Operations   Bob Hall   x36956 Leslie Reeves  x37962 Jeff Gossett   x37306  Power Operations  Stacey White  x31870 Leslie Reeves  x37962  Canadian Operations  Peggy Hedstrom  403-974-6753  I will be back in the office on Wednesday, December 27 through Friday, December 29.  I will also be in for part of the day on Tuesday, December 26. Although that is an Enron holiday, there will be appropriate logistics personnel and book administrators in the office to support trading activities that day. 
 Patti will send you on Monday a draft of a memo regarding publishing the DPR during the holidays.  Please review it and make sure that the commitments we are making can be met by London.  Let me know if anything needs to be changed or if there is further clarification needed in the notes, keeping in mind that with the audience on the memo that I want it to be short and easy.  Your comments/suggestions are welcomed and needed before I send this out later next week.  Thanks. --sally 
 Great to hear from you.  I was thinking about you today.  I will look forward to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working together.  I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally 
 The Analyst/Associates Program plans to send the PRC reps a final listing of the PRC results by Tuesday, December 19th.  They asked that we not communicate results until after that date.  I did not write down all results from the meeting, so I would be glad to let you know, but would prefer to wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me before doing so.  Both Remi and Don Black were able to add to my discussion around Erwin, so he was well respresented in the process.  I am scheduled to be out on vacation next week, but I will check e:mail messages from home and will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results. Hope that you enjoy the holidays.  I will be back at work right after Christmas.  -Sally 
 FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi below. 
 Sally,  Please let Cynthia know that Sally is out of town recruiting today.  I did speak to someone in her office (I thought it was her assistant) and Bobbie Power a week or two ago to let them know that Sally would not be available on this date.  Sally does, however, want to be a part of this group, so please notify us for the next meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally's assistant) 
 I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting started.  I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office dedication, so I did not call!  Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday. My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the week between Christmas and New Years.  I wouldn't recommend taking your time during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.  Wish I could send you with a shopping list for me!! 
 Thanks for the heads up.  I will be here all day tomorrow.  --Sally 
 I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.  Since it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a good decision.  I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for the family next week that I can use it. 
 I left Mike a message telling him that I was forwarding this to you and that someone on your team would verify this information and get  back to him.  His note asks for info back by Friday the 17th - Friday is the 15th and I assume that is the deadline that he intends.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Cathy, I plan to be on vacation next week and therefore will not be at the December 18th staff meeting. 
 Thanks for looking into this and getting back to me.  Let me know the final resolution on this one. 
 I meant to blind copy you on this.  Here it is... 
 The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 I will interviewing on campus for the Analyst Program on Monday and Tuesday, October 30 and 31.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I can be reached.  I will have my cell phone with me (713-417-1591) and I will check messages as we have breaks in the interview schedule during the day.   I will be back in the office on Wednesday, November 1.  In my absence, please contact the following persons regarding trading operations issues:  Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306 Bob Hall  x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962  Power Operations Stacey White x31870 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Shona Wilson x39123  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 Yes, you are nuts!  I can't believe that you already have so many gingerbread houses made.  The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely the easy route on that one.  I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow. -Sally 
 I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest (global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am copying them on this memo.  When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet macros. 
 Thanks for your note.  I was great to meet you - I am glad that you could take the time out of the office to make the trip to Houston.  I will look forward to seeing you when I am next in London.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. (Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road until Brenda returns.  Let me know.  I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true. If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry. Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you have heard anything on this. 
 You got the right one -- thanks for telling me, but I already knew that without your having to tell me.  I cherish having sisters and love you very much too.  (Okay, maybe one of you is more cherished than the other, but don't tell Cara I said that!) 
 Cary, thanks for the response.  We will keep your name on the list and will contact you for any spring events.  --Sally 
 We can't wait to see the three of you.  Tammy and Tyler will be at home on Wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you.  Meagan has drill team practice after school until 4:45 and she drives herself home and Amanda rides the bus home after school, arriving about 4:30.  Mo will be in Houston while you are here.  If it still works with your plans, I thought that I would take the day off on Friday, November 3 so that you, Paul, David and I could do something fun with Rebecca and Tyler.  The football game is that evening at 7:00.  I had also thought about arranging a lunch on Thursday (downtown - Irma's?) either for us with Mo, or even to expand that to include a bunch of ex-First City folks.  Mark Wilson, James Scribner, Chuch Randall and Charles Delacey all work here for Enron.  We could call MG Shetty, and with you and Mo and me, it would be quite a reunion.  Let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things and I will arrange whatever sounds good to you.  Our phone numbers are: Home  281-370-8568 Sally's Office   713-853-5926 David's Cell:  713-299-1436 Sally's Cell:    713-417-1591 
 Thanks for the note.  I remembered that you will be coming in from London. Hope the trip is uneventful.  Sunday evening will not be lengthy, as I am sure that you will be tired. 
 I hope that you have fun (are marathon and fun mutally exclusive terms?!). We will see you on Monday.  --Sally 
 I would like to formulate the breakout groups prior to the forum.  I would like your input on likely persons to put together in these breakout sessions.  Let's talk tomorrow. 
 I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs for Energy Operations in ENA.   Frank is working on a contract basis at this time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.  I have given Sheila my feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank than I have had.  Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with Frank.  Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.   Thanks for taking the time to do this. 
 Very belated reply - I am cleaning up old e:mails today, and came across this one that I had not answered.  Commercial does not sign confirmations at this point.  Too many to make that practical these days.  When I started the confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing confirms at that time. Once they knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me.  In the early days of power, the traders once again were signing confirms.  Obviously interested in the details of every deal that was done.  But as the business grew, that too changed.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/17/2000 07:53 PM 
 FYI - handled 
 I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday.  My dad is experiecing serious health problems, and he will be in Houston on Friday for an appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be going to the doctor's appointment with my dad.  Depending upon waiting room time, I may not be in the office for the 1:30 meeting in EB3305 to discuss the findings from the recent internal audit projects.  I have asked Shona Wilson to attend in my place.  Please continue with the meeting, as I know that this is a difficult meeting to schedule.  I will get an update from Shona when I get back to the office. 
 Attached - still not quite final - waiting for confirmation from Tom Gros and Philippe Bibi.   Can we add an Enron logo to the top of the first page? Thanks.    I also sent this version to Mike Jordan, Fernley Dyson and Shona for their input.  Can you e:mail a copy to Tom Hopwood?  Thanks. 
 Thanks.  I have shared these with Jeff Gossett (gas risk lead) and Scott Earnest (products risk lead).  I will be curious to hear about the plan that your DBA's have devised today.  Thanks for you help and attention to these problems. 
 See names below for your IT contacts tonight - one on 32 and one on 31.  Do you know these folks?  They should be visibly on your floors.  Let me know if that doesn't happen.  --Sally 
 My details to Jeff and Sherri 
 My details to Bill Bradford...

 Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller Forum.  Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting. All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business).  Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.   You and I talked about Monday or Tuesday afternoon, October 23 or 24.  I have tentatively put you on the agenda over lunch on Tuesday as detailed below. I hope that you can join us for lunch and address the group either before or after you eat - your choice on that.  I will call Peggy to check on your schedule, and if this does not work we can rearrange.  Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000 Time:  Noon (lunch will be served from 12:00 to 1:30) Place:  The Warwick Hotel The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 5701 Main Street Houston,  TX  77005  I have noted that your topic will be Technology's vision for supporting global trading operations.  I know that the group would also like to hear about what is going on in Enron Networks.  We can alter the topic as you would like. Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.

 As promised, although a little later than expected, a draft agenda is attached at the end of my memo to Mike.  The memo will walk you through the agenda.  Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Again, I an sorry that you will not be able to join us, but I am pleased that so many others from the London office will be in attendance.  --Sally 
 FYI - would love to have your comments or suggestions 
 FYI re: schedule 
 Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short "state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the afternoon.  Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going project.  Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker. He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office services within Enron.  Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic. Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group. After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's attendance. 
 Thanks -- 3:00 pm Thursday sounds great.  On 21 I assume?  I will see you there. 
 I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday, October 20.  My dad is experiencing serious health problems, and he is coming to Houston for a doctor's appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be going with him to the appointment.  I will have my cell phone with me (713-417-1591) and I will check messages throughout the day.  In my absence, please contact the following persons on Friday regarding trading operations issues:  Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306 Bob Hall  x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962  Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Mike Moscoso x35242  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team for their team building next Wednesday.  Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another night that week.  --Sally 
 What is the latest on this one?  I gather that they are still using spreadsheets, which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.  Are their positions not being captured and aggregated?  What does Scott Mills have to say about this?  --Sally 
 Thanks for the names and numbers.  I have just called and talked with Jonathan Beck and Jenia Nikolova; have left voice mail messages of congratulations for Jeremy Fitzpatrick, Matthew Olney, David Scott, Corrinn Sutton, and Thomas Underwood; and left a message with a roommate for Ryan White.  I did not get an answer of any kind when I tried Thomas Lowell's number.  He is the only one that I have not contacted at this point.  I will try his number again before I leave tonight.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I am open from 3:00 to 4:00 on Thursday - have to meet with Enron's legal counsel from Sydney at 4:00, followed by a 4:30 meeting with Delainey on a proposed asset sale.   I have rescheduled my meeting with the Sydney guy several times this week, and I think this may be my last shot of meeting with him during this trip.  Is an hour sufficient?  --Sally 
 FYI - Let's discuss 
 Thanks for passing along the announcement.  You are right, the grapevine news did precede this more formal annoucement!  Sounds as if this will be a fun position for you.  Thanks for all of the great work that you have done on behalf of mid and back office operations.  Your help in Helsinki earlier this year was especially wonderful.  I will call you when I next come to London and will hope that you will have time for lunch or dinner to catch up. --Sally 
 I will be there on the 25th.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Trena,  3:00 PM is fine.  Patti 
 Trena,  Per our earlier conversation, I have scheduled a meeting with you and Sally for 3:30 - 4:00 PM today (Wednesday, October 18) in her office at EB 3389.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 (Sally's Assistant) 
 I could go to Austin the night of Wednesday, October 25 for dinner with students if you need me.  Let me know.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Irfan was one of the UT students, not OU.  Just wanted to make sure that we have him on the right list.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30.  If possible, I would love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home.  The first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am.  I could easily be in Norman for a 9:00 am interview.  I can also stay for interviews on October 31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or treating with a 2 year old).  I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.  I would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU this last time.  I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago office.  I will let you know what I hear back from him.  Consider Shona Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & 31. Finally, I have noted November 10 on my calendar for the management overview.  Keep me posted on details.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 In cleaning up e:mails, I ran across this one that I had not yet read.  Has James called and talke with you about Enpower?  Are his concerns in the memo accurate?  Let me know.  --Sally 
 Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU.  Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally 
 As of Friday, October 13, it seems that this student had not heard back from Enron.  What is the timeline for getting back to students regarding Super Saturday? 
 The 13th won't work for me, unfortunately.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite meeting from Tuesday evening (Sept. 12) through Friday (Sept. 15).  If you were to arrive early enough on Tuesday, we could try to do the review before I catch the plane on Tuesday afternoon.  The only problem with that is that the VP/MD PRC is scheduled for September 11 and 12.  I don't know that the VP portion of the PRC will be completed on Monday, or that the results would be available to me on Tuesday even if the process is completed on Monday.  We have been asked to hold VP reviews until after the PRC process is completed.  I will contact you as soon as I do have the results from the PRC and we will set up a specific time for the review, either in Houston or Calgary.  Seems like it would be a good time of year for me to head north!  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 09/05/2000 12:15 PM 
 The Associates PRC was completed on Monday, July 24.  As the PRC rep, I will communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.  I received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on vacation.  I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your performance review and the ranking.  In your case, I would guess that Jean and your new supervisor will have to work out which one (or both) will do your review.  --Sally 
 The Associates PRC meeting has been rescheduled for Monday, July 24th at 9:00 am.  I have also sent an e:mail message to the associates letting them know about the new date. 
 We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results. Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.  Thanks for providing your resumes.  I will feel more informed during the process. 
 Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as soon as I know a rescheduled date.  In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in Houston.  My extension is 35926. 
 Today's Enron-wide Associates PRC meeting has been cancelled.  It was scheduled to start at 1:30 today, following the Analysts PRC.  Apparently, the Analysts PRC is running long.  Since both meetings were scheduled for the same location and with Joe Sutton as the chair, the Associates PRC has been cancelled.  I do not yet have a rescheduled date.  I will let you know when I do.  I am also sending an e:mail message to the Associates that I am representing so that they will informed of the cancellation.  Thanks for taking the time to meet or talk with me about the performance of your respective associate in preparation for the PRC. 
 I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will take place on July 19.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates to represent in the meeting as indicated on the attachment.  The Associates Program has provided me  with your name as the PRC supervisor of the associate as listed.    Please provide me with the following by Friday, July 14:  Associate's accomplishments for the first half of 2000 (prepared by the associate or summarized by you)  Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any additional rotational assignments during this first six months of the year)  Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues)  Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately representing the associate in the PRC process  Recommendation for promotion, if any  I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP system through the Associates Program.  I will be on vacation until Monday, July 17.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, will be contacting you next week to ask if you would like to meet with me for a few minutes on Monday or Tuesday, July 17 and 18 (or phone call) to discuss your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC supervisor for the associate listed on the attachment,  please reply by e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go next for this input. 
 I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London.  Pulp & paper is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.  I would not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.  We did review him in our PRC.  For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper employees by putting them under Global Products rather than ENA, a step they took I believe without any outside direction.  Does this make sense to you? --Sally

 I hope that your holiday was wonderful.  Nikki told me that you would be working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.  I will try to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 to about 7:15.  I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning. 
 Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some options on housing. 
 We did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.  I have also discussed this at length with Brent, and agree that the shift of manager positions to front to back looks across each region (eliminating the OA and Deal Validation manager roles) makes sense.  Upon the recommendation of Susan and Brent, I am comfortable with appointing Jeff Gossett as the manager of the West region. 
 Approved. Sally 
 Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.  For a woman who can't remember the last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy!  Thanks, too, for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two days.  I will take that home with me tonight and I will enjoy it during my upcoming days off.  I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.  Thanks for your enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless effort.  It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be fun.  1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - a direct result of your contributions.  I look forward to meeting new challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together. 
 I have this on my calendar and I will be there.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Glad you could make it yesterday.  I don't play (at least not in front of others), so I do look for golfers from time to time.  I will keep your number handy!    Enron Capital Management 
 Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail is much better.  I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be MUCH better.  I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday. 
 If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am on Friday?  That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews (defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess - the signed review).  The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.  Although many employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time. Thanks.  Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is the case we may be alright without the review.  But getting a second copy from Clara would probably be the best bet.  Thanks.

 I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.  I would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town.  I have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.  Part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and from around the world.  If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will probably be enhanced.  This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.  I hate the Sunday thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.  Please let Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate. 
 I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her resume.  Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in November.  I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation, and was impressed with her.  She has followed up with phone calls and this e:mail.  I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company.  Her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies. --Sally 
 Did you get to check on lunch plans for Thursday or Friday next week with directs?  This looks like it could conflict. 
 I was in Austin the end of last week recruiting at UT and (in a sense of open-mindedness and fair play) was at OU on Sunday night and Monday recruiting as well. James and I have not had a chance to talk following your conversations.  Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages.  I have some tight deadlines on a couple of things for Friday, so it may be Monday before James and I have the opportunity to talk in any detail. 
 I did find one that I have not used.  You will just need to change the information at the top of the page. 
 Attached is your actual form.  I did not have a totally blank one to forward, as I have actually done work on all evals on my disk.  So I am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template.  Hope this works! 
 Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers. However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.  The remainder are senior specialists.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail.  We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these players away.  Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our competitor, which will require that he have good people.  He will be moving to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire. He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or childless, their mobility factors could be high.  Enron would not want to lose any other talent to Steve's new employer. 
 Thanks for forwarding this contact list.  You should add my contact information to the list as well and redistribute to the team.  Thanks.  Office 713-853-5926 Home 281-370-8568 Cell  713-417-1591

 Thanks for the note, and thanks, too, for taking time on both days to talk with us.  You should hear from Lexi soon regarding the Super Saturday event. 
 It was a pleasure to meet you and to talk with someone who knows ERCOT, PJM, etc.!  Thanks for taking the time on both Wednesday and Thursday to visit with us.  You should be hearing from Lexi soon regarding our Super Saturday event.

 I hope that you got my reminder message that I was attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting today, which kept me from attending the ENW staff meeting over lunch today.  My remaining PRC obligations are as follows:  Friday, Dec. 8   Energy Operations PRC   8:00 am until ? (ENA, EGM, EIM)  Monday, Dec. 11 `  Enron Wholesale Services PRC  8:00 - 9:30 am  Wednesday, Dec. 13  Associates       7:30 am until ?  The Enron Americas Management Team Offsite scheduled for Las Vegas December 13-16 had been cancelled, so I will be in the office all of next week. 
 Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk about how we can jump start this.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps! 
 Please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list.  Thanks. 
 I always compile a contact list for Energy Operations during the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years).  Just let me know who appropriate contacts will be, especially for the DPR and MPR, during the dates that you are out.  Sounds as if you should see a white Christmas!  --Sally 
 Good input on those leather pants.  I can just picture her shopping.  We will look forward to seeing you for lunch on Saturday.  The weather looks as if it should be good for the game that night.  See you soon!

 Save the date!  October 22-24  has been reserved for the Enron-wide Operations Controller Forum to be held in Houston at the Warwick Hotel.  To accommodate the desired travel schedule of our attendees outside the Houston office, the forum will kick-off the evening of Sunday, October 22.  We will have a full day and evening on Monday, October 23, and the forum will conclude mid-afternoon on Tuesday, October 24.  Many key Enron players will join us for portions of the forum.  Speakers confirmed to date are Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford.  Details will follow in the next few days.  All hotel accommodations will be arranged by Patti and charges for these will be absorbed by my cost center. Please make your own airline reservations.  I look forward to seeing you at the forum.  This will be a unique opportunity to get know your counterparts from the wholesale, retail, and broadband segments of Enron, with contingents from the U.S., Canada, England, Australia, and Japan.  Sally 
 Thanks for looking into this for me.    Enron North America Corp. 
 It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made. His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and we will let you know when and where that will take place.  Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all aspects of this key business for North America.  Please join me in congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities. 
 FYI...I will keep you posted. 
 I had lunch with Barry yesterday and suggested that they might benefit from attending these meetings.  Hope you don't mind my extending that invitation. --Sally 
 While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs.  I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions. And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.  While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you.  Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways to turn this around. 
 Attached is a memo that I have sent to Mike Jordan regarding the Operations Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.  I want to send the official invitation early next week.  I have conferred with Mike on attendees from EEL.   Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is finalized.  Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.  Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.  If you can come, I would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.  Just let me know.  Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his participation.  I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.  Hope you have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Peggy, is the EOL bridge functionality working for you in Calgary?  Jeff Gossett was in a meeting with me on Monday this week discussing systems issues.  Beth Perlman mentioned that the EOL bridging had been completed, but Jeff spoke up and said that it was not working correctly.  You or someone on your team may want to call Jeff to understand the issues that he was having to be certain that you are happy with the functionality that you now have in Calgary.  Thanks.

 I will be recruiting at Wellsley College for the Analyst Program on Thursday, September 28.  I will fly back from Boston on Friday, September 29 and I should be back in the office between 11:30 and 12:00.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.  While I am out of the office, the following persons will serve as key contacts:  Gas Operations  Bob Hall  x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962 Steve Jackson x37070  Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Mike Moscoso x35242  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 FYI 
 4 counterparties for a total of $10.2MM makes me think that each one must be pretty large.  I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars are associated with each one -- also how likely we think that collection is in each case.  Leslie:  I know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at this point to provide this kind of detail, but it is the type of question that Dave may ask. 
 Decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her.  I suppose that if she wants others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake that we can!  (Do you think that we will be invited?)  That really sounds ugly, and I don't mean it to.  I think that your idea was a great one, but if she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.  Let me know when the deliberation process is completed!  --Sally 
 This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for sending the dates in writing.  We already have this on our home calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.  I did confirm that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.  The weather should be great here then.  I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do something fun with the kids -- zoo, Children's Museum, etc.  I sent Mo an e:mail message about your stay in Houston in hopes that she may need to be in Houston at that time.  I will let you know what I hear from her. 
 Is this a timeline for all of ENA, or just for the accounting group? 
 Good memo - let me know if you see results.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hope are things in London?  I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here she will be about six months pregnant.  I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, who was on his first day here.  We could also schedule a First City reunion if you could be here.  If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects for a lunch or happy hour.  I may need to head to London in October or November.  I will let you know if my travel plans develop.  I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain climbing!!!!!!!  How was it?  I will be anxious to hear.  --Sally 
 I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  --Sally 
 This request is approved.  Your request forms that you send still don't provide enough information in layman's terms so that I know what you are asking to be approved.  Are we working on this? 
 I can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved. Since Gregory's address looks as if he is at Corp., just let me know who he is and what I am being asked to approve.  Please reply with history attached.  Thanks. --Sally 
 This is fine.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 FYI - yes, my response was lengthy! 
 Would you please forward a copy of our current draft of operating standards to Shawn?  Thanks. 
 Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.  In fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices worldwide, a "what time is it there if I am here" page, etc.  I would like for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan widely at this point.  However, I thought that I would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts. 
 Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a row, January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for you?  And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon!! 
 Thanks for following up on this. 
 This is hilarious!  I am laughing outloud!! 
 I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?  Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave you some.  --Sally 
 This employee, and his supervisor, Bob Schorr, do not report in to me. Someone else should be approving this requested access. 
 Geynille,  Sally will not be able to attend Sept. 27 Intern offer dinner, but will attend presentation dinner on Sept. 28.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Thanks for your list.  I have talked with Brent and of the three names that you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their locations - weather, coal, etc.  I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully decline! 
 Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate party!)  We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan.  We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you have a list of what is available for those schools? 
 Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio November 15-17.  Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save the date than to provide any detail at this point).  If you have not received your invitation, please let me know. 
 It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.  I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have done a great job in changing and promoting the program.  I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully with a change in our strategy!  If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold.  On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know -- we can probably place a few orders through you! 
 Please put this on my calendar.  I don't know if I will make it there, but I would like for it to be on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Yes, he is working on the short list.  I do have to say, however, that I have not had questions from him on any of those names.  I will leave him a voice mail message for an update. 
 I know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had anticipated in SAP.  I also know that there are several things where we have to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in SAP.  We also have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within SAP and a mismatch of that timing with our business processes.  There was a concerted effort kicked off by the SAP team last week to try and identify and resolve issues.  They met with my direct reports.  However, we have to reconvene as we ran out of time to cover all issues!  I have asked Leslie Reeves and Bryce to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully understand how much of this issue was attributable to human versus system.  I will get back with you as I know more details and as I can share with you our list of first "hits" for SAP fixes or enhancements.  Thanks for sharing this with me.  --Sally 
 Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that he is doing better.  I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will be very interested in the gosipy details.  Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 27 packages of fudge. 
 I have read this series of e:mails but I am not sure that I fully understand the issue.  Did Willie not do his job?  Are there problems with how SAP works?  Are both of these an issue?  Please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with SAP and netting.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Debbie,  FYI, Sally Beck will be flying up afternoon of Sept. 28.  Please make her reservation for 28th only.  Also, do you have the address of Stone Davis Hall where dinner & presentation will be held?  I need that for her itinerary. And lastly, can you put me on cc: list for Wellesley info.  It's just makes it easier for me.  Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally Beck's Assistant) 
 I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report. After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format.  In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation. --Sally 
 Geynille,  Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28. Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Diana,  Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru. If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.  She will be in training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is available.

 This employee and his/her manager, Bob Schorr, do not report in to me.  This approval should be sent to someone else. 
 I will take a look at my calendar and let you know when I can come north.  I am heading to the airport in 5 minutes for a flight to Austin to make a presentation at UT tonight, capping off about four weeks with a lot of travel for me.  I will catch my breath on the plan and look at my schedule for the next few weeks and I will let you know.  I sat by Sheila Knudsen at the ENA staff meeting on Friday afternoon last week, and asked her if we should now schedule VP reviews.  The VP PRC meeting (much rescheduled) did take place on September 11 and 12.  Sheila said that as of Friday (the 15th) that HR had not received the final results from the PRC, and that we should wait on reviews until we had that in hand.  I will check with HR this week so see if all is finalized, so that we can schedule the review.  I will keep you posted.     Peggy Hedstrom 09/20/2000 12:18 PM 
 Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes. Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and organizational work.  I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.  Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated

 As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by approximately 10:00 am Houston time.   Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London requirement for officialized books.  The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time. We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report earlier in the morning.  Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London. 
 Margarite,  I think you may have the wrong Sally Beck again.  Might want to check your address list for future distributions.  Patti x39106    Enron North America Corp. 
 I am not trying to twist any arms with this question, but is there anything we can do so that Jody can make the presentation at OU?  Since he was the top graduate from the Energy Management Program at OU, it would be great for him to be at the presentation next Tuesday night.  I know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing, but it is also time well spent.  I do know that Jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him I will understand.  I just wanted you to take a look at this.  Thanks. 
 I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President. This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.  It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and above.  Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project!  Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.  You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.  Sally 
 I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.  I will leave the offsite meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common needs around risk systems.  I will be in the office the afternoon of September 15.  Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I can be reached.  Key contacts while I am out are listed below:  Natural Gas Operations  Steve Jackson   x37070 Bob Hall   x36956 Leslie Reeves  x37962 Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870 Leslie Reeves  x37962  DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242 MPR      David Maxwell  x36983 
 Please print and start a file for me for year-end PRC 2000. Yikes!! Thanks. 
 I am not aware of an Enron-wide issue, but it would seem strange that two such instances occurred within your group.  You may want to contact someone in security to give them the details so that they can investigate. 
 Yes, Mary Solmonson from Energy Operations has volunteered to host a student in the Job Shadowing program.  Mary may have one of her directors host the student.  Please use Mary Solmonson as the primary contact for this program. Her extension is 36079.  Thanks.     Susan Skarness 09/12/2000 02:45 PM 
 Who are these guys and should someone from our group meet with them? 
 Great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon on OPM.  The presentation and your comments were direct and concise.  And your delivery of the information was very well done -- you were poised, organized, prepared and confident.  It was an effective and informative presentation to the group.  Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project. 
 I was out of town last week doing some recruiting, so I am just reading your e:mail today.  I have passed this along to Lisa Cousino and she should be getting back to you.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
 Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch! Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)  Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week - really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have been doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be off the week of December 18th. 
 This came in while I was in Austin last week, so I am just reading it today. Any thoughts on this one?  --Sally

 Does this make sense to you?  Seems like they may have the wrong person.  Can you follow up?  Thanks. 
 Please set up a 30 minute meeting for me with Dave.  Thanks.=20 
 Thanks for you message.  I am glad to know that you like what you see in the office to date.  I am planning a trip to Chicago soon, so I will look forward to seeing you there.

 It was good to see you last week, too.  That was a big group, and there were many people that I just passed in the halls!  I would love to participate, but I will be out of town on September 14.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite meeting from Septemer 13-15 in San Antonio.  Thanks for thinking of me. --Sally 
 Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for Clickpaper.com.  Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that effort as well.  I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on their efforts and yours.  Welcome to Enron.  It was nice to meet you last week.  --Sally 
 The week of September 11 is not a great week for me.  I am out of the offic= e=20 from Tuesday at noon through Friday afternoon, so my Monday and Tuesday=20 morning are already booked!  I checked to see if there was anything that I= =20 could bump off the schedule for Monday, but I am doing several performance= =20 reviews and have Richard Sage here from London to go over several things. = =20  The next week, I am at a Communications training session on Monday, Septemb= er=20 18 and then will be in a V@R class on Thursday and Friday, September 21 and= =20 22.  Let's try for Tuesday or Wednesday that week, the 19th or 20th.  I hav= e=20 Patti checking on some travel details for me.  I have to make a presentatio= n=20 for recruiting in Austin on Wednesday late afternoon or evening.  Let me kn= ow=20 what works for you.  --Sally=20 
 January 27th and February 24th sound good.  Meagan has a big dance on Jan. 27th, and I need to be here to help with prep and to take pictures.  February 17th is our anniversary (22nd!!), so that is probably not a good date either.  So if you can make one of the other two dates work, I would love to come.  Just keep me posted. 
 I already have a meeting scheduled for Friday from 2:00 to 2:30.  I will join you in the facilitator training as soon as that meeting concludes--it may not last a full 30 minutes.  In case I can not make the meeting, I have printed the attachment.  Thanks. 
 I would like to participate in this focus group, however, I will be returning from Austin on Friday morning following the Enron scholarship dinner the night before.  I am scheduled to land at Hobby at 8:45 am.  It is unlikely that I will be in the Enron Building before about 9:15, and I am scheduled to go into a meeting at 9:30 that involves a number of players and would be difficult to reschedule.  If your responses from participants for the Friday session is thin, and you schedule another time, please let me know.  I have been out of the office on business for the last several days (recruiting at UT yesterday) and returned mid-morning today to a full schedule.  I am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond by noon today as you had asked.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the resume.  I have been out of town the last several business days, so I am just now catching up on e:mails.  David told me that he ran into you at lunch.  Small world...  How are things going for you?  I hope that this was a good move for you. --Sally 
 Brenda,  Sally is out of the office today.  Patti x39106 
 October 20th sounds great -- we will reserve the guest room for you! 
 Please print all attachments for me.  Thanks. 
 I was able to get into the application this time.  I could see the request for Shona on the screen and I clicked "Approval".  The status did not change from pending and there was no pop up on the screen that indicated that the request was processed.  So I do not know if this worked. 
 Sally is in Dallas for an offsite - she will return to office Friday (Sept 1).  If you can forward contract to me, I will see that she signs it asap.  Patti x39106 EB 3388 
 Sally's internal address is:  EB 3389  Temporary fax # is 713-646-8029  Patti x39106 (Sally's Assistant) 
 Please set up a meeting with Steve and Beth as soon as we can.  I believe that Beth is out sick at the present. 
 I have confirmed your attendance with your assistant.  Please notify me if you are unable to attend.  Thanks, Patti x39106  Date:  Wednesday, December 6 Time: 2:00 - 2:30 PM Location: 32C2 Subject: Book officialization process in RiskRAC (Meeting to be led by Shona Wilson) Attendees: Matt Brown Michelle Bruce Scott Earnest Jeff Gossett Todd Hall Peggy Hedstrom (by phone) Brenda Herod Mike Moscoso Brent Price Kathy Reeves (by phone) Martha Stevens Stacey White Shona Wilson 
 I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to "catch up", if you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going basis.  I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled.  I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible. 
 Here are the home games when Meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine:  Friday, September 15  7:00 pm  Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm  Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming)  There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.  I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.  Patti has sent you a copy of my itinerary. 
 I'm trying again! 
 I think that we sent this to the wrong e:mail address at first... 
 Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.  These days with Mom and Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.  That way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to come up.  Hopefully, never needed!  Have a great time in New York later this week.  I sent you a newspaper article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave. 
 I will be in Dallas from Tuesday, August 29 through Thursday, August 31 at an offsite session hosted by Rick Causey to review the SAP implementation and next steps.  The linkage of Unify and our Global Databases to SAP is a critical one, and decisions around next steps can impact these operating systems and our processes.  Therefore, Rick has asked that I attend.  Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), has telephone numbers where I can be reached if needed.  In my absence, please contact the following persons in Houston with questions.  Peggy Hedstrom is the appropriate contact in Calgary.  Natural Gas Operations  Steve Jackson   x37070 Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870  DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242 MPR      David Maxwell  x36983  I will be back in the office on Friday, September 1. 
 I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on Friday evening.  Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group. His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe. Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four year-old daughter.  Several of us will be attending the funeral today.  Over the past several weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic association.  Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded. 
 Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B. on any of this?  It might be helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two additional paper mills that we may purchase.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I have let Lexi know that I have a conflict with this meeting time -- I will be doing a business review meeting with Jeff Skilling on global risk management operations at 10:00 on September 7th.  I just wanted you to know that I continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at OU.  I have asked Lexi to update me on the meeting.  --Sally 
 I can't make 10:00 on September 7th.  I have a business review meeting scheduled with Jeff Skilling at that time.  FYI:  Bob Klein has resigned from the company effective August 31.  Let me know what I miss in the meeting. Thanks.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Shona,  I printed 12/4 consolidated report for Sally.  It is again very small.  Any possibility that you can change format to enlarge (very large margins).  I can go in every time & reformat, but it seems a waste of time to do every time when you can just change your template once.  PT    Enron North America Corp.

 I will be at the presentation.  I can not make a faculty lunch that day -- it's my mother's birthday and she lives in Austin, so I have already committed to lunch with her.  Just let me know the details on how soon you would like for me to arrive at the Alumni Center, and if there is anything else that I can do.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Wow - thanks for copying me on these.  --Sally 
 Let's let her float in that vision for a while... 
 It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.  After you have received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested.  I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.  I will reserve judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses. 
 Not too mountainous, but I am sure that would be fun.  It's kind of hard to fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that could be tough.  Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  We are having a great year here at Enron, especially in the business unit that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for everyone. 
 No manager is listed below on this request and I don't know the employee. The manager blank must be completed for me to be able to address these. Without that, I can't possibly tell what group this person is working in and whether or not it makes sense to grant the system access.  Please return this to me for my approval when complete. 
 FYI - I responded to Sharron. 
 RSVP:  Yes, I will attend.  I will arrive in San Antonio in time for the dinner on Tuesday evening.  Count me out for golf on Wednesday - I don't think they would want me to play!

 In cleaning up e:mails, I can across this one from Sheila.  Is this one of the corrections that was made to the June information?  Any update on July? Thanks. 
 Thanks for letting us know about Blake.  I just tried to reach him and left a congratulatory message on his answering machine. 
 The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process along with Peggy and Brent.)  On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your calendars:  November 15-17.  Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these. 
 Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense. While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good option.  I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a note then if there are any other comments that I have.  I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person sometime in the not too distant future.  Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join us. 
 Do you know who this is?  I don't recognize the manager's name.  Thanks. 
 I received the note about the Wellesley recruiting team meeting on Thursday. I will look forward to seeing you there.  Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?  I will be there.  I did let Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the teachers.  With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so that I can best support her in school.  Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team will be there for the duration.  I look forward to seeing you there, too! --Sally 
 On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's cars.  On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of money for a school project.  Last night, the magazine made it into my hands around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.  What a nice article!  I smiled while reading it.  How nice to see your accomplishments recognized in print.  Congratulations.  I hope that you have plenty of copies for your mom and dad.  --Sally 
 Glad you got some rain.  We are still doing lots of watering on the yard.  No water rationing in our area yet, but it has been put in place in many areas in and around Houston.  I have to be in Austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on September 5, so I thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and have lunch for your birthday.  I haven't made flight reservations yet, but I am sure that I can work it to be at the University Club by 12:15.  Looks as if the whole family will go to Hallettsville on the 9th.  David and I will enjoy the drive, and I am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on the way over! 
 Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.  It does not work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put into production?  I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally okayed the access for Bob Hall.  Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system is fixed.  My number is 35926.  I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and timing. 
 I will be at the meeting on the 24th. 
 Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.  Beverly Scott, with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.  She offered to call all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.  I was planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that I decided to take her up on it.  She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a list of names and numbers).  I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't called everyone on the list.  I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I know that she is working on it.  Just a little more slowly than I would like!  I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today and make calls.  Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.  Her number at work is 281-444-0751. 
 I met with Karen Marshall today.  She is in the Community Relations group and is organizing the dinner on September 7th.  I suggested that she add to the invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this summer).  I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know people at the school. I will keep you posted.  --Sally 
 I am not available to interview on December 7th.  I will be in a PRC meeting.  Try me next time!  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Was Lisa a recent hire that Susan Harrison brought in?  I don't immediately recognize her name, but wonder if that's who this is.  Also, I left you a message about Bob Klein's resignation, as I learned from Jeff Sorenson.  I am sure that Jeff has communicated this to you.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please print the attachment for me in color ( I have to put that burnt orange on my bulletin board), put this event on my calendar and research flight information for me.  I would fly over on the afternoon of the 7th and back on the morning of the 8th.  Check with Karen to see if she is handling hotel reservations, or if we should make those.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the follow up.  Please move forward with this offer with the sign on payment.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  Please let me know if these look like the final ones.  Thanks for your help.  Patti x39106 
 This was sent for my approval.  The manager listed below does not work in Energy Operations.  This should be sent to someone else for approval. 
 Same time, same place -- just not as often!  I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global Markets.  I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time together on an as needed basis. 
 If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in response from others. But do let me know... 
 I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has for you. I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work for me.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I like the trip idea better than a party, personally, so I am glad that Mom and Dad seemed to like that alternative.  And in June, I think that the mountains sound great.  I have a preference for Western mountains -- big, open sky  (Grand Tetons could be great), but if Mom pictures North Carolina as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) that look nice.  I will see if I can find the names of those places.  Thanks for pursuing this with Mom and Dad.  --Sally 
 The record on Friday showed that 127 employees from Energy Operations had pledged dollars to the United Way campaign.  Large number, but still percentage-wise smaller than we would like.  I sent the message below to all Energy Operations employees on Friday afternoon.  We'll see in a few days if this helped on contributions.  Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:  Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.  Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by Enron.  If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.  Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge. 
 Please print this memo and attachments in color for me.  Thanks. --Sally

 I have this on my calendar.  At this point, I do not plan to bring anyone else to the meeting.  --Sally    Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 Sorry that I missed you this morning.  I attended that last Financial Council meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert and Rick Causey.  Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine that we didn't get to talk today.  I had wanted to be prepared on how to address out current activities there.  So I can get an update on that when we talk tomorrow.  I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00 tomorrow.   I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting. 
 I got your voice mail message and I understand your concerns around Todd's time.  I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's help would be needed.  I think that we can review the "to do" list from James and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work, etc.  As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency (remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all of the work.  I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as the contracted hired help!  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 
 I will be there!  --Sally 
 Todd is completing his short-term role on the CommodityLogic team, and it is my hope that he will be able to provide some help for you after that is completed, while also working in his role with Weather.  I have sent a message to Brent and I am sure that we will talk.  --Sally 
 As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly without the family.  Can we still use Todd ? 
 Thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program.  It will help to have that info in my meeting on Friday. 
 Cathy:  slight wording change from Rick Causey:  add words at beginning of third sentence in italics and drop the phrase "on accounting issues and reporting earnings" at the end of that third sentence.  Thanks.  Clear as mud?  --Sally   Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, business controller for Global Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business controller for Weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for Global Products and Coal.  In addition, Tom Myers has joined Brent's management team as Director of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 
 Call or e:mail - either one is great.  I do hope that you are working with James directly on these issues as they surface.  It is still not clear to me whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues.  I will always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that will insure better information.  Because I can't personally do all of the work, I just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with the right management team members on my team.  I don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work.  I believe that the manual process that moves information from the Entelligence team to GCP has apparently not worked as well as was designed.  While sorry that the results haven't been as expected, we are glad to have your input now to help address this.  James has reassigned the resources from Entelligence for now to work with Mary Gosnell on updates to GCP that I understand have been prioritized with you. 
 I am resending this memo regarding the information that I need from you as Cheryl Ingstad's supervisor as I prepare to represent her in the Associates PRC meeting next week.  I am tied up in other PRC meetings on December 7, 8 and 11, so I am doing my homework earlier rather than later this week. Please note the bullet points in the memo below which outline the information that I need.  I do have copies of the internal feedback forms and Cheryl's self-evaluation.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I know that things are very busy right now, but it is important to the Associates that their reps in the PRC process are well prepared.  Your input will help me with that.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Rick:  This is a draft of the language to be used in a McConnell/Shankman memo to go out on their new organization.  I worked with Mike on the language for this paragraph.  Any comments or suggested changes? Mike would like to send this out ASAP, ideally this afternoon.  Thanks for taking a look.  draft  Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management Operations.  He will coordinate with Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Corp., on accounting issues and reporting earnings.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, business controller for Global Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business controller for Weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for Global Products and Coal.  In addition, Tom Myers has joined Brent's management team as Director of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 
 Please put this on my calendar.  I assume that this every other week meeting will replace the weekly Friday meeting.  Thanks. 
 Should have sent you a copy of this... 
 As a result of the creation of the Global Markets business in the last few days, I would add the following persons to the attendee list for the ASE in Dallas:  Brent Price  VP Operations and CAO, Global Markets Tom Myers  Director of Accounting, Global Markets  Brent is in London this week, and will be on vacation the week of August 21. With the demands of a new role, Brent will be best able to address the feasibility of one or both of them attending. 
 Can you join me at this meeting?  I plan to talk with Tom Gros tomorrow to let him know that you will be the liasion with CommodityLogic for Energy Operations.  Then I thought that we could both attend this next meeting as a transition.  Then it's on your calendar after that !  --Sally 
 Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number. I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during my commute tonight again.  Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally 
 Thanks for the update on Dad.  Keep me posted on what you hear.  No, I didn't get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!  I will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from work.  --Sally 
 I am sorry that you won't be here to join us for the lunch for Kristin.  It was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine.  Since this is her last official week with ENA, I did want to do this before she starts her new assignment.  --Sally 
 I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 instead of August 28.   I will keep you posted.  I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's new role.  I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.  I am confident that this will work well. 
 FYI:  Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.  By voice mail, I suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.  We are set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over lunch.  I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.  Rick Causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.  Any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?  Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine.  --Sally 
 I'm glad to know that she is home.  I can just imagine how much fun those oxygen treatments will be!  I know that you will be thankful to have your whole family under the same roof.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/01/2000 05:47 PM 
 Life is busy at Enron and I literally receive hundreds of e:mails every week.  This is not the best way to communicate with me on priority issues.  I have looked at your proposal and would be interested in learning more.  Can you provide more details beyond your presentation?  What is your background and experience?  Can you provide information on your company? 
 I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.  If you look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.  His e:mail to Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's group.  Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest.  I don't think that HR gets involved in this process.  I am not sure how I got into this loop.  It seems that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with Nelson.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Definitely clever!  I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math skills.  I will definitely look into that for Meagan.  I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the beans, but no movement on that yet!  I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz; not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs: a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season. I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs will be next week.  I will keep you posted.  Have a great weekend.  Love, Sally 
 The employee for whom access if requested is not an employee of Energy Operations.  I would assume that with his supervisor listed as Ed Baughman, that he is in a commercial origination group.  Someone else should be reviewing and approving this. 
 That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day "sucked".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily I didn't have to go that far.  Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally 
 Thanks for copying me on this.  It is interesting to see your thoughts.  I suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions. 
 Do we have these numbers for Hector? 
 Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve.  Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses. Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28. That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month.  What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late. 
 I don't know Mog Hue.  Please return this request to the person who originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.  By including the manager's name, that will help me to identify who this person is, what job they perform and whether or not the request makes sense.  I have over 400 people in my group, so without more detail on these requests it is not worth taking my time to approve these.  --Sally 
 I don't know Sabrina Rank.  Please return this request to the person who originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.

I have over 400 people in my group, so without more detail on these requests it is not worth taking my time to approve these.  --Sally 
 I have been on jury duty since Tuesday this week - I had Patti call Chris today and let him know that I would get back with him next week.  I will keep you posted as I have time to focus on that next week.  Thanks for following up!  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 David is doing well, too.  He is working contract, having quit Burlington Resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible. Yes, Tammy is still with us.  We marked our 10 year anniversary with her in March, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in Kentucky.  I truly am blessed.  --Sally 
 Can you arrange with Bobbi?  Thanks. 
 Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.  I saw Amy Leeand Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.  Please pass the kudos along to the rest of your team.  The theme was timely, the staging was great, the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.  (I knew the WLEC 1 answer!)  I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.  Their programs are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the children in the shelter. 
 To all Energy Operations employees:  ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth. I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.  To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will; to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools" and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses. Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input.  Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.  Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid. Thank you.  Sally 
 Can you help me on this?  Can you give me the name of someone who sends messages from ARSystem@ect.com?  To make matters even more frustrating, when I tried to e:mail back to get some clarification, I got a message that said my e:mail was undeliverable.  No contact name, no phone number, and no ability to e:mail back.  I'm stuck!!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Is there a person who can attach a name and number to this request?  I receive many requests daily and I have yet to any two alike.  Makes it tough on someone to act on these, especially when sent with a name.  When I click on the address included in this message, someone else's name comes up (Steve Beck).  I don't know who you are, what you want me to do, or if you even have the right person. 
 I can't shed any light on the topic choice.  Surely you can redirect the topic.   Brent may have more info. --Sally 
 It was great to see a friendly face!  Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in and say hello.  Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so many others.  My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is "two and a half".  What a delight he continues to be!!  I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing well.  --Sally 
 There is a problem with this process.  When Sally goes to website & enters her ID & password, steve.beck comes up - not sally.beck.  Until this is fixed, she will be unable to process these requests.  Please either fix this or find another way for her to approve.  Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally Beck's Assistant) 
 I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th was not opened by HR.  Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for clarification on Brent Price.  This was the second e:mail that I had sent to Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.  My first message had noted for Kim that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.  Can you clarify this for me?  Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.  Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level:  Superior  Excellent Strong Satisfactory    Needs Improv.  Issues  VP's      Price  Hedstrom Hall  Sr. Directors Solmonson Reeves Herod Scribner  Directors  Thomas  Mills  Superty Henenberg Perez Wilson   Venturatos 
 The United Way Executive Solicitiation is underway.  You should have received an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you this year pledges should be made on line.  Mark Frevert reminded everyone at today's ENA staff meeting to complete their pledges by Tuesday, August 8.  If you have not already done so, I would encourage you to complete your pledges before Tuesday.  Patti Thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this.  Peggy:  United Way may not apply in Canada, so ignore this if not appropriate. 
 Yeah!!  Yes, staff meeting is 2:30 to 3:30 on Mondays in EB3014  - convenient for you at this point. 
 Please note:  Per Sally, the 9:00 AM Doorstep meeting scheduled for Friday (tomorrow) is being shortened to 30 minutes (now 9:30-10:00 AM).  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 FYI 
 I left you a return voice mail regarding Scott.  Let me know if I did  not understand the role that you are trying to fill. I hope that Jo likes Dr. Moore.  I thought that everyone in his office was so warm and friendly.      Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 08/03/2000 11:20 AM 
 Requesting update access for what?  (can't tell from this request what it is that you want me to approve)  Is this request for Sheila Glover or Rebecca Ford?  (unclear)  Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.  Is this supposed to be her title?   She is not a trader.  She is a Business Controller.  Can you provide some clarification so that I can act upon this?  Thanks for your earlier phone message, Leola.  This is still a bad process and the information is not sufficient to give an approval. 
 Kristin will be working for EBS at the time of this class, reporting to Barry Pearce.  Please contact Kristin or Barry for the appropriate RC within EBS to charge for the fee for this class.  If you charged ENA at the time of enrollment, please reverse that charge.  Thanks. 
 To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000. His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that category. 
 Hope that the trip goes well.  It should be interesting to look at that business.  Keep me posted.  --Sally 
 This was great -- and I saw myself in a number of these!!  It must be too long -- but that is who I am right now!  --Sally 
 Sorry that I didn't get to call you on my way to the courthouse yesterday. I was conducting lots of business back and forth with the Houston office during the drive and just ran out of time.  We reconvene in court this morning, to have what I hope will be final deliberation on sentencing, having found the guy guilty on both counts,  (Prior to the start of a trial, the defendant must choose either judge or jury to administer the sentence if the defendant is found guilty - he chose the jury.)  I am in the office now for an 8:30 meeting with Jeff Skilling regarding the upcoming Associates PRC meeting, to which I am a rep.  If I don't get a chance to reach you today, I will call during my commute tomorrow.  --Sally  By the way, I thought that when I put "Energy Executive" as my occupation on the jury summons form, that I would be deemed to be too conservative and too corporate to be chosen for the jury.  Not the case!  In fact, Mark Koenig (Enron's EVP of Investor Relations) was summoned for jury duty on Tuesday as well, and he too was chosen to be on a different jury!  The whole thing is actually very fascinating - just bad timing for me to be out so much this week.  But then, there never is a good time. 
 Can't remember at this point what the question was!  Thanks for following up -- I will call you if I remember.  --Sally 
 Did you mean to send that e:mail to me?  It was Greek to me, and I assume that the Sally it was meant for was that Sally Conover.  Feels like a Monday, doesn't it?  --Sally 
 Sally is out of the office today, but checking her calendar for Wed or Thurs of that week, it looks like Wednesday, Aug 9 would be a good day for her. She or I will confirm that date with you when she returns to the office on Monday.  Patti x39106    Enron North America Corp. 
 Tom,  FYI, Sally has changed her plans slightly - She will now be back in the office Monday morning (7/31).  Patti 
 FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be back in the office on Wednesday of next week.  Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next Wednesday.  If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next. 
 I will be out of the office from Wednesday, July 26 through Friday, July 28. I am taking my older daughter on a preliminary look at colleges.  I will have my cell phone with me -- the number is 713-417-1591.   My assistant, Patti Thompson, will have hotel phone numbers where I can be reached as well.  The following persons will be key contacts for trading operations while I am out:  Natural Gas Operations  Brent Price   x37647   (7/31 & 8/1:  Steve Jackson x37070) Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870   (7/31 & 8/1:  Kristin Albrecht x34763) Financial Products Operations Sheila Glover  x33210 Coal, Pulp & Paper, LNG  Scott Earnest  x31746 Weather     Todd Hall    x31957  DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242 MPR      David Maxwell  x316983  I will be working in ENA's and MG's Chicago offices on Monday and Tuesday, July 31 and August 1.  Patti has contact numbers for me at both offices. Key contacts in Houston are those listed above, with changes noted for Gas and Power Operations on July 31 and August 1.  I will be back in the Houston office on Wednesday, August 2. 
 I will be in the Chicago office on Monday, July 31.  I will be sorry to miss a lunch at Brennan's!  Enjoy  it without me.  --Sally 
 Brenda,  Per my earlier email, Sally will be out of the office Wed-Fri of this week, so she will be unable to attend.  PT 
 Joya,  I put in on Sally's calendar.  Patti 
 FYI 
 To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge. The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.  I will be back here working after trial hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the proceedings.  I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is fulfilled!  Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.  I sat by Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve on another jury. 
 The following persons will be in attendance at 11:30 am in EB50M on July 21st for lunch, in addition to the two of you:  Enron Employees:  Shawn Cumberland - President and COO, CALME (UT BBA; UT JD) Sally Beck - VP, ENA and Global Risk Management Operations (UT BBA; UT MBA) Brent Price - VP, ENA (UT PPA) David Mitchell - Associate (recent grad - UT MBA) Jennifer Martinez - Associate (recent grad - UT MBA) Luis Mena - Analyst (recent UT grad) Catherine Pernot (recent UT grad) Lexi Elliott - Analyst Program - UT Recruiter Christy Young - Associate Program - UT Recruiter   UT Summer Associates: Cantekin Dincerler Steven Luong Michelle Sandner Adam Thomas  UT Summer Analysts: Brenton Baxter Matt Davis Eric Efron Katherine Jett Jiyeon Kim Joanna Li Dana Lipp Amy Mohan Denise Olson Neil Rajan Angelique Woods  Thanks for making the time to attend.  This should be a great opportunity to meet with these UT students as they near the end of their summer internships with Enron. 
 Sounds like fun, and you are definitely planning ahead! 
 FYI - My reply to Peggy 
 I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night). Together we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.  We will keep you posted on both items.  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 07/19/2000 12:02 PM 
 How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can fill you in on the details in that situation.  Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary? 
 I have been traveling on business and also have just returned from vacation, so I have not yet seen the proposal that you referenced.  I will hopefully discover it as I go through my inbox in the next few days. 
 Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally 
 Please join Sally Beck, Rick Causey, David Haug and all the UT Summer Interns for lunch this Friday, July 21 at 11:30 AM.  Location will be EB 50M Dining Room.  Please RSVP to me by email or phone.  We look forward to seeing you!  Thanks, Patti x39106 Sally Beck's Assistant 
 Confirmation of date & time for UT Summer Analysts & Associates Luncheon:  Date:  Friday, July 21 Time: 11:30 AM Location: EB 50M Dining Room 
 This is my first day back from vacation.  We need to augement e:mail so that requests sent when someone is on vacation can be routed elsewhere if urgent.  This is request is approved.  Why are there so many different formats for granting systems access?  Some have an approval button, some don't.  You requested a return e:mail.  It seems as if each time I look at one of these it is different.  The status button and detail button below contain no information. 
 Flight times are good.  Please insure that my hotel reservation is for a non-smoking room.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Bobbie,  Sally is on vacation this week, but she can be available for that meeting unless she has to travel to NYC next week.  I will put it on her calendar & will confirm with you as soon as I know more (Monday at the latest).  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Per Sally's instructions - I am forwarding this document to you.  Patti x39106 
 James,  I didn't see your name on the distribution for this so I'm forwarding it to you.  Patti 
 Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey for reference during that process.  Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good. All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this. 
 I will be hosting a cookout at my home for OU summer interns, recently hired OU grads and the OU recruiting team on Sunday, July 30th in the late afternoon.  More details will follow soon, but I wanted to let you know the date so that you can hold this on your calendar.  I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.  And my husband will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow Sooners! 
 Thanks for the update.  I am confident that with leadership from you and attention from Bryce that AEC will be satisfied soon.  --Sally 
 Rob:  Let me know if you get feedback from AEC that does not indicate that they are getting what they need.  Susan and Bryce are both very capable and responsive, so I am confident that AEC's questions can be resolved quickly. --Sally 
 Please join us for an informal lunch on Friday, July 21st in the dining room in EB50M.   Rick Causey, Enron's executive lead for the Analyst Program, and David Haug, Enron's executive lead for the Associates Program, have been invited to join us as well.  We are interested in renewing acquaintances with those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom we did not see in the interview process.  We hope that you are enjoying your summer assignments at Enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit over lunch.  Please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch. 
 Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should be the end of July.  Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24. This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you updated on this as I get direction from him.  Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  Also please note the following:  Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process as well.) Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team, or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment.  Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a meaningful one.       It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0 
 Just a reminder for Monday to get this for me.  Too bad they didn't deliver these!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Is there anything that I can do to help you and Jo?  Tyler has school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but my nanny is at home with him on the other days. Would it help for her to take Albert?  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/28/2000 05:46 PM 
 Brenda:  I mentioned to Tom that I will be on vacation the week of July 10, so I will not attend the July 12th meeting.  Please remind him of that. Thanks. 
 I heard from Andrew regarding the status of a business continuity plan. Attached is a short presentation that he sent me that I thought you would like to see.  Any interest in meeting with Andrew to get more detail?  I plan to get with him.  Let me know and I will be glad to set something up. 
 Just wanted to let you know where we will be over the next week.  I am still at the office hoping to get away before dinner so that I can head home and pack.  I will call when we are back in Houston on Sunday, July 16.  Mom and Dad, hope that you have fun if you are going on your trip!

 Just a reminder about my being on vacation next week.  I also wanted to let you know that I gave your names as contacts while I am out!  --Sally 
 As mentioned, I will be out on vacation next week.  This contact list should be helpful if you need anything while I am out.  --Sally 
 Lunch on August 2nd works well for me.  I have it on the calendar.  I am planning a cook-out at my house on Sunday, July 30th for Enron summer interns from OU and recent hires from OU.  Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join us.  If you are in Houston, I hope that you will be able to join us too. Probably around 5:00 PM -- invitations should go out in the next few days with specifics.  Wanted to get the date on your calendar, however.  Let me know if you will be in town.  --Sally 
 This looks good.  Please send this wherever it should go.  Thanks. 
 Home and cell phone number are correct.  I do not have a pager.  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office on vacation from Monday, July 10 through Friday, July 14.  Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), has telephone numbers where I can be reached if needed.  In my absence, please contact the following persons in Houston with questions.  Peggy Hedstrom is the appropriate contact in Calgary.

 What do these changes do to you?  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.  I should have had these for you on Tuesday for your PRC.  Hopefully, better late than never.  I am not certain how the coporate-wide PRC process will work in late July for VP's.  I have provided a copy of this to Dave Delainey for the ENA PRC which will take place on July 7.  I thought that I would provide you a copy as well.  I will also have Patti deliver a hard copy to Sharron next week. 
 Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.  I will also ask my assistant to deliver a hard copy to you on Wednesday, July 5.  Let me know if you have any questions or need more information.   Thanks. 
 End of July should be fine.  I am planning to be out July 26, 27 and 28, taking our 16 year-old on a tour of some college campuses before she starts her junior year.  Motivational, I hope!  --Sally 
 Welcome to Enron.  I'm glad that you made the decision to come here. Hopefully, that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of time!  Look for Kristin Albrecht and Leslie Reeves in power on 31.  They know more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor.  They both report to me.  Kristin heads risk management and Leslie leads operations. They can help you on any details about our power business.  My office is on the 30th floor - EB3015.  Stop by if you get the chance.  I will be moving to the 33rd floor during the week of July, actually while I am on vacation.  Have a great long weekend.  --Sally 
 Esther,  Thanks for forwarding documents for Sally.  She is also interested in Chicago - are there Chicago documents you can also forward to her?  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to schedule a photographer.  I will be in the office next week, Wednesday through Friday.  Then I will be on vacation the week of July 10th.  Let me know when the photographer will come, so that I will know what to wear! Thanks, and have a great long weekend.  --Sally 
 Esther,  Sally would like to view these documents now - is this on an "S" drive?  If so, how does she access.  Patti x39106

 Attached is Bob Superty's summary of the impact on the late noms today.  We do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type is "Intraday", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms were late.  Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today. Let me know if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 There are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from OU that I will invite to the cookout at my house on Sunday, July 30th.  I asked Jody's opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest, and his answer was yes.  So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest.  I thought that I would also include Lexi Elliott, the recruiter from the Analyst Program that will be covering OU.  Have you decided on the make-up of the recruiting team at OU in the fall?  If so, this might be a good event in which to include them as well.  I left you a voice mail message about James Scribner as a potential good member of the team.  Let me know your thoughts and I can include anyone else that you would like.  I plan to get invitations out to everyone by July 7. 
 Thanks for including me.  Unfortunately, I will be out of town at an offsite meeting with the ENA management team from December 13 - 16.  --Sally 
 Since receiving your e:mail message last Monday on your needs in power, I have spent three (!!!) full days in PRC meetings since then.  I have shared your needs with both Todd Hall and Kristin Albrecht (my power business controller here in Houston) and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be of help.  Sorry that I keep missing your calls.  I will be meeting with Fernley, but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow. 
 It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week. 
 Let's book Friday, July 21 for this lunch.  I will work on further details. Thanks, Sharron. 
 Thanks for the input.  It is just in time -- I attend Rick Causey's cross functional PRC for Directors and above tomorrow.  I think that we have lunch coming up on the calendar on July 6.  I look forward to catching up then.  --Sally 
 I would like to invite you as University of Oklahoma summer interns to join me for lunch on Friday, June 30.   I have made reservations for 11:45 am at Nino's on West Dallas.   I hope that you will be able to attend and can meet me in the Enron lobby at 11:30.  We will provide transporation to and from lunch.  Please call me at x35926 as soon as possible to let me know if you can attend.  Mike McConnell, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks, will join us for lunch.  Many of you may have met Mike, a fellow OU grad.  He will serve as the Executive Lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at OU.  Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch.  James Scribner, a Senior Director in ENA Energy Operations, recently joined Enron after seven plus years with a Fortune 500 company in Edmond, Oklahoma.  James will be helping us with our OU recruiting efforts.  Lexi Elliott, a new recruiter with Enron's Associates and Analysts Program, will be coordinating Enron's recruiting efforts in the future at OU. 
 Thanks for the update.  I want to send her some flowers at the house.  Can you let Patti know if she is headed home on Friday?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 FYI - This came as a surprise to me.  Didn't know whether or not you knew about GInger's departure.  --Sally 
 UGH!!  I am happy for you, but know that Enron will be losing as you leave. I am pleased that the opportunity at Reliant is an exciting one for you, and I know that you will do a great job.  It has been fun to work with you, Ginger, and I too will miss that.  Best of luck to you!  --Sally 
 I know that Amanda will enjoy seeing you next week.  Thanks for making some time for her.  Let's definitely schedule a return trip for the two of you with some golf/cart time! 
 Looks as if this date will work for Mike McConnell and his wife, too.  I thought that I might also invite Ted Jacobs if he plans to be in  Houston that weekend.  Do you have an e:mail address for him?  Thanks. 
 Bruce,  Just a reminder, this Wednesday (Dec 13) is the Associate PRC meeting in which Sally will be representing Cheryl Ingstad.  She really needs your input in order to properly represent Cheryl.  Please email information to her ASAP or call Sally with information Tuesday between 9:00 - 9:30 AM (3:00 - 3:30 PM London time).  Thanks for your assistance, Patti x39106 
 I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case. The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time. 
 Thanks for the response.  I will look for your list so that I can send out invitations.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away from the desk is not very workable either.  After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery. Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this decision?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Enjoy the time off!  Just let us know when that week comes who your in charge person will be.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for the offer.  I will take you up on it.  Can you get a list of recent OU grads hired at Enron?  I have the list of summer interns from OU. I thought that I would invite both full time and summer interns to the cookout.  I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.  How does that date work for you?  I assume that summer interns will still be with us then.  What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?  David will of course be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for them.  We can make this work either way.   Do you think that people would prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.  I will take your suggestion on this one.  After you get me the list of OU full timers, I will combine it with the list that I have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete.  Thanks for the help.  --Sally 
 Bob is a good, solid player.  He won't change the world, but he is diligent about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with Brent.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 06/13/2000 03:47 PM 
 I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill.  Thanks in advance to your attention to this. 
 They all made me laugh out loud.  I am glad that they all were able to get up!  Thanks. 
 I am not close enough to know Bob's exact role within the group to know the impact of the prospect of losing him.  I am forwarding this to Brent to get his assessment of the impact.  I do know that the number of deals that we do currently has skyrocketed with EOL, so I feel sure that the group is stretched right now.  Again, though, Brent would best be able to address this.  As you are probably aware, I personnally made the commitment to Bob several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as needed at home for his wife.  For Bob's sake, I would want to make sure that he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated.  Thank you for contacting me first before going to Bob.  --Sally 
 Our mid year PRC meeting will be held Monday, June 19, at the Doubletree's Grainger "B" room.   Please plan to be there to start the meeting at 8:00 AM, with a continental breakfast available starting at 7:30.  We will take the time necessary to do a good job, but will also try to be time efficient. Patti has lunch and snacks ordered, so I would hope to be finished sometime in the afternoon.  I am broadening the Energy Operations PRC committee beyond my direct reports to also include all directors in the organization.  I look forward to everyone's participation and will be sending out more information later.  Included below are the attendees for the meeting.    PRC Attendees Energy Operations	HR 	Outside Kristin Albrecht	Sheila Walton	Wes Colwell - Business Analysis & Reporting Scott Earnest	Norma Villarreal	David Oxley - Human Resources Sheila Glover	Hector McLoughlin	Jim Bouillion - Global Risk Markets (Insurance) Todd Hall	Toni Graham	Brad Blesie - Global Risk Markets (Origination) Susan Harrison	Janet De La Paz (to run computer) Peggy Hedstrom Brenda Herod Steve Jackson Scott Mills Mike Moscoso Eugenio Perez Brent Price Leslie Reeves Stephen Schwarz James Scribner Mary Solmonson Bob Superty Sheri Thomas Steve Venturatos 
 This reporting tool looks very useful.  I am glad to know that you are managing with this on a regular basis.  Do we have a well-defined follow-up process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?  This is a great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.  It would be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this. Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are doing confirmations?  I would include Global Products as well.  --Sally 
 I think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions. Our meeting will take place on December 8th, so we can be ready to discuss promotion recommendations as early as Monday, December 11.  When would be a good time for you?  The invitation to attend our December 8th meeting still stands.  I know that it is along way to come for a single meeting (although it will most likely be a fully day), but if there are other things that you could accomplish while here, it could be worth it.  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office after noon on Friday, June 9, headed to the hill country to pick up one of my daughters from camp.  I will not attend the Friday afternoon meeting.  You will be able to reach me on my cell phone, 713-417-1591, as needed during the afternoon. 
 Approved.  Please process.  Thanks, Sally Beck 
 Hi, Mike.  It is almost 2 pm Houston time as I am reading your message, so my hope is that you have already headed home today.  I would love to visit with you.  Would it work for us to talk at 9 am (3 pm London time) on Friday? Another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office.  I would expect to be in my car from about 7:00 to 8:00 am (Houston time) tomorrow.  My car phone number is 713-417-1591.  A few weeks ago I put together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to Houston.  Once you have scheduled a trip, my offer still stands to set up these meetings for you.  It may be easier for my assistant to coordate these things in Houston than for you assistant to attempt that from London, given the time difference.  I will look forward to speaking with you.  I understand that your value in the office is already felt.  --Sally 
 Buried with Shankman today.  I will e:mail you tomorrow. 
 Thanks for the info on your trip.  Have a great time -- I will be anxious to hear about the presentation in Natchez.  Love, Sally 
 I meant to send this to you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for confirming Mark's participation.  Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, will be sending information to your attention on the following:  Specifics on location of meeting at Rice Hotel Attendee list (names, titles, operating companies) Brief background on Mary Solmonson's Global Database Management Group Suggested  talking points for Mark's talk Agenda for the meeting  We will be sure to get this informaiton to you by Friday of this week, so that you can provide Mark with a copy when he is in the London office on Monday.  Thanks for your help--Sally 
 We will look forward to seeing you on the 17th.  Glad we could work out a date. 
 I left a voice mail message for Dave Delainey this morning asking for clarification around the LNG business.  As soon as I hear back from him I will let you know, and then based on that info we can decide on best next steps. 
 I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in Energy Operations.  Analysts  Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams  Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add more  strength to this group  Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to a trading  role, if appropriate   Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work experience and fit)  Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a direct hire  Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience   Associates  Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group  Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from Energy Operations interviewed him or her)  Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations   Let me know about next steps in this process.  I would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth. 
 I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they also have data in to Sally by Thursday.  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis.  Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as well. 
 Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business. (This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with Jeff on this? 
 We willl consider that a rain check.  Just let know in a cooler month when you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to play.  Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in Calgary the last time.  If you have a few minutes amidst the SAP training while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from your perspective how your interactions with my Houston operations group are going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement.  Just give me a call at x35926.  --Sally 
 We have lunch scheduled for June 22, according to my calendar.  I am looking forward to it.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.  I had put her on the list of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has been as involved with EOL.  --Sally 
 I didn't know about this one.  I'm going to follow up with Brent on this one and I will get back to you in a day or so.  We'll save the Scott Mills discussion for a later date!  On another note, I enjoyed lunch today.  Let me know when you want to get out of the building again sometime.  --Sally 
 My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project, Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity. 
 Please pring attached presentation for me in color.  Thanks. 
 I did walk out of the room with the two booklets (employee profiles and pre-review rankings) that had been distributed, and I left a message with Sheila Knudsen as soon as I got back to my office on Wednesday night to let her know.  They were delivered to Sheila on Thursday morning.  Can you verify that Sheila received those from me?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.  I apologize if I seemed impatient in the meeting.  I know that you are working for the best interests of Energy Operations and  Enron.  By the end of the day I was probably looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend itself well to that.  Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to talk separate from immediate issues at hand?  I will have Patti get a date on the calendar.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.  Kristin certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half of the year.  I would like to see her develop a broader view across the organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.  I guess that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 06:21 PM 
 I have entered the following names into the Performance Review System as suggested reviewers:  Commercial Customers  Jeff Shankman Jim Fallon Gary Hickerson   Direct Reports  Brent Price (Business Controller -Natural Gas) Kristin Albrecht (Business Controller - Power) Todd Hall (Business Controller - Merchant Portfolio)   Others  Rick Causey Ted Murphy Fernley Dyson (London) 
 Happy anniversary!  I hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call you to wish you that over the phone on my way home.  Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a total for gifts for both girls.  Love, Sally 
 Scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is in the London office now is Brent Price.  I looked up Scott's name on our Enron People Finder, and it would appear that he is in the IT department.  I assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the UK, so I would suggest that you contact Beth Perlman in Houston who leads IT for ENA or talk with Mark Pickering in IT in London.  My role in Houston is over the trading operations groups, but does not include IT.  I wish that I could answer your specific question for you, but I think that referring you to IT will get you the answer that you need. 
 Ditto. 
 I assume that granting access for someone for whom Lorraine Becker is the supervisor should be approved by you.  I get hundreds of these, many for employees outside Energy Operations.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Please print for me on legal size paper.  Thanks. 
 Per my voice mail...somehow my intent to copy you on this didn't work. Shona's extension is 39123 and she is sitting on the 30th floor.  --Sally 
 I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be good for to consider hiring.  Here is her response.  Tony Vasut had called her and asked for this list as well.  Do you have him keyed in on our blitz effort for hiring of risk personnel?  Or is he working on some other initiative?  I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.  --Sally 
 FYI - I believe that Shona will prove to be a great asset to Enron.  We are following up on her leads for talent.  --Sally 
 I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time. Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the new role.  I think that it will be an interesting challenge and that you will do a great job.  How soon do you start?  --Sally 
 I have signed up for June 1st.  There is no indication on the e:mail that you forwarded of the location for the focus group.  I assume that more details will follow. 
 I have this on my calendar for September 7 and I am looking forward to it. Thanks. 
 Hi Ted,  It's Patti.  An all day meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 31 - the day you and Sally were scheduled for lunch.  Any possibility of rescheduling to another day?  Sally is available Thursday, June 1.  Just let me know.  Thanks, Patti 
 My new employee who will be working with me on global standards for operations for all trading/origination locations started with Enron yesterday.  Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.  She was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30 to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is one.   I will have her contact you later today.  Although she is new to Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the US and in Europe.  She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.   --Sally 
 I will be out of the office for one vacation day on Monday, May 22.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, has home and cell phone numbers where I can be reached throughout the day, if needed.  Primary operations contacts while I am out are as follows:  DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960  Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962  Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, May 23. 
 According to records from the Analysts Program, the following interns will be working within Energy Operations during the summer.  The assignment stated below is as reflected in the program's spreadsheet.  Name   School   Start Date Assignment  Luna Carlson  University of Florida  July 5  ENA - Risk Reporting and Analysis  Joshua Koenig  University of Florida  May 22  Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management  Jolly Jose  University of Houston  June 5   Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management  Michael Taylor  LSU    May 22  Central Desk Logistics  Daniel Graham  Morehouse   May 15  ENA - Financial Settlements  Angelique Woods University of Texas  May 22  ENA - Risk Management    First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made for desk, phone and computers for all.  Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to Enron.  Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you. 
 FYI  -- Let me know who Angelic will report to and what she will be doing. Thanks. 
 Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally 
 I agree that discussing the numbers in person with AA would be the right way to handle this.  And, I am looking to Brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting.  My expectation is that the vast majority of the $49MM variance will be explained and finalized by Monday at 11:00 am.  This finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.  I will be on vacation on Monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but I have carved out time during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation, as it is very important to me.  --Sally 
 I will be attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting on December 7th.  It starts at 8:00 and may not take the entire day.  I will talk with Wes and see what he anticipates for timing to let you know if it makes sense to schedule me to interview.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Mary,  Sally says this is okay.  Patti 
 Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday.  I am glad that you are eager to get together to kick off your role -- we will have to save that for Tuesday, however.  I am taking the day off on Monday to be with my parents who will be in from Austin for one of my daughter's piano recital.  9:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday would be a great time for us to get together.  There are two other meetings that day that I would like to have you attend with me.  One is a weekly Risk Forum luncheon from 11:30 to 1:00 and the other is a meeting at 3:00 on trading operations for Tokyo.  I will give the details on location and list of attendees when you and I meet on Tuesday morning.  Enjoy your next few days.  I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday. Check with my assistant, Patti Thompson, on where you will be sitting.   I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  --Sally 
 Tara,  Sally says Todd's London project is under Barry Pearce (related to Continental Power) - Barry would need to designate London RC (or James New in his absence, since Barry is in Houston).  Regarding the "extra" housing costs, this would need to be charged to Todd's RC in Houston, which is #2182.  Please let me know if you require additional information.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Approved.  Please process. Sally Beck 
 Thanks for the update and attachment.  It will be great to have you back here in Houston.  I have heard lots of good things about your assignment there, however, so I know that the London group will miss your presence.  I will try to call you Wednesday morning on my way into the office.  I. 
 Sally has changed the time of her Thursday morning meeting to 8:30 - 10:30 AM (previously scheduled 8:00 - 10:00 AM).  Please let me know if you can't make this new time.  Topic for meeting:  information from her ENA Executive Offsite and also a brainstorming session.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Thanks for the reminders.  Hopefully, this will take care of this. 
 Sorry this took so long...  Sally says put her on our Co #413, RC # 0813 for now.  Also, she would like Angelique's resume as soon as possible.  Sally is in Calgary but she asked me to fax it to her as soon as I get it, so tomorrow would be great.  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Irena,  Can you attach file?  Patti    Enron North America Corp. 
 Mary,  As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison as a signer.  Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume Management groups.  This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.  Thanks, Sally 
 Ted,  I checked with Sally and she says Wednesday, May 31 is good for lunch & she looks forward to seeing you.  Patti 
 Fernley,  Sally asked me to forward this to you to outline what she is doing with Arthur Anderson to get ready for SAP, specifically, Global Products.  Patti 
 Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management operations initiatives.  I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary to get your input on his role to date. 
 Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA.  I didn't realize that when I said hello in the elevator last week that we would be seeing more of you in Houston.  I look forward to working with you when you arrive. 
 Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer.    Your leadership in ENA was appreciated and I will miss your active participation in ENA's business.  However, I hope that we will have opportunities to work together in the future.  --Sally 
 This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource.   Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.  Let me know how I can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined.  I was impressed with my brief glimpse of Jeff at yesterday's 5:30 meeting.  --Sally 
 Well done!  Beth will be a great resource.  --Sally 
 I will be in the Calgary office from Wednesday afternoon, May 10 through noon on Friday, May 12.  I can most easily be reached through Peggy Hedstrom, whose phone via tie line is 820-6753.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, has a copy of my itinerary and phone and fax numbers at my hotel, if needed.  Primary operations contacts in Houston while I am in Calgary are as follows:  DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960  Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962  Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210 
 Laura,  I am attaching resume of Mark Mixon that Sally left you a voicemail regarding on Monday.  If you are going to be in town and would like to see Mark, please let me know and I would be happy to make arrangements.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 Sally's Assistant 
 I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear Julie Andrews speak.   Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as our daughters.  So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High School with Meagan.  Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.  I hope that all of you enjoy the evening.  The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next Tuesday, May 16.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot for dinner.   That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.  I can't think of a better idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, motivated women!     I will look forward to introducing her to those of you whom she has not yet met. 
 I have been summoned for jury duty onTuesday, November 28 at 8:00 am.  While wanting to fulfill my civic duty, I am also hoping to be an unlikely juror this time around so that I can be back in the office sometime on Tuesday.  I will call in and let Patti know my status. 
 I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this afternoon.   I have left a message for Bryce and I will get with him on Tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message after that.  --Sally 
 Below is the name and phone number of the woman that I worked with to arrange our tour of Enron  Field.  She may not be the person to talk with regarding displaying a boat, but  will very likely be able to give the correct contact.  It was nice to meet you.  I have enjoyed getting to know Bethany through NCL.  Good luck!    Jill McCormick  713-259-8965 
 I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's name was "in play", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead. Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would like.  His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".  He and Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.  Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates. 
 Please print the attachment for me in color.  Maybe three copies.  Thanks. 
 Stephen joined Enron on January 29, 1996.  Is there any other info that you need?  Are you still planning to be in Houston next week? --Sally 
 He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.  He reports to Scott Mills, who is the user lead for the project.  I am copying Scott on this message, as his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the horizon and how critical Tom's involvement is to those deliverables.  I suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions.  --Sally 
 You have the right earrings -- they are tiny!  But that's what she would like.  She will be really pleased.  She loves her silver ones, but they are not great for everyday wear -- gold is better for her ears.  Sounds as if your weekend was fun.  Ours was nice --errands and stuff on Saturday and the Enron picnic at Astroworld on Sunday.  Otherwise, just camping out in the mess at our house.  I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist. Sounds as if from her ER buddy at the Heart Hospital that she has decided that they need both -- one for counseling and one for meds.  I believe that she and Dad will each see a counselor type on Tuesday this week.  I hope that they will begin to find some relief.  Sounds as if they are really having a hard time - at least Mom.  We would still like for you to come visit.  Let's talk dates when you're ready.  --Sally 
 FYI - Let's talk.  I am already booked for Tuesday AM - could you attend and would you want to?  Let's talk before getting back to Margaret.  --Sally 
 FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally 
 Thanks for the heads up.  I get so many of these requests and never can tell what is being requested!  Your note made this one fast and easy to handle. Thanks. 
 I understand that Ashley Worthing has been hired by Enron to start work this summer.  I think that she is graduating from Texas A&M.  She is my cousin's daughter, so I am just curious whether or not she is coming in as an analyst.  Please let me know if that is the case.  Thanks. 
 I gave a copy of this document to Wes Colwell immediately following last week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you.  He is the most appropriate respondent from ENA.  --Sally 
 Did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail ?  There was not one attached. 
 Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town. Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally 
 Glad you sent a note - as crazy as life is at our house right now, I did not get the message from Tammy.  Lots of catch up in the office last week, which will continue this week.  I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.  We are starting to talk birthday with Meagan now.  I will get back with you in a couple of days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.  Thanks for asking. --Sally 
 Hi Clare,  How about:  Tuesday, May 9th 1:30-2:30 PM or 3:00-4:00 PM  Sally has tentative plans to go to Calgary May 10-12, so Tuesday is best for her.  If neither of these time slots work, just let me know and I can move things around to accommodate James.  See ya, Patti 
 Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition:  Example:  Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that is clarified. 
 Barbara,  Will this be at 4:00 PM on Monday?  Sally has meeting w/ Louise Kitchen from 3:30 to 4:30, so she will probably be 30 mins late to Jeff's meeting.  Patti 
 It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure time.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.  I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.  My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like a very long ten day stay.  He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight! Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health for him going forward.  Thanks for asking.  --Sally 
 She was Superior - top of the table.  Her written review should be in the file.  Let me know if HR can not produce that for you and I can get you a copy.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 12:46 PM 
 Tara,  When I tried to approve this request (Sheri gave verbal approval), I got message that it had already been approved by another access approver.  Patti x39106 
 Thanks for your note.  Between meetings today, I will construct a loose job description and e:mail that to you later today.  I realized after you left that we did not talk about compensation.  It would help me in creating this role with our HR group if I knew ballpark figures on compensation.  We have a good comp team that can research that for me, but a short cut would be to know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking for  in making a move.  Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail.  My number is 713-853-5926.  --Sally 
 I would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first Gas Ops program. Keep me posted on date and time.  Thanks for attending the meeting yesterday.  I hope that you will let me know when and how I can best be involved and provide support for your efforts.  --Sally 
 You have a ticket - we will see you there, with you pager on!  Patti will get your ticket to you before Thursday. 
 Do you want to give your tickets to someone in your group and join the management team?  Up to you...    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sounds interesting, and Scottsdale is supposed to be nice.  Enjoy! 
 Sounds like a good idea.  I am glad to Theresa is getting some benefit from the program.  --Sally 
 Sheila,  I'm sorry I haven't responded to this before, but Sally has been out of the office with family illness & I haven't been able to check with her.  I will be out of the office until Tuesday, so if you need this information before then, please call Chantelle Villanueva at ext.36279 on Monday and she can check with Sally then.  Thanks, Patti 
 Joe,  Sally is out of the office, but wanted me to forward the message that she had reviewed the draft that you put together regarding power trading and she doesn't have any comments.  Patti x-39106 
 Approved.  Sally Beck 
 Here it is! 
 I have this on my calendar.  I have jury duty on Tuesday starting at 8:00 am.  I hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as I can.    So I should be able to make the meeting at 4:00.  I will call you if I get hung up at the court house.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.  I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following:  Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU  Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida  Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of Florida  Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU  Carolyn Barrett  EBS  Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P   Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus.  SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May.  Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or communication about the program.   We hear rumors of "tracks", but no facts or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some had not.  Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.  Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.   Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:  Disc 
 Kim,  Sally says that Wes Colwell will be assigning ENA representative.  Patti x39106 
 I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.  Below are my suggested seven appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.  I made the selections based on their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.  I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today.   Analyst  School  Current Rotation Rationale  Ilan Caplan  UT   CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations  Erin Rice  Trinity   CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the solution; female minority  Brian Hoskins  Vanderbilt  ENA Trading  I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one  Carrie Southard  Texas A&M  ENA - EOL  Current MSA rotation  Alejandro Veiga Rice   ESA - Venezula  Good ideas; diverse background  Courtney Votaw  Pepperdine  Corp. - PR  Adds interest to the mix with her rotation & background  Adrian Woolcock Rice   EES   Sounds mature; good ideas 
 Approved. Sally Beck 
 I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.  However, in my staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for EOL access.  We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.  Susan needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager should  okay this as well.  --Sally 
 Please incorporate these changes into the 2000 plan.  Thanks. 
 We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all be glad to see you.  I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it. And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  Love, Sally 
 I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office. Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, however!  I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can easily step out to talk with you. 
 Please incorporate the management contact changes per Sheila Glover for the 2000 plan. 
 Can you coordinate the Scott Tholen's team to do this ASAP?  Thanks.  Keep me updated on when Fernley will have access.  Thanks. 
 Approved. Sally Beck  System would not allow me to submit request electronically. 
 Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get together.  Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.  When that is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.  Hope your weekend was a good one.  Have you seen Brent yet?  --Sally 
 Willie Harrell Security Request approved. Sally Beck 
 Fall sounds good to me.  In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 The scholarships, while sponsored by Enron, are technically awarded by UT.  I will be talking with Sue White today, and I will get her take on whether or not the university wants to contact the winners or whether Enron should do it.  I will let you know.  The 24th is a great day for me for the dinner in Austin.  So if that works for recepients and faculty, then that would work our well.  Keep me posted. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have asked Patti to get us together  to discuss your e:mail message as soon as possible.  Hopefully, we can work that out this week.  I llok forward to talking with you and I will be glad to help you in any way that I can. 
 Energy Operations will enjoy participating in this program.  I would like to bring this us up at my staff meeting on Monday, April 10, so I will get back to you with the number of students and the contact person(s) next week. --Sally     Susan Skarness 03/31/2000 04:37 PM 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.  The field will make baseball much more fun in Houston. 
 I already have this date on my calendar.  Count me in.  --Sally 
 We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue. However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official notification from the University takes place.  Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she would like to be included if her schedule permits.  Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me know how I can help with these arrangements.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for sending the announcement to me.  You will be a great asset to EBS.  And you will probably be working with some of our old Energy Operations staff members!  Stay in touch and I wish you the best in your new role. --Sally 
 I will look forward to meeting you during your visit to Houston next week.  I will work with Carol to schedule a time that will work for both of us.  Have a nice flight.  --Sally 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.   It was certainly a panoramic view from up there!  I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to Enron, and I am  certainly glad that you are here.

 Glad you enjoyed the game.  That was quite a climb to those seats!  I did it a couple of times with my two year old in arms, and wasn't sure that I would make it!  That's good that you could watch from a lower level. --Sally 
 Per my voice mail message, attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in London.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Fernley and I plan to send this out sometime next week, prior to Brent's assignment starting on April 10. 
 Do you know what this is?   ISO makes me think power.  Any clues?  --Sally 
 Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this season.  One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is two tickets in the terrace level.  I have also purchased one parking spot in a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.  I have divided the tickets among you, with my husband's help.  He identified "good games" (i.e. teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across my direct reports.  Tickets for the other games have been distributed based your percentage of Energy Operations employees.  For most games, you will receive all six tickets.  You can use these tickets for yourself and for a small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.  The parking information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.  Patti is including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.  Your tickets will be distributed to you this week.  I hope that you and your staff will enjoy these.  I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.  I have chosen to distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy Operations who are not my direct reports.  SInce you will have first call on the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.  I wanted to make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.  Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a weekday afternoon and one a weekend.  I will let you know these dates soon, as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games. 
 Approved.  Please note that Co. # should be 0342 for Misc. Expense on Todd032400LondonSAP expense report. Thanks, Sally Beck

 Sorry, I can;t help you on this one.  I don't have a copy.  --Sally 
 Meant to copy you on this reply to Mike, but forgot to do so before my initial send.  Here it is... 
 I will be at the meeting on Thursday.  I have asked Brenda Herod to attend as well.  Can you add her to your distribution list so that she receives notice of these meetings as well?  That way, one or both of us will be able to attend.  Thanks. 
 I will plan to attend.  Can you attend as well?  --Sally 
 Definitely take off and meet Scott at the airport.  I know that you will be glad to see him.    Enron North America Corp.

 I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use this.  Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you. 
  Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies in which Enron holds an ownership interest.   Attached is a copy of that schedule.  Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.  You will note that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.  We have identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA. 
 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591). I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once or twice a day.  I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London around 1 AM Houston time).  I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27. 
 The e:mail system never recognizes Rick Causey, so you were dropped from the first distribution.  I have to remember to type your full first name! 
 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday this week (March 15-17).   I will be with my children while they are on Spring Break.  I can be reached those three day either at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).   The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the office while I am out: Key Operations Contacts March 15-17  Brent Price   Business Controller, Gas  x37647  Kristin Albrecht   Business Controller, Power  x34763  Also, I will be in the London office during the week of March 20th.  I am working with Fernley Dyson and John Sherriff to structure training and orientation for a new head of trading operations that has been hired in London.  I am also working to provide transition resources to London for operational controls unttil the new guy is on board.  My work on this should be completed by the end of next week.  I will return to Houston on Friday, March 24.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106),  will have a copy of my schedule while I am in London as well as an international mobile phone number where I can be reached. Please don't hesitate to call.  I will be responding to voice mail messages throughout the week.   The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the Houston office while I am working from London:  Key Operations Contacts  March 20-24  Brenda Herod   Business Controller, Gas  x35778  Kristin Albrecht   Business Controller, Power  x34763  Kristin Albrecht will attend the Monday, March 20th staff meeting at 9:30 in my absence. 
 I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.    -Sally 
 Per my earlier e:mail message, I am forwarding to you the draft of the report on the operations/controls review of Singapore.  (It is an attachment to the message from Scott Earnest to me.)  The most current drafts of the reports on Oslo and  Frankfurt were compiled by the AA team in London.  Nick Swingler is apparently out on vacation this week.  I have asked AA personnel from Houston to coordinate with their London office to get you a copy of those two draft reports.  Given the time difference, you should receive thos reports via e:mail from AA on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 I'll look forward to seeing you.  Since my first note, I have scheduled a dinner with Richard Sage on Thursday evening - the only time that he and I can meet, since he is in Helsinki through Wednesday, in the office on Thursday but booked that day.  With the Tuesday dinner with Fernley, that leaves Monday or Wednesday.  I hope that one of those days works for you and Frank.  I will try to call Mo - I think that she is still in Houston today. --Sally 
 1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive those drafts today.  2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am there.  3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are the following:  Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide for you during this transition period Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of the details on having support personnel in London  Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one (which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)  Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective trading operations and controls world-wide  I look forward to seeing you next week. 
 Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible.  Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week. It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London. I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed.  I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids. The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April.  Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them. 
 I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to Houston next week.  My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it looks as if we will miss one another.  My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  I will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, with effective exception reporting.  This is a key initiative for 2000 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities. 
 I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next week and I had asked her to arrange  a lunch with you and Brent, plus some time for just the two of us to get together.  We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally 
 Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.  Wanted to see if you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.  We arrive on Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning. Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.  But Monday, Wednesday and Thursday are available.  Does it work for you with the baby to do evenings?  Let me know. 
 Have fun in San Antonio.   It is a very popular spring break destination. Enjoy it! 
 3PM sounds great.  I will look forward to meeting you. 
 We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations.  I view this as a business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.  ENA is picking up the cost associated with the family.  Sounds as if I need to make sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that handled.  That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those days., both evening games.  I would be happy to give you four tickets for either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 10th or the 12th.  We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying through Thursday, so we should see one another before April.  I am working on an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there.  --Sally 
 Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these meetings if you would like to do so.  The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your homework on this.  We will definitely take a look at these two places next week while we are in London.  Let us know what we need to do to schedule this.  I look forward to meeting you.  One of your earlier messages suggested meeting on Monday morning.  Monday is great, but we would have to make that an afternoon meeting.  Brent and I will be on the flight that leaves Houston at 7:00 PM on Sunday evening, arriving at Gatwick around 10:00 AM.  By the time we clear customs, take the train, check in to the hotel and shower, we will not be in the office before 12:30 or 1:00.  Do you have a time available to meet with us that afternoon?   Thanks.  --Sally 
 Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might interest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate. If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral along to other HR groups.  FYI - James will start work here on April 3.

 FYI - This should make things easier in London as there will be one point person to focus on global.  I am not sure that her background will bring a lot to the table in the early stages, but she did seem sharp when I met with her last week.  This announcement did surprise me a bit, as when I last talked with Fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing Tani in this role.  ---Sally 
 Kevin Sweeney forwarded this message to me.  Fernley may have made you aware of his decision with Tani when you and he talked yesterday.  If not, I thought that you might be interested in this.  --Sally

 Approved. Sally Beck 
 Am just back from Disneyworld (Tyler loved it, so you will have a great time in a few weeks) today, and I did get your message.  I will talk with Kristin this afternoon.  I agree that Edith would be great.  I will let you know if there is someone else that we can make available if Edith doesn't work.  I will leave you a message tonight before I go on status.  --Sally 
 Please print 3 copies for me in color.  Thanks. 
 I would definitely talk with Wes Colwell about doing the presentation on Business Analysis & Reporting.  I think that he would do a great job! 
 The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott Tholen's team to my operations team.   (This makes a lot of sense, since it is our group that prepares all of these reports.)  Fernley Dyson has requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.  In insuring a tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access to the Enron-wide DPR.  Thanks.

I do not plan on checking messages, so if something critical comes up, please leave me a message at the hotel.  We are there with the Klein High School Bearkadettes, in case you need to know that to get a message to me. 
 Thanks for making the arrangements in Boerne!  It's interesting to know that the mustard men are real and not just a made up story for tourists. I am glad that I avoided them! 
 I will be out of the office on vacation on Thursday, Friday and Monday, March 2, 3, and 6th.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) will have telephone and fax numbers for the hotel where I will be staying.  I will be at Disneyworld with my family and 90 members of my daughter's high school drill team, so it is not likely that I will be available during the daytime.  However, I can be contacted at the hotel in the evening, if needed.  While I am out, please contact the following for any operational needs:  Brent Price   Business Controller for Natural Gas  x37647  Kristin Albrecht *   Business Controller for Power   x34763   *  Kristin will be in the office in the morning only on March 6: she will be in route to Portland in the afternoon.   I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 7. 
 Rick:  Sorry, I should have sent this to you several days ago.  Is the level of detail correct on these goals as you look to assimilate these with others?  I have stated the goals, but not the action plan to achieve the goals.  I am working on those in some detail right now.   --Sally      Goals for 2000 Global Risk Management Operations   I.  Build/Enhance Operational and Controls Infrastructure to Support:  A.  Merchant Activities  Japan Southern Cone Continental Europe Other regions as identified  B.  Emerging Businesses/Products  Enron Broadband Services Credit Trading Other products as identified  C.  Joint Ventures   II.  Strengthen Mid and Back Office Talent and Controls for Global Risk Management Operations  A.  Establish common operational standards,with effective exception reporting  B.   Strengthen and support the controls mindset in key operational personnel  C.  Develop a plan to identify, develop and provide rotational opportunities to key operations employees  D.  Continue to coordinate with IT to develop mid and back office systems that allow for timely and accurate compilation of data across  systems for risk and business reporting 
 Was it not January when we were back and forth and back and forth to London/Helsinki?  And despite the fact that the date sequence from London looks funny, it would seem that Nigel on the 17th of February is talking about beginning the process (actually debating the process) of background checks? 
 With my recent travel, I am days (maybe weeks) behind on e:mail.  I didn't see my name on the attachment.  Do I have access to this? 
 Please print a color copy for me of the two attachments to Kate's memo. Thanks. 
 Is this what you have from AA as a format/information that they are comfortable with?  --Sally 
 Ted Murphy and I met with the Arther Andersen team this morning that accompanied us on our trip to Buenos Aires.  We reviewed the observations and recommendations in written form that we had discussed briefly with you on our last day your office.  After making a few changes, AA should be forwarding to you a copy of the draft document later this afternoon.   We would welcome your comments and your additions on anything that you think we may have missed.  Ted and I will be meeting with Rick Causey and Rick Buy within the next couple of days to discuss our operations and control review, so your responses would be welcomed prior to that meeting.  I look forward to working with you and others in your office in my role over Global Risk Management Operations.  In addition to overseeing common standards and controls for opeartional practices, I will work as your advocate for system and resource needs in order to insure success for your business plan in Buenos Aires. 
 Ted Murphy and I met this morning with the Arthur Andersen team that accompanied us to Sao Paulo.  We reviewed a summary of our observations and recommendations as a result of our visit.  After a few suggested changes, AA should forward a copy of this draft to you via e:mail later today.  We would welcome your comments on the document, and input on anything that you think we may have missed.  Ted and I will be reviewing this information with Rick Buy and Rick Causey as soon as a meeting can be scheduled, so your prompt comments or feedback would be welcomed. 
 My travel lately has not allowed time to interview.  Gretchen Jennings in HR is supposed to be setting up interviews with appropriate candidates for me. She has a stack of all of the resumes that either I have received or those that responded to the posting.  I hope to start interviewing next week, although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday.  Feel free to move forward with whatever you need to do.  I trust that I will have several good candidates to consider, and Patti is doing a great job, also.  I need to find out if she would like to  be considered for the fulltime position. 
 Peggy Hedstrom will be out of the office from March 1 - 11 for vacation. Our spring break week is March 13, so I have sent Peggy a note asking about sometime the week of March 20 or 27.  I will let you know her reply and then I would love to do a joint trip! 
 I have not been able to schedule a review with Peggy yet, as I am still trying to schedule a trip to Calgary so that Peggy and I can do her review. She will be out of town from March 1 through March 11, so I will have to come to Calgary sometime after March 11.  I was in South America last week, and have been to London and Helsinki twice since mid-January, so scheduling reviews is a challenge this time around.  I will certainly get you a signed copy of the review as soon as I can. 
 Clare,  Barry left me voicemail saying 1:30-2:30 pm would probably be okay - I will tentatively put that in Sally's calendar.  We can change later if need be.  Thanks, Patti 
 Barry, Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.  A lot of people will be tied up all day Feb 29 at this offsite.  She would, however, like to set up time to meet with you in Houston on Wednesday, March 1.  Sally is available from 1:30 - 5:00 in the afternoon.  Please let me know if there is a one hour slot that will work for you.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 (Sally's Assistant) 
 Ted,  Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.  Patti 
 Another FAS 133 Offsite meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, Feb 29 (all day).  Sally asked me to forward this to you - would like you to attend if at all possible.  Scott, this is an FYI for you - I know you will be overseas on this date.  Patti 
 Sally asked me to forward this to you.  Patti 
 Thanks for this info.  I will call the students this week.  With your notes, it looks as if we may be on target in terms of acceptances and the desired number of 6.  Keep me posted on what we hear from the students.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Paige,  Sheila Glover and Scott Earnest will be attending for Sally.  Mike Moscoso is out of town.  Patti 
 Mike & Scott,  Sally asked me to forward this to you & wanted to know if there was any way possible you could attend. I apologize for the short notice, but with Sally going out of the country, things have been really hectic.   Sheila Glover will also be attending.  Please let me know as soon as possible & I will let Paige know.  Thanks, Patti x 39106 
 Kent,  Please forward this to Sally Beck.  Thanks, Patti 
 I have asked Patti to send Sharron a list of all employees within Energy Operations (a BIG list) and another one with managers and above (perhaps a more manageable list) for this effort.  Since you went to the meeting I didn't know whether or not you were following up on this.  Just wanted to let you know that I have asked Patti to do this.  Thanks. 
 I think that this was great, too.  I look forward to the next one.  Would you like to coordinate dinner plans for the next lecture? 
 Approved.  Please process. Thanks, Sally Beck 
 FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having their names included twice in promotional memos!  Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary. 
 I won't be able to join Wanda and Juanita in Calgary next week.  I will find myself in South America next week, in Sao Paolo and Buenos Aires.  Should be interesting, but a long flight.  I am cross referencing my calendar with your vacation days, and I will get back with you later today on a suggested date for a trip north. 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is very well deserved.  I follow your career within Enron with interest. 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director.  That makes all of the life juggling seem a little more worthwhile, doesn't it?! 
 Thanks for the resume.  She has had some good experience.  Do you know much about her performance here at Enron?  Can I call and talk with her directly? I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is very well deserved.  You do an amazing job of balancing children and work, and contributing so much on your work on 133. 
 Please print a color copy of this for me.  Thanks. 
 Friday at 2:00 pm  --does that work for you?  --Sally 
 Thanks for keeping me posted on this.  Do let me know if there are further problems. 
 Friday won't work for me for lunch this week, but Thursday is open for me at this point.  Would that day work for you?  If lunch won't work, then we will plan some time on the calendar for Thursday or Friday.  Let me know.   I will look forward to seeing you. 
 The draft of the memo looks good.  However, your memo says that the memo will be sent to all US employees of ENA.  ENA by definition includes Canada and Mexico.  Therefore, please send the memo to all ENA employees, not just those in the US.  Several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in our Calgary office, so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees in Calgary.  I am at x35926 if you have any questions. 
 Please distribute attached memo to all Enron North America employees.  If you need additional information, please call my assistant, Patti Thompson at ext. 39106.  Thank you, Sally Beck Vice President of Energy Operations 
 This made it!  We are still waiting today to find out if we can get a Visa today.  If so, I will be on the way to South America on Sunday evening.  If Chris' associate has any recommendations, I would love to hear them. Thanks.  --Sally 
 It does work!  We enjoyed seeing you, also.  Thanks for letting us crash temporarily at your house. 
 Brent & Peggy,  Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions. Sally made a beginning stab at it, but would like you to read over your segment and make any corrections or additions that you see fit (Peggy, in your case, can you fill in the blank).  When these are received back from you, I will call her (if it's this afternoon), and final copy will be distributed.  Thanks for your help.  Patti x39106 
 How about our resources?   Is there someone working on Entelligence now for us that could at least temporarily be redirected to work on updating GCP appropriately? 
 Thanks  -- definitely not too late.  --Sally 
 Approved.  Please process. Thanks, Sally Beck 
 The attachment on Ted's memo contains the list of students who will attend the luncheon tomorrow.  Thanks again for doing this! --Sally 
 I will be attending a funeral in Austin on Thursday.  I can be reached on my cell phone (713-417-1951) in the morning and afternoon while driving to and from Austin.  If you need immediate information and I can not be reached on my cell phone, please contact Brent Price at x37647.  I will be back in the office on Friday. 
 FYI...Thanks for going.  --Sally 
 Approved.  Please process.  Thanks. Sally Beck 
 David, Can you resend 1/26/00 MPR?  I mistakingly deleted file before all worksheets were printed.  Thanks, Patti (Sally's assistant) 
 Please join us for a celebration of Energy Operations promotions, hosted by ENA Energy Operations Management Team.  The following people will be honored at Irma's (22 N.

Directions will be available Monday at Patti's desk (3012f). Hope to see you there! 
 I can not attend as I will be in the London office for the remainder of the week.  Hope that all is well with you.  We will have to catch up soon. 
 Please forward to James Scribner.  He will call with his e:mail address. = =20 
 Thanks for your note!  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office on Tuesday, so have a great time without me. Have a great Thanksgiving. --Sally 
 Thanks for forwarding mail to me.  I apologize for the inconvenience of this.  My current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com, as suggested within the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long name.   HOWEVER, my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com. That was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation I am sure.  When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.  So I can see why you would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated guess on the address or referencing my old card.  SInce there are at least 2 sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between us?   That might help eliminate confusion going forward. 
 Thanks for the note.  While most of my focus will be on ENA, it will be interesting to look at operations around the world. 
 Please find out location of this conference call and put the details on my calendar.  Thanks. -- Sally 
 Please put my name on the list to attend this forum on Wednesday, January 26.  Thanks. 
 Thanks-- I think! 
 I always have time for lunch!  I will ask my assistant to call you to set something up.  Thanks for your note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the note.  I am glad that you are enjoying Portland.  I am still on the 30th floor, so do drop by sometime when you are in town.  I would love to see you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the note.  I hope that you are enjoying your role in EES. 
 Thanks -- I now know that you read notes mail messages very promptly! --Sally 
 Thanks for the note, Sherri.  I know that you read notes mail messages very promptly!  --Sally 
 I am out of the office all day on Wednesday. --Sally 
 Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.  This memo will be sent by Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the organization. 
 It is officially on the way!  We will see how long it takes to get=20 distributed.  --Sally=20 
 I liked the new signs for the new hire network this morning, as opposed to the signs for new hire orientation.  Just wanted to let you know that I noticed the difference!  I will be curious to hear about changes to the content as well.  Hope your are doing well.  We will have to have lunch after you get through January!  --Sally 
 This is the most immediate response that I have ever gotten on notes mail! Just let me know and I will be there.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the note about the video conference.  I have put that date on my calendar and I am very interested in the discussion.  Any details on where I need to go in Houston to join in?  --Sally 
 Please take these meetings off my calendar.  Thanks! 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is wonderful to see your contributions recognized in that way!  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your new role in the communciations company.  Building that business will be exciting and how great for the company that you will be there! 
 Attached is a memo that Rick plans to send out - I hope that attaching this makes it easy for you to take care of this.  I am delivering to him a highlighted copy of the memo so that he will know about a few wording changes that I have made since the last time that he saw this in draft form.  He is certainly free to make any other changes before it goes out.  Call me with any questions. 
 John and I haven't talked about this need, but I will certainly think about any likely candidates.  Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & Documentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.  He was knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book administrator in a previous life.  Have you considered him?  Give me a couple of days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get back with you.  --Sally 
 Could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as Hess?  You will have to explain to me what the issue was.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 This includes OU and UT -- you can ignore the OU names, but there are some good students that I can introduce you to when they arrive! 
 Cecilia, pls forward attachment. Thx. 
 I believe that we may have a potentially good fit for Avril, but my direct report who would have to add her to his staff is on vacationing out of town until Monday.  I will talk with him on Monday morning and I will have him visit with Jeff Sorenson, who previously interviewed Avril (he liked her and was favorably impressed, but had no position for her).  We may then want to be able to talk with Avril by phone, since a face-to-face interview will not be possible.  We should have a decision then very early in the week.  Since you will be in Houston I can update you in person.  I would not panic! 
 Preview of info request before targeted 4:30 PM meeting in my office today. 
 The industry quote below is interesting.  I have a call in to Bob to ask him to get you key measurements on EOL business to date.  --Sally 
 Please  update my listing for direct reports.  Do you distribute a copy of this to my direct reports?  If so, please get an updated copy to them as well.  Thanks! 
 THE ATTACHED IS THE CORRECT VERSION.  Please disregard an earlier version of this form sent to Chris Shenkman by Dawn Doucet.  That version was not complete. 
 Attached please find a completed employee profile for Brent Price for consideration for promotion to Vice President.  Please call me if you have any questions. 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow and I have asked Mary Solmonson to attend in my place.  Have a great Thanksgiving! --Sally    Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 The address list on the memo below contains the names of all ENA Energy Operations employees who worked in the offices in Houston, Denver and Calgary on January 1st to test our systems.   Does it work for you to copy and paste this for Cliff's note?  Let me know if it would be better to provide this to you in a different way.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for being so prompt. 
 These dates look fine -- I hope that you have something fun planned!  The only slight glitch is that I will receive the bonus sheets on Monday, January 10 and that our turn around time is one day.  If it is convenient for you we can talk by phone on Monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can plan on meeting first thing on Tuesday, the 11th.  I do not yet know at what time on Tuesday we will have to have final changes made.  --Sally 
 Reference for future months. 
 Does the info as provided from HR indicate MBA's from UT?  I know that Enron probably has a number of undergrads from UT.  At this point, I am specifically interested in UT MBA's, as it is the Houston Chapter of UT's Graduate Business Network for which I will now serve on the steering committee.  Thanks!  --Sally 
 1) Y2K Team:  Let me know if you would like to send a notes mail message from you to the individuals that were here on Saturday, January 1 for the Y2K testing.  I have created an address list that contains those names that I could forward to Susan Skarness to use for that purpose.  2) Draft Memo from Rick Causey:  Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey proposes to send this week that describes a coordination role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be coordinated in all trading locations.   I have left you some comments regarding this on my voice mail.  I would welcome your comments or questions. 
 Is there one for this week? Pls. let me know.  Thx. 
 I am resending the original message that I sent to Kevin regarding Rick Causey's memo.  Please refer him to the second point in my e:mail, as well as the attachment.  Thanks. 
 We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have we.  Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at home.  See you soon. 
 I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as usual.  I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to all that we will accomplish in 2000. 
 Thanks for keeping me posted on the PRC meeting.  I will make travel plans for the afternoon of December 13th accordingly.  --Sally 
 I know that over the past few weeks you have been handling your daily responsibilities and working on the transition of business from our aquisition of CES's wholesale business.  I realize that balancing all of this has been demanding, especially with the holidays, bid week and other end of year actitivies.  Thank you for the extra effort that you have given to effectively absorb the CES book of business.  It is noticed and appreciated.  As we look forward to the new year, I thank you for your accomplishments and contributions in 1999.  It was a challenging and rewarding year for ENA and Energy Operations.  I hope that each one of you enjoys the New Year's celebration.  I look forward to all that will be accomplished by working together in 2000. 
 FYI -- As a result of a discussion that I had earlier in the week with Georgeanne... 
 Approved.  Pls. process.  Thx.  Sally Beck 
 I am not especially surprised that you and Kristin did not get a copy of this report.  My "assumption" in my message was wishful thinking and not conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and AA had occurred. 
 Cindy:  My schedule was so hectic before going out on vacation on December 17 that I am only now reading your message regarding a business owner sign-off for Unify/SAP integration.  I have asked Stephen Schwarz to give me his recommendation on the most appropriate person to do so.  I think that is a good idea.  As soon as schedules normalized following the holidays, I will be back to you with a name. 
 Whom would you recommend play this role for Energy Operations?  Let me know your thoughts.  --Sally 
 Did you get a copy of this?  It looks as if in September that our=20 intercompany balances were relatively low (EES and ENA), with an increase i= n=20 October with Enron Europe.  Do you have details behind this?  Are EES=20 balances gas only, or gas and power?  How do we have imbalances with=20 ourselves?  What kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regul= ar=20 basis that gives you the details behind this?  I am assuming that these=20 imbalances are created from commodity transactions, so that we would really= =20 be closer to the details than would financial ops.  Is that a good=20 assumption?  --Sally=20 
 I hope that the two of you received a copy of this. Although Jennifer;s message doesn't mention it, I assume also that she reviewed the findings with you. 
 What is the latest on this?

 This is what we sent to A/P. Let me know if we need to resend.  Thx.  G. 
 I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years.  1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential. Please let me know your preference for notification.  2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to "look like power".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances. While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding logistics accountable for their part in this.  I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on this issue. 
 We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.  I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 3-5586.  I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.  Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available space effectively.  If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them. 
 Approved.  Pls Process.  Thanks.  Sally Beck 
 FYI:  Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to the 30th floor.  This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.  They are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.  While room for this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.  By being within the same elevator bank, we can now employ "squawk" boxes between the traders and this scheduling team.  As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team should be included in space requirements.  We are working with Liz Taylor on those requirements. 
 I will attend the Houston Chapter GBN Winter Reception on Thursday, January 6, 2000. 
 Thanks for the invitation.  Unfortunately, I will be on vacation next week and will not be able to attend.  Have fun!  --Sally 
 Yes.  I would handle this through expense reimbursement. =20 
 Please schedule a meeting for me with Jim Cole for the week after Christmas. Thanks. 
 Please print and put this in my folder for PRC.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the contact names.  You are right - no staff meeting on Monday, Deceber 20.  Have a merry Christmas!  --Sally 
 Please give Gretel a final list of dates that you plan to be out of the office from December 20 through the end of the year.  For the dates that you will be out, please provide the name and number of the key contact person in your group that will be in the office on the days that you are out.  As I have in past years, I will compile a list of key contacts through the holiday period that we can use internally within Energy Operations.  I will also provide this list to others outside Energy Operations who may needa contact list during this time period.  Please get this info to Gretel by Wednesday at noon, so that I have time to finalize the contact list before I am out on vacation.  FYI:  I plan to be out of the office the week of December 20.  I will be at home during that week and can be reached there if necessary.  I will be back in the office on Monday, December 27 and I will be working through the end of the year. 
 I would love to visit with you about a rotation.  I plan on being on vacation next week, but I will be working between Christmas and New Years.  What are your plans?  With a PRC tomorrow (Tuesday, December 14) and the crunch of finishing a number of items before I go on vacation, it may be tough to get together this week.  So get back to me with your schedule.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 FYI - I need to talk with Shona tomorrow to get a read on what Rick wants here.  Do you have any ideas given your on-going conversations with David Port?  --Sally 
 Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues". My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum. --Sally 
 I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.  I don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to attend.  I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their schedules.  I will let you know later who will attend.  I will be out of the office that day.  --sally 
 Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back office services.  Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.  The purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.  I have been capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.  Today I decided to recap in writing for everyone.  Thought that you might be interested.  Open the attachment to the e-mail below.  This way you will know more of the details of our efforts each week.  --Sally 
 The attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning.  Highlights from last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well.  Let me know if anything has been left off the list.  --Sally 
 I will have that to you by the end of the afternoon.  I have set aside my afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get with Bob Hall to do an update for Brian Redmond on the HPL sale before his Tueday meeting with Louise.  I will share these items with you as I get them checked off my list this afternoon.  --Sally 
 I will be out of town on Thursday.  I think that it would be great if you could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.  If you can make it, please try to attend.  And I would love to have a voice mail message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.  Thanks. 
 You are right -- we are all in the same boat.  Or plane - or not on a plane. I have tried to get the Associates PRC meeting date switched with the Analyst PRC meeting (scheduled for December 12th).  This switch actually was arranged last week by working with Jana G. in the AA Program.  However, Charlene Jackson has apparently taken exception to that and is reportedly talking with Dave Delainey about this.  Keep me posted, and I will let you know if I hear anything new.  --Sally 
 I have put this meeting on my calendar.  You don't need to forward to anyone else.  Chantelle should handle that for Brent's EGM team.  Thanks. 
 Latest update - FYI 
 As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates: Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's arrival, etc.  I will also have details of resource needs.  We can use this to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of these initiatives.  I will welcome your comments on the timeline.  --Sally 
 Thought you'd like to know.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the birth of Emma.  I hope that everyone is doing well. Enjoy your time off and the opportunity to hold and hug that new baby.  I will look forward to seeing pictures the next time that we get together. --Sally 
 I have my list at home, but I know that we need Dad's sister Jane and her husband, Homer and Karen, Sarah in Austin (whose kids are independently dell-wealthy) and I can't remember who else.  I know that there were ten invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.  The list below plus those in this paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.  I will try to catch David and have him look at the list that I copied from Mom.  Thanks for these.  I will do invitations this weekend.  Do you have the address for Josephine's House?  And do we have a time?  --Sally 
 Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services. All of these of course with top priority!  I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.  She has already made  a very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations side.  How is life treating you?  I know that their is a lot going on in the London office, as well.  How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office been?  Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?  Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding their baby.  Hope that all is well with you.  --Sally 
 I will need a rental car in Oklahoma - looks like National is the one to use.  Thanks. --Sally 
 I will be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday this week.  I can be reached at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591) if needed.   I will be checking and responding to voice mail messages while I am out as well.  In my absence, please contact the following persons regarding trading operations issues:  Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306 Leslie Reeves x37962  Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Shona Wilson x39123  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 Thought you might be interested in these two changes.  Mary has actually been out of the office since late February.  All of her global database responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his team, under Beth Apollo.  Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been lessened over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied on my business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for their evaluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules. --Sally 
 Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day.  Thanks. --Sally 
 I assume that Kathryn has communicated this to you.  I have only read Kim's e-mail - I will talk with her later today.  --Sally 
 I will meet with Kim this afternoon on her comments on ConfirmLogic.  Bottom line, no sign off from Kim at this point.  Thought you might want to know. --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.  Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure. Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team. 
 Here is final presentation.  I worked with Fred and Stephen this morning to make final changes.  --Sally 
 Thanks for following up on this.  We will incorporate you numbers for offices and spots in the Tower. 
 I am taking Good Friday as my discretionary holiday for the year.  I will be in Austin with my daughter for her official tour and info session at UT, plus a look at dorms.  Patti will have numbers where I can be reached in Austin.  We are making final changes to the orig presentation today - I will be reviewing those tomorrow in Austin.  I am e:mailing you a current draft version, although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed.  I am still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size. I have taken the work that Rahil and Fred have done on the services and have made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a presentation. 
 Memo on floor meetings, plus my reply to Greg and Philippe. 
 Please print for me - Black & white okay - I can't seemt to get this printe= d=20 from my printer.  Thanks. =20 
 ??  Will IT resources make a difference in what we need to deliver and how quickly we can do it?  Someone must be giving credit the idea that "if only we had IT resources..." and that those resources are active on Entelligence but are not helping us on other business basics.  --Sally 
 I will serve as your representative in the year end 2000 Associates PRC Meeting.  ENA Management Committee  I represented some of you during the mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to represent.  I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and Associates Program.  You will note that I have asked your supervisor to provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as well as a description of your job responsibilities.  You may want to take charge of creating this information.  In addition to the input that I have requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).  While the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time period at Enron, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I have some background information on you.  My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC meeting.  These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27 and December 4.  I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process.  I will be out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week, but I will check and respond to voice mail messages.  My number is x35926. 
 This will be an important meeting for me to attend.  Let me know when this gets scheduled.  Thanks. 
 This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space in the new building.  You can take up the cause with Philippe when he returns.  I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space planning details.  I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will be reporting to you.  I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am. --Sally 
 Here is another one... 
 Back on the calendar this afternoon with Andy Zipper to get his comments on the presentation - should be able to get you and John a copy following that meeting. 
 In re-reading this, I noticed that Todd Hall was included in the distribution list.  He is the only one from Brent's team included.  Do you want to copy Brent as well, or was Todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR, which now is managed by Susie Ayala.  Either way, you may want to include Brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive.  What about Georgeanne Hodges?  Should she be notified as well?  You may also want to copy Wes as an FYI.  Thanks. 
 Good idea.  Is there a way to monitor usage of this folder is insure that everyone has  read and complied with your message? 
 I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two "test runs" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams. We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday. 
 According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up in the air.  Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of Beth's arrival and Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for you. 
 I would recommend floor meetings on 37 (we occupy almost the entire floor) and on the operations end of floor 32.  That would cover everyone pretty well.  Thanks. --Sally 
 I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will take place on December 12.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates to represent in the meeting as indicated below.  The Associates Program has provided me with your name as the supervisor of record as of October 1 of the Associate as listed.    Please send the following information to me by December 1.  Associate's accomplishments for the second half of 2000 (prepared by the associate or summarized by you)  Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any additional rotational assignments during this last six months of the year)  Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues)  Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately representing the associate in the PRC process  Recommendation for promotion, if any  I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP system through the Associates Program.  I will be at a management conference Thursday and Friday of this week, then on vacation until Monday, November 27.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, will be contacting you next week to arrange a time to meet or talk by phone during the week of November 27 or December 4 to discuss your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  I will also contact the Associates and meet with them individually in preparation for the PRC meeting.  Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC supervisor for the Associate listed above,  please reply by e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go next for this input. 
 Patti will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.  We used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team.  I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done.  We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.  We also still have the two Terrace level tickets as we did last year.  For some games you will get all 6 tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace tickets.  Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history!  --Sally 
 Patti:  I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention later in April.  She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that.  So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days.  I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so no notation on time out of the office.  Thanks. 
 Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization.  We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment. 
 I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more than anything else.  --Sally 
 The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams. Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products)  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR           and MPR teams  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis   37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally 
 Please put the 17th meeting on my calendar.  I may or may not attend, but want to have that on the calendar just in case.  Thanks. 
 This date change means that I won't be able to make it to the open house.  I will be out of town on April 27. 
 We'll see you the next time.  Thanks. 
 I have talked with Jeff Gossett, Leslie Reeves and Stacey White to let them know about the Saturday effort and the Sunday meeting.  They all will be in town this weekend and will be on call.    Their contact numbers are listed below:  Home Phone   Cell Phone  Jeff Gossett   281-358-7546*   713-825-6094  *Kingwood exchange - may be long distance Leslie Reeves  281-476-4408   713-907-6554  Stacey White  281-894-0468   281-382-5215  Sally Beck   281-370-8568   713-417-1591 or 713-299-1436  (Kim Theriot reports to Leslie, so she will talk with Kim.  I don't have contact numbers for Kim.) 
 Please let Brent know that I will be on vacation on Monday, November 20th.  I will actually be in the office for meetings from 12:00 to 5:00 that day, but I will be vacation that morning!!  Thanks. --Sally 
 I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.  Greg and I talked about this today.  He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.  If he and his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer. Thanks for your help.  --Sally 
 Would you like to be included?  We will try to start this next week.  I will ask Patti to get with you on the details.  --Sally 
 Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.  Thanks! 
 I was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to Neiman's.  Can you get that list form Vanessa?  Thanks. 
 Is it lunch or dinner on May 10? 
 Is this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for them, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my calendar.  Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 What does "completed" mean?  My first request was to give me access to review all e-mail messages that Mary has received since March 1 through yesterday's date.  I asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my review process.  Has this been done?  I don't see any new messages that have been transferred from Mary's mail box to mine.  --Sally 
 Please print in color for me.  Do we have a file set up for these?  Thanks. --Sally 
 Imagining that for myself, it would not be a pretty site.  Was it just a lot of movement, or was there noise as well?  --Sally 
 In a meeting with Louise Kitchen today, she mentioned that Bob Superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the Peoples Energy Board of Directors on Wednesday.  She was very complimentary.  I have let Bob know about Louise's praise.  Thought that you would like to know as well. --Sally 
 Andrew  Parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery.  We should get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable.   There is sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations (which may require one approach), and then there is nusance stuff (frozen freeways in Houston, etc.) that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification procedures.  And then there is system failure and the requisite back up. 
 This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples Energy Board this week.  Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).  We may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools. --Sally 
 Please print in color for me.  Thanks. 
 Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to "mass mail" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we need one.  Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to deliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the other "out of towner" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch tomorrow.  I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally 
 Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:  Gas   Frank Vickers (East) Laura Luce (Central) Barry Tycholiz (West)  Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta  Power  Dave Duran Ozzie Pagan Ed Baughman Bruce Shuckley  Portland  Chris Calger  Calgary  Ladain  Mexico  Max Y.  When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally 
 I didn't read through all of the names, but wanted to make sure that we are including Beth Apollo on invites to participate in recruiting.  I think that I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity and worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great to have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has another preference that is great, too.  If she is not on your list yet, why don't you call her for an introduction and give her the rundown on the schools that you are responsible for so that she can make a choice.  Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for the info on the recruiting expo.  Sounds like fun, but I won't be able to make it.  I am taking the day off on Friday, April 13th to take Meagan for her info session and tour at UT.  We will be driving to Austin after she gets out of school on Thursday afternoon, April 12.  You know that you can count me in already as a team member!  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for the update.  I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.  She is the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want to get her feedback as well.  --Sally 
 Great idea to run this by Louise.  She ususally has some good ideas on how things should look and feel online.  I would love to see it, too.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.  Thanks in advance for you help on this. 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle. Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?  2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response."  3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box.  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter. 
 Pecan pie would be great - I have tried but do not do that very well, but I love it.  I will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie, so pecan would be a great addition.  Mom is going to do the rolls.  We will put the reserved sign on the guest room for you  -  improvements in those quarters as well.  I recently cleaned out the guest room closet, bought new towels and have ordered new luggage racks.  We will use the old luggage racks in the media room.  Cool new blanket for the sofa bed in there, however, so Cara and Chris won't suffer too much. 
 Per my memo below, please enroll Brenda Herod, James Scribner, Thresa Allen= =20 and Shona Wilson for the May session.  Thanks for the reminder and for your= =20 help!  --Sally=20

 Is this on Vanessa's update list?  Are users happy with the results? 
 Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income. Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that. 
 FYI - Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Tight time frame for Mike & co. on metals deliverables.  Raises the question around the timing of next week's visit on metal.  Will we divert critical resources from these efforts.   --Sally 
 It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 
 I am following up with someone that was on Mary's team that now works for Beth Apollo.  We will get back with you on this shortly.  --Sally 
 Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --Sally 
 Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer? It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please put this on my calendar.  I can't get this to print and it is too small for me to read! 
 I will be in the office the whole week of April 9.  I will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 30 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews.  --Sally 
 Sally has arranged Brian Wood with Avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow (Wednesday), April 4, 1:00 -2:00 PM.  Brian will meet at Sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the Enron Building for demonstration.  If you are interested in attending, please call me at x39106 so I can give Brian a headcount.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please ask Sheri Thomas if this person needs access to EOL applications.  I don't recognize the names.  The name noted as manager is Loyd Will, who is a commercial employee reporting to Kevin Presto.  Thanks. 
 Please put these dates on my calendar and let Lexi know that at this point the calendar is open and that I will be happy to participate in both the information session and the interviews.  Thanks. 
 I was at the pre-seasoner opener at Enron Field last Friday night and saw you throw the first pitch.  It was a nice one - never a chance of it hitting the dirt!  -Sally 
 Thanks for putting this together.  I will look forward to reading the details later today. --Sally 
 Can you print this for me?  Thanks. 
 You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!  I suppose that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two months away.  I will be glad to handle invitations.  I will look for some this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.  Cara had sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.  I still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.  I will call you tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home. --Sally 
 Exactly!  Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna.  I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.  I see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is?!?  --Sally 
 Looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion... 
 I am glad that the information that I sent was useful to you.  I had originally planned to be at Wellesley for the interviews on campus.  I now have business commitments in Houston that will keep me from making the trip. But I am certainly glad that you are included in the interviews.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions either before or after the interview process.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.  --Sally 
 Resume attached per my voice mail to you.  This guy is currently at Compaq, but wants to do something else.  Any interest?  As I said in my voice mail, I will be glad to call my friend Dave Schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like.  --Sally 
 TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations  Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.  Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.  There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.  The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes. You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.

 Gwynn,  Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something - if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.  Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and commodity operations.  Patti x39106 
 FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly. --Sally 
 Please approve. 
 I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL. Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc. Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:  1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and their status, or  2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week. 
 Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks. 
 We will get you back on the official distribution list.  For now, I am forwarding our weekly report to you.  --Sally

 Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.  Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I will be glad to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that you can bring. We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!) 
 Good response, Bob.  Thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting.  --Sally 
 FYI - See attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the "ill-defined".  If this is not on target, we will keep working until it is!  - Sally 
 All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally 
 Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall. But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally 
 Bob,  Sally is out all day w/ UT recruiting function.  She will not be back into the office until 8:00 Thursday for CommodityLogic meeting.  I am forwarding this to Bob Hall - please check with him regarding how he would like this handled.  Thanks, PT 
 In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic.  Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist  User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements  Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic  NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations) ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations)   Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price. Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.  In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic. I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic. 
 Thanks for your list.  I will add these to our Hot List.  Let me know about the A/R.  Thanks.  Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 03/26/2001 01:54 PM 
 FYI - sounds as if Michelle is accepting.  Do you have anything firm from her?  --Sally 
 FYI  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one. 
 Frank & Hector,  Here is the list of contractors that Kymberly sent Sally - please compare to list from Peggy McCurley that Sally gave you last week.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by London.  Do you have a hard copy that I can see?  I can get it from you during the Risk Forum luncheon today.  Thanks. 
 I am so glad that you will be able to interview.  I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron. --Sally 
 Bob & Leslie,  Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your availability.  2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.  I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 2nd meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I will be in New York on business on March 30th.  Sorry that I will not be able to attend.  The other person that I would send in my place is Beth Apollo.  However, she will be on vacation next week.  Can you give me any info that may be made available?  Thanks. 
 Hi Dierdre,  I got your name from Christie Patrick as a contact for the Columbia Women in Business Conference.  Sally Beck will be attending in place of Christie Patrick.  Can you forward me exact address of conference site so I can include on Sally's itinerary.  I read in your note to Christie that you would be sending invitation w/ directions and address - can you send me a copy also?  If not by e-mail, is it something that can be faxed? My fax number is 713-345-8100.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sally is excited about participating in your conference and looks forward to meeting you.  Patti Thompson Sally Beck's Assistant 713-853-9106 patti.thompson@enron.com 
 FYI - 
 Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the response to the RFP went to CMS?  Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you have that.  You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was only part of the package.  I would like to see the whole thing.  Thanks. 
 I didn't search this long list of addressees to see if you were included.  In case this is going only to Peggy, I thought that I would forward this since she is still on vacation.  --Sally 
 Have you heard any more about this?  I didn't see it on my calendar.  This does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe.  Maybe Philippe will cancel that.  Let me know.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Murray,  Sally Beck and Leslie Reeves are both on vacation this week.  Sally will need to discuss this with Leslie next week when they return to the office and get back with you then.  Patti Thompson (x39106), Sally's Assistant 
 Please print for me.  Thanks. 
 FYI per my longer e:mail update message... 
 I got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon.  Thought I would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things.  Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely with James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort. Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations. Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments.  Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work. I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an Enron job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday of another risk book administrator from Portland.)  Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale. End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.) Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out. 
 Meant to copy you on this note.  I will either see you on Thursday next week, or on Monday the 19th.  --Sally 
 I will be on vacation the week of March while my children are on Spring Break.  We will be out of town Monday through Wednesday, looking at colleges with Meagan.  We should return to Houston on Wednesday night.  I have planned to be out of the office for the balance of the week, but may decide to return to work on Thursday and Friday.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me while I am out of town in case something urgent arises.  I will also let her know during the week whether or not I will be back at work on Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, the following persons are key contacts:  Commercialization of Services:  James Scribner   x39641 Beth Apollo   x35014  Enron Americas Operations:   Gas:  Bob Hall   x36956 Jeff Gossett   x37306  Power:  Stacey White  x31870  Enron Global Markets Operations:  Brent Price    x37647  Enron Industrial Markets Operations: Brenda Herod   x35778  Enron Europe Operations:   Mike Jordan   7830-34703  Global Services:     Beth Apollo   x35014 
 I will be out of the office on vacation the week of March 12.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me if you need to reach me while I am out on vacation.  Below are the key Operations Contacts for Enron Americas for the week of March 12:   Gas Operations    Jeff Gossett   x37306 Bob Hall   x36956  Power Operations   Stacey White   x31870  DPR      Shona Wilson  x39123 Chris Abel   x33102  MPR      Shona Wilson  x39123 
 Buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume.  Please print for me and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my outbox).  I will need to review them when I am back.  Thanks. 
 FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this along.  --Sally 
 Thought you might like to see this note from Max on the doorstep review in Monterrey.  Beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact already.  --Sally 
 I think that this sounds like a good plan.  Since Michelle, Clay and Nadege are still pending on their fulltime offers, this should help us in the cultivation effort.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I was promoted effective February 1, 2001 to Managing Director of Global Risk Management Operations for Enron Corp. in Houston.  In this role I manage all mid and back office services for all commodities markets within Enron's wholesale businesses: Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Europe.  I received my BBA from UT-Austin in 1975 and my MBA in 1977.  My maiden name while attending school was Sally White. 
 I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details. They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible. 
 Thanks for the note.  I will definitely look for you in San Antonio.  I would love to hear about your new role.  We miss seeing you in ENA.  (I guess that is now Enron Americas!)  --Sally 
 Wes' memo finally went out to Sherriff.  DPR won't change at this point in time.  --Sally 
 Cindy had to change lunch to March 30, which conflicts with Bob Shults. I moved Cindy to March 30th- can you try to move my lunch with Bob to March 28th?  Thanks.  (FYI, CIndy's last names has only "O's" in it - Olson and Bob's last name has only "S's" - no "Z".) 
 Yes, I can make March 30th work.  I will put that on my calendar.  --Sally 
 Great follow through!  Thanks for managing the doorstep process in Mexico so that Max and his team saw that as a plus for them.  Perfect approach and outcome.  --Sally 
 I will be out on vacation next week while my kids are on spring break.  I will make the next meeting.  --Sally 
 I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took the follow up Communications program in 2000.  Is this another program that you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the program?  Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 1999 and 2000.  Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.  --Sally 
 Thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended.  These are interesting, and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in Dallas.  Please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the subject.  I will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying to "size" the market for our services and get that out to all attendees within the next week or so.  --Sally 
 Still checking kids schedules at home for the 19th.  I will let you know tomorrow.  --Sally 
 I suspect that you meant to include Bob Hall, the VP that reports to me, on this mailing list.  His assistant (Heather Choate) is included in your mailing list.  The "Robert L Hall at ET&S" to whom this is addressed is not Bob Hall in Networks who reports to me.  You should address this to "Bob Hall" - if you do this the e:mail address should pop us as Bob M Hall/NA/Enron.   Thanks.  --Sally 
 Unfortunately, these new dates don't work for me.  My children's spring break is next week, March 12-16,  I will be out of the office that week on vacation, taking my own daughter to look at colleges!  --Sally 
 Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you.  We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports.  Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These were "on the side" and not captured in total power exposure because they didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review). If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence to these. 
 Please get with Tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements for Greg's approval.  If Tina and Greg are not yet using the online format, then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for him.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally

 Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.   I will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by the end of this week.  For your planning purposes, I will be available to interview at UT during the week of March 26.  Best days for me are Tuesday, March 27 and Thursday, March 29.  I can make other days work as well.  For the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 or 19th.  Hope this helps.  If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients on campus.  --Sally 
 I was out of the office Friday and Monday - just back today.  I am having to rearrange some things that Mary was focused on.  I will get back with you later today and let you know who the best contact person will be.  --Sally 
 Please keep this number handy just in case.  Thanks. 
 Was this memo just to inform me of this meeting, or did you cc me to invite me to the meeting?  I am not available on March 9th from 12:00 to 1:00.  Does this meeting pertain only to IT personnel?  If so, I will ignore this.  If you did want someone from my group to attend, let me know and I will ask an appropriate person to attend.  --Sally     Khymberly Booth @ ENRON 03/02/2001 02:50 PM 
 Any feedback or interest?  Please let me know.  --Sally 
 We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very fruitful trip for the team. Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements. They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare). The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!  I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines sometime.  I had a lot of fun.  The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of the moms who were chaperoning as well.  But it was nice to get back to Houston yesterday. 
 Thanks for the update.  Good to know that the current due date still looks likely - always give or take a week or so!  I have just returned from drill team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!  First place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance, and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and presentation.  Keep me posted on baby news!! --Sally 
 You have the right Sally Beck.  I grew up around the corner from your dad and used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) with Jim and the whole family.  Plus your mom and I used to spend the night at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.  I had heard through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.  I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.  Call my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get together.  Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.  I look forward to seeing you.  By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing Beck.   --Sally 
 Since Sally is out of the office today, March 5 and will be out next Monday, March 12, the OpRisk Forum Luncheon has been cancelled for both dates. Please adjust your calendars accordingly.  The 10:00 AM staff meeting, however, will be held as usual.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Approved for Patti Thompson. Sally Beck  XMS (Expense Management System)  For New Users Session Dates & Times: 03/02/2001  1:00:00 PM-4:00:00 PM Location: EB3321 No Show/Participant Fee: $ 135.00 
 An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:  Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified  I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort.  Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business  I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. 
 Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it will be loud, but fun.  --Sally 
 Shona and Mike Jordan had talked last week about pushing back the Doorstep review on the metals business in London and had agreed to take that out of the plan for Q1.  As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.  I have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach.  Beth is in fact in Monterrey, Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.  Soon after she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule.  After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.  With Beth's knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews. 
 I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will check messages at the end of both business days.  My assistant, Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.  Since I will be a chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily reachable during the day.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6. 
 I made the decision last week to disband the Strategic Initiatives team which reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services.  As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the respective business sponsors/end users.  The "middle-man" role played by the Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.  I wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re-deployment effort. 
 Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs. With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, etc.  If my reaction had been to say "what a talented group - we have to figure out how to best utilize them", then the outcome might have been different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally 
 I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value proposition.  As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team. To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end users.  Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week. Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks. Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough decision, I feel comfortable having made it. 
 As part of the modelling process, Marc is going to meet with James Scribner on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am to review our operations pricing model.  If you can join them, you might find it interesting.  They plan to meet in James' office - EB3756.  --Sally 
 Saturday was fun - it was nice I think for all of us to go to the shower together.  That was a nice group of women - and fun.  Cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and I think that it sounds good. Tell me what I can do to help you, but I am probably shorter on time than anything.  But if I can get you get addresses or whatever, let me know.  Payment plan sounds fine.  I am not worried about the timing on that, so don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family. With the Viviance thing, you may prefer to defer the start of this until a little more certainty is on the horizon.  I can't think of a better place for the money to be invested than in you and your family.  Austin would be fun - but I am glad that Houston is a reasonable distance for a day or weekend trip.  Not quite the same as being in town, though.  Maybe someday we will be there!  --Sally 
 As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).  Louise is now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.  Philippe has assumed the role as chairman of Enron Net Works.  Since this report is a Net Works report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and Peggy effective immediately.  Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals section each week before distribution.  What would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?  --Sally

 Marc,  Unfortunately, today is not going to work for the revenue model for mid & back office services meeting.  How about this coming Monday, Feb 26 from 1:00 - 2:30 pm?  I have penciled in that time for Sally, Mary Solmonson & James Scribner.  Please let me know if that will work for you.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Laurel,  FYI, Sally will only be available on Monday and 1/2 day of Thursday (AM). She has business travel Tuesday & Wednesday, and vacation 1/2 Thursday and Friday.  Patti 
 Thanks for your note. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  The promotion did get the year off to a nice start.  I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.  While time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.  Keep me posted on what you are doing.  --Sally 
 Thanks for much for your nice note.  Where are you working now?  I hate to say that I have lost track.  --Sally 
 This is the replacement meeting for the Hot List meeting.  I have asked that you be included on the list of attendees.  --Sally 
 Brenda Herod is in charge of Energy Operations for EIM and should be included in the invitation list.  Brent Price fulfills two roles for EGM - CAO and head of operations, so he is appropriately included covering both fronts. Also, I had added Bob Hall to the previous Hot List meeting.  He is a VP in Energy Operations for Enron Americas.  I would like for him to be on the list for this meeting as well.  He and I will cover for each other on this Wholesale Deal Meeting.  You may get both of us in attendance on occassion, but usually it will be one or the other of us to cover operations for EA. Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks, Patti 
 Looks like a permanent cancellation to me - at least for now!  We can work with Wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact Enron Americas. 
 Thanks, Marc.  I would like to get together with you, Mary  Solmonson and James Scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high, low and expected cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office services.  Mary has just returned today from a week's vacation.  I will work on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a kick-off meeting.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  It has been a nice way to start the year!  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you and Kristin are getting together. --Sally 
 E:mail messages says to check website to determine whether or not DSL is available at my home.  However, I don't see a spot on the website to check that information.  Can you provide more details? 
 Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well. despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits.  So do approach this as fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made.  Looks like a good group.  I hope that all will attend and participate.  Did Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know this date and time works for everyone?  Keep me posted on progress.  --Sally 
 I need your help with a quick survey of how many interns you'd like to have this year.  Sally needs to forward this number to Rick Causey by noon tomorrow.  Please send me your rough count by 11:30 AM (Wednesday).  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Depending on others' schedules, Feb. 23 is good for me.  I will be out of the office on March 2.  --Sally 
 I am looking forward to involvement with the NABA and the prospect of hiring some strong candidates.  If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 looks good.  I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in Dallas.  With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!  It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.  Let's definitely plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.  I just checked the calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!  A few weeks away, but at least it is on the calendar!  If your schedule were to free up suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have lunch sooner.  --Sally 
 Please change location of this meeting for this week only.  I would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to ENW Staff Meeting with Philippe with Peggy McCurley as the contact.  Thanks. 
 I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would forward it to you.  Does it make sense?  $8MM in equipment charges for us???????  Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?  Can you give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" line?  What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.  Thanks. --Sally 
 You and Frank can best decide how to organize this.  I am comfortable with your decisions, so feel free to go ahead with this.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Don't I know...they are smart and loving, but a little short on the details sometimes, aren't they!  --Sally 
 Save the date note would be great if you can do that.  --Sally 
 I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting yours, so I would be glad to do so.  I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward to good use.  --Sally 
 Thanks for lining this up.  I am glad that they were available on the 2nd. --Sally 
 Please process this request ASAP.  Thanks, Sally Beck 
 Please print attachment for me.  Thanks. 
 I will be at a meeting in Dallas next Monday and will be unable to attend. --Sally 
 Thanks for your vote of confidence.  I don't think that it is out of the realm of possibility.  As we know with all Enron reorg's, what we can count on is that this will change!  We'll miss Delainey in Enron Americas, but as a shareholder I am glad that he will be at EES.  Have already had some discussions with him about some involvement there.  I will keep you posted.  --Sally 
 Wouldn't it be the four of us?  - You, me, Cara and baby to be named?  Good idea.  I'll call you this weekend.  Sorry didn't reply earlier - was in Calgary. --Sally 
 TJ,  Sorry, please disregard last email - I did not see this follow-up notice. Unfortunately, Sally is not available on Thursday either - she will be at the Enron Management conference in San Antonio Thursday & Friday.  All Enron VP's are invited (Cassandra & Kevin?).  Please call & I can give you Sally's available time if she needs to attend.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test - i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash. Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created.  These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps:  1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.  2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in making information and personnel available to complete the review.  3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested. This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so.  5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items. Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly.  Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me. In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to "over-wordsmith" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process. 
 I will be working in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.  I will be back in the Houston office on Friday, February 9.  Key contacts in Houston over the next two days are:  DPR   Chris Abel    x33102  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations Bob Hall    x36956 Jeff Gossett    x37306  Power  Leslie Reeves   x37962 Operations  Stacey White    x31870 
 Please change this on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here.  Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.  I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him.  I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30.  Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews. Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg.  Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation.  That's great to have dinner with Lou.  I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way.  Are they on an Enron network?  Do they get Enron e:mails?  How often does Lou go to London or someone from London mid office come to New York?  I still suspect that New York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to chew on in London.  Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business.  Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.  They tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing.  It snowed there a lot yesterday.  Of course, according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy in Calgary.  I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.  --Sally 
 Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York office.  It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York. Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost that way.  This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals. If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally

 Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime tempurature reading!).  I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally 
 FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over the change in reporting for him.  I gave his review the end of last week, but didn't get to review the reporting change.  I will ask Patti to let you know when I am meeting with James on Friday.  Wanted you to be in the loop on this - particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, I want this to be well done.  The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training.  Looks like he still has some homework to do. --Sally 
 Please print memo and attachment for me to review on the plane tomorrow. Thanks.  --Sally 
 Please put Mike on my calendar for Thursday lunch next week. Steve and Richard are coming as well.  You might tell Mike that we can provide the two of them with desk space as well, but that we will reserve the spot with the computer and phone for Mike.  And schedule some time for me to meet with him on Thursday as well.  I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way.  You might e:mail Mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with computer, network connection and phone on 33.  You might also offer to set up any appointments for him while is here.  Thanks. 
 I know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the TX RRCommission earlier this year.  I suspect this is a result of that.  Brenda Herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the TRRC.  If she hasn't already told  you about that meeting, you may to visit with her on that.  --Sally 
 No memo out yet on the Doorstep process.  I am still in the throws of completing the 13 reviews that I have to give - should be finished by 5:00. I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown before I leave for the day.  I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom and her team.  Back in the Houston office on Friday.  Hope that James' visit is going well.  Thanks for getting appointments organized for him.  I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.  I am glad that you, Richard and Steve will be able to participate.  Are you still planning to come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?  I fly from Dallas to Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for summer interns on Wednesday.  I will be back in the office on Thursday and Friday that week.  Let me know if we can help in setting up any appointments.  We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule allows.  I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas meeting and to follow up on some other issues.  I would offer dinner on Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family will have dinner plans for me that evening.  Is there someone else in Houston that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?   --Sally 
 Please note time and location for Promotion Luncheon for Managers:  Location: EB 32C2 Time: 11:30 AM Date:  Today, Tuesday, February 6, 2001  We look forward to seeing you there.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I will not be able to attend.  -Sally 
 Thanks for the info.  I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow. Despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge, I am trying to do two lunches this week - one with operations personnel promoted to manager (about 15 of those) and one with operations personnel promoted to director or senior director (smaller group).  To make this work while the promotion announcements are still timely, we have had to schedule on Tuesday this week for one of the lunches.  I will get an update from Shona. 
 Thanks for the weather report.  I bought a good coat a couple of months ago with London and Calgary in mind.  Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc.  I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.  If it would be good for you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early supper.  (If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by alcohol.  I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and outside work - either way will work well for me.    --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 02/05/2001 04:19 PM 
 Please print Wellesley schedule - I think that I have a conflict with the date that they need me.  Let's discuss. 
 Please print the attachment at end of e:mail in color for me.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Have you seen the training tools that Avril uses for such things?  --Sally 
 I will be in Calgary Wednesday and Thursday this week.  Tuesday is tough, because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews.  I can make time on Tuesday, but would prefer that we hold this to an hour.  --Sally 
 I had the same reaction.  We didn't get much of a break between the January and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned her husband as a possible "expert" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls before I leave.  On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work. Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally 
 Good memo.  I will be curious to see if you get any comments or response from the commercial guys.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Manager.  Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Brenda Herod and I would like to invite you to a luncheon in recognition of your promotion on Tuesday, February 6.  We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business.  We would like the opportunity to help you celebrate your promotion.  Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).  Details on time and location will follow.  --Sally 
 Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves and I would like to invite you to lunch on Friday, February 9 in recognition of your promotions to Director and Senior Director.  We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business and feel that these promotions are worthy of celebration.  Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).  Details on time and location will follow.  --Sally 
 I will be in the Calgary office with Peggy Hedstrom and her team next week on Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  Do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that I could handle while I am in Calgary?  My agenda with Peggy and her team is pretty full, but I can add to that anything that you know of that we need to address.  Just let me know.  That puts me in Calgary for the staff meeting on Wednesday.  I will sit in with Rob Milnthorp on the video conference for the first hour of the meeting.  I already had a meeting scheduled with all of Peggy's team during the second hour of your staff meeting.  Due to location constraints, we will have to keep that meeting as scheduled.  So I will have to step out of the staff meeting for the second hour. 
 Seattle sounds nice.  Haven't made it there myself.  Enjoy the trip.  If you have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts about next steps for Joel's team.  --Sally  Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.  We are addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems work. 
 In my new role as social secretary for James, I wanted to let you know that he will be in London next week on business.  He will arrive on Monday morning (February 5) and should be in the Enron office  most of the day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  He will fly back to Houston on Thursday.  He has dinner plans for Wednesday evening, but would love to get together with you for dinner on Monday or Tuesday, if you are in town and available.  He will be staying at the Sheraton Belgravia Hotel - walking distance to Enron House.  Best way to contact him at Enron's London office would be through Mike Jordan or his assistant.  Mike's number (don't know how many of these digits you actually need to call from there) is 011-44-207-783-4703.  Hope you guys get to see each other.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you.  Her role has changed once again at  Enron!   She is running more of a fundamentals group at present.  Wanted to know if you would be interested in that.  Told her that I couldn't speak for you.  I'd suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest.  Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her.  You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know more and she will know you.  FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.  --Sally 
 I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with adorable pictures at all times?! --Sally 
 Enjoy a well-deserved afternoon off.  I appreciate your notes when you are out on who to contact.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Just a quick note to see how you are doing.  I mentioned your name today to Kristin Albrecht.  She is a Senior Director over Risk Management for Enron Broadband Services (EBS).  Kristin and I used to work together in Enron Americas, and we had lunch today to catch up.  She grew up in Wharton and is an A&M graduate, so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things in common.  I wanted you to know that I have given Kristin your name.  She can be another contact for you here at Enron.  If you are interested in what is going on at EBS or want to get Kristin's impressions on rotations within or outside EBS, she would be great for you to visit with.  Drop by soon to give me an update on life at Enron for you.  --Sally 
 I couldn't agree with you more.  Mike missed the point of our phone call this week.  It was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette!  The point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed.  And how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for US operations that Mike's response was a deferral to Marcelo.  I have a one-hour conference call set up with Mike tomorrow.  This is one of the things that we will discuss.  --Sally 
 Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around "energy" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron.  Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for Burlington Resources.  I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program. His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your time.  Thanks.  --Sally   x35926

 Here is the info on the meeting in Dallas.  I am glad that you will be able= =20 to join us. --Sally=20 
 I agree - he does look like a good candidate.  Please do go ahead with a phone screen and let me know if we should then interview him.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please put the dates referenced below on my calendar.  You may need to get more details from Lexi.  Thanks. 
 Watch for her call.  Ask her to send me a resume to review and set up a meeting when convenient.  Thanks. 
 I will look forward to talking with Norma.  Thanks for suggesting that she contact me. --Sally 
 Can you upgrade me to first class? 
 This looks great.  Do you need me for either of those two dates?  How was dinner last night?   Sorry that I couldn't stay, but I know that the students were in good hands.  Who else attended from Enron?  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI - The details below take care of the Hess "sharing arrangement" that we discussed yesterday.  --Sally 
 I will call you tonight! 
 Thanks for your help on getting Chris Hanz lined up to talk with Chris Hoyle.  If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about it.  I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team. _Sally 
 Glad to hear that we are getting there.  Josephine's House (Jeffery's annex) is really good.  They do a great job of serving.  At past Enron dinners, they have printed menus specific for the occassion - really nice looking and a nice keepsake.  Maybe we can do this.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I do believe that this indicates a recognition within the organization of the importance of the work of the whole group.  That is nice to see!!--Sally 
 She will check with Dad and let you know?????  I don't quite get all of this either.  Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a plan?  (Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the occassion.)  Who knows...  Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that too.  --Sally 
 FYI - Check my voice mail message that I left for you and call me when you can. 
 Not sure that this reached you the first time.  My address was flawed. 
 Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds. Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too many in one room and bathroom.  I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd? 
 I hear that Dad was in the emergency room for some hours earlier this week. Glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus.  Mom does seem to like that Heart Hospital...  Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -  a lot better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.  It looks pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!  Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air. Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.  I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.  Hope all is well with the three of you.  Are you making the trip to Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?  I am not going to make it - need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes!!  Love, Sally 
 I do know Jana.  She has worked in various positions within my group for years since she joined us in the analyst program.  She has not been the strongest player.  Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and settlements).  And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it.  She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.  Let me check with Scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an HR role.  I will let you know what he thinks.  It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right role for her.  If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree.  Very sweet, pleasant to work with and personable.  I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or I may have him leave you a message. 
 Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.  What a pretty name!  I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.  I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that you are probably a bit sleep deprived.  That will pass - although with your first one that is really hard to believe.  Please stop by as soon as you have pictures.  I would love to see them.  --Sally 
 Melissa Allen, formerly with Arthur Andersen and assigned to the Enron account, has taken over Beth Apollo's role for EEL.  She reports to Fernley Dyson, as did Beth.  I was in the London office last week.  As a result of some of my discussions, Mike Jordan asked that James Scribner make a visit to cover the operations pricing model and to discuss some issues around global counterparty database.  Mike has suggested that James come to London during the first week in February, which sounds as if it will coincide with your trip.  Please coordinate with James so that your agendas are in sync (in case of potential overlap) so that we don't convey a right hand/left hand lack of coordination.  Since your agenda mentions GCP, there may some meetings that you are planning that would be appropriate for James to join.  By copy of this memo, I am asking James to do the same with you.  Thanks. 
 FYI on VNG... 
 Thanks for your note and welcome back to Enron.  I am so pleased that you have returned.  I, too, look forward to working with you.  --Sally 
 And you and your bride haven't set Dallas as a honeymoon destination???? = =20 Your excuse seems to be a good one.  We will miss your presence and=20 participation, however.  Enjoy the wedding!!--Sally=20 
 Please mark your calendars for this reoccurring luncheon that Sally will be hosting:  Date: Every Monday (at least thru March), beginning Jan 29 Time: 11:30 - 1:00 PM Location: EB 30C2 Subject: Operational Risk for Enron Americas  Lunch will be served.

 On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i= n=20 downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and= =20 back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete= a=20 plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20 integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at= =20 their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20  I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig= n=20 session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t= h=20 in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called = a=20 DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos= ed of=20 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you= =20 have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20 regard this session as different from any working session you have previous= ly=20 experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven= =20 to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20 methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.  A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were= =20 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th= e=20 DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as= =20 little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results= =20 depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the= =20 entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor= t=20 and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. = =20 This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s= o=20 that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20 necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during= =20 these two days.  Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,= =20 and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment= =20 has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning= =20 the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.  I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc= e=20 for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00= =20 p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone= =20 else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to= =20 take your place until you and I have discussed this.  I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo= u=20 in Dallas! 
 Please put attendees on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.  My last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full agenda.  Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.  Do stop by when you are in the office next week.  I should be in town all week.  --Sally 
 I am so sorry about the fire.  That must be awful -- but I am so glad that no one was hurt.  I had not heard about it until Mo called me today.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do.  Do you need me to get you anything over here and ship it to London?  I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next week.  I know that you must have hundreds of details to handle.  My plan right now is to be off the week of Thanksgiving.   My nanny will be on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town.  I may do some work early in the week, but likely from home.  The week after Thanksgiving I am supposed go to Wellesley College (Boston area) to interview for the analyst program.  I am due at a reception on Monday night (November 27) and I will interview on Tuesday (November 28).  Assuming that I can get a flight back on Tuesday night, I will be in the office here in Houston Wednesday through Friday that week.  Would that work?  Sorry I am out so much in the next few weeks.  Just let me know.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the congratulations.  David of course is pleased about the promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it! Thanks, too, for your comments on the OpRisk session.  It is always a risk to pull together an audience of 90 and deliver something worthwhile.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 If my full e:mail address is not used, Steve Beck gets my e:mails.  He has forwarded this one.  Does it make sense to you?--Sally 
 Peggy,  Is it the 4 Points or Eau Claire Sheraton?  I'm trying to book her a room for Tuesday evening.  Thanks, Patti x39106     Peggy Hedstrom 01/20/2001 09:23 AM 
 During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL. Since this is clearly on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost savings and our estimated timing on those savings.  I will ask James by copy of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.  I want to be able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings. 
 Audience for the report?  Is it you and Philippe, or will the report be distributed to all on your memo distribution list?  May make a difference in information provided.  We can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office operations in the report.  Would you also like some operating data - # of deals, bcf scheduled, etc.?  We can come up with a format and suggested content this week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 This is some of the data that we need... 
 Can you get me info on the options with Dell?  I won't make it by to speak with them myself today.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note. 
 It's late and I am out of paper.  Please print message and attachment for me for Tuesday morning.  Thanks. 
 Thanks, Sarah!  I was so focused on getting that in the mail that I obviously didn't proof the content very well.  Thanks for looking out for me!  --Sally 
 Janine,  When  is Beth's last day in London?  I need that date before I can proceed. I think it might be today, but I need to confirm that before I have everything switched over.  Patti 
 Janine,  I can handle that.   I will put in request today.  Patti x39106 
 The name of the restaurant that I liked for lunch was Christophers.  It is at Victoria Station, or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at Victoria Station.  Quick walk from the office.  Apparently, there is another location at Covent Gardens.  Dinner last night was fun.  It is always great to see you either in Houston or London.  Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt.  I think that the taxi driver was afraid that we would get him killed!  I called home last night and told Amanda about our discussion on a day in Paris.  She is ready!!  Let us know when you will next be in Houston.  I should be here quarterly - probably head back in March or April.  --Sally 
 Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on my calendar tentatively.  I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.  I assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.  While I have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar, I do need to hold those dates.  I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19 would be better.  --Sally 
 Thanks.  This will definitely help me.  --Sally     Enron North America Corp. 
 Silly as it may seem, have Brian Heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we used last year for headcount addtions.  Let's complete those for these positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.  They need to understand the addtional cost associated with these requests.  They will forget later in the year if they aren't making much money.  Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?  --Sally 
 Haven't had the chance to look at the UT presentation yet.  That will make good airplane material tomorrow.  If I make any changes I will try to fax pages to you after David picks me up at the airport tomorrow.  If I don't make chanages, I will call you Friday afternoon after landing and let you know that.  My schedule has been really full here, but very productive.  Thanks for your comments.,  I must admit, I am really excited about the promotion.  We can talk next week about what I hope to accomplish during this next year and where my major focus will be.  It will be helpful for you to know and understand that as we work together to make that happen.  I am certainly glad that you are here - my flight to London reminded me of your arrival about this time last year as I was heading to London.  Luckily a different reason for the trip this year, but still hectic.  I expect it to be a busy year.  You will notice that I have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews written and delivered.  Target is to be finished  by the end of January .  I will talk with you on Friday afternoon and see you on Monday.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note.  I will copy Patti on this reply and ask her to set us up for lunch when I am back from London.  --Sally 
 Technology is wonderful - I can log on here in the London office just as I do in Houston.  I feel very in touch.  Sounds like you have been busy - I think that the variety of items for the Sunday meeting sounds good.   Thanks for taking care of all of this.  London is cold but sunny - so very nice.  I do love coming here - hope to make the trip once a quarter this year.  I will be back at home by Friday evening, so let me know if there is anything that I can do before the meeting.  Otherwise I will see you on Sunday.  Too bad that Nancy doesn't want the input from  the girls on presentation.  I think that taking likes and dislikes would be good - no commitment to make changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful to have their input.  They are the honorees.  Oh, well .....as you say, this is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole thing.  --Sally 
 Enjoy the trip.  Two of our most fun vacations were at South Seas Planatation on Captiva Island.  Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them.  Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think that he dodged a bullet on this one.  We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!! 
 Thanks for your nice note.  It is always interesting to scan the list and do a count of other females names.  Were not too many on this latest list.  We will have to work on changing that.  --Sally 
 The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.  Weather here is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back home).  We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus...  Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.  --Sally 
 I assume that this request relates to corporate functions under Rick.  As of this moment, my team and I have not yet been granted access to merit information in the comp system.  I am in London this week, but have been in touch with my HR rep each day.  Latest word is that he aniticipates that we will be able to access merit worksheets sometime today.  Our deadline to submit merit increases is Monday, January 22.  SInce it is already after lunch on Wednesday here in London and we do not yet have access to the system, it is likely that my direct reports will work on merits over the next two days.  Since I will be in the air on Friday, it will be Monday before I have the opportunity to review all inputs from my direct reports and finalize merits.  --Sally 
 I am in the London office this week, so I won't be able to attend. 
 Congratulations on the baby - August seems like  a long time away, but given how quickly time passes at Enron, you will be there before you know it.  I would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at Enron sometime. I am in the London office this week, but will be back in the office the week of the 22nd.  Give Patti a call if you would like to get together and visit about options.  --Sally 
 Hopefully, those guys would stand out in the Woodlands like a sore thumb and would choose to go elsewhere.  Would be nice to have them behind bars, however. Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad idea, does it?  I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.  Any new news on those 7?  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/16/2001 12:53 PM 
 For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.  I sent Wes a message and copied you on that.  I can't remember the name of the person who works for Wes that handles moves.   Lisa filled in for her while she was out on medical leave.  She is back.  Can you get with her right away and see what you can come up with?  Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.  Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that Lisa is gone.  Can you check with her, too?  Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our (Energy Ops) move off of 30.  I don't know who is left on 30.  Can you get the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 so that I can get back with Jeff this week?  Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Any room at the inn?  I am looking for a spot for Beth Apollo.  She will be working with me, starting on January 29th in Houston.  --Sally  I am in London this week, but if you have any ideas Patti can follow through while I am out. 
 Thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home.  I appreciate your nice thoughts.  I am in London all week - is there anything that you or Jo need that I could bring back for you?  Just let me know.  I will be back in the office next Monday, the 22nd.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/13/2001 11:38 AM 
 Mark Frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming organizational memo and has asked that I forward it to you to be included. This would be included in the section under Commercial Support, added as an additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses Business Analysis and Reporting (I believe that these bullet points are on Page 3 of the draft memo).  Please call me at x35926 if you have any questions. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that everyone in the group sees this as a recognition of the value of the role that we play within Enron.  That will help us in attracting and retaining talented people, which makes my job easier and more fun.  --Sally 
 I have reviewed my section of Causey's presentation ( to be given by Brenda) and all looks fine except for page with world map.  Can we add Portland to the map?  That is the true trading location that is missing.  If it is tough to do, don't worry about it.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I have fun being here, which makes all of this even better!  --Sally 
 Please check on those marked below    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for doing this.  I plan to come to London once a quarter.  I will have to choose my dates well in advance since these flights seem to be so full! --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks - a nice start to the year.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I certainly follow your career with interest.  I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the wedding picture with your Christmas card.  What a great picture - you look beautiful and happy.  Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.  My best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.  Maybe next year...  I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.  I will see Mo tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.  See you next week!  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note on the promotion.  This was definitely a goal and is very rewarding to get there.  I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.  In fact, I mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.  He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).  I filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.  I am in the London office this week.  Call Patti and ask her to schedule  a time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk about rotations.   I will look forward to it.  Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and dinner (someplace downtown with heat -- any suggestions?).  Patti is working on some of the details this week for us to host Ted Jacobs and about 14 of his students while they are in town for NAPE.  --Sally 
 Let's try the last row window seat.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note on the promotion.  Patti is beginning to work on details for the 1/31 tour of Enron Field and dinner for Ted and his students from OU.  She should contact you for a list of recent OU grads so that we can get the invitation list together.  I hope that you have that date on your calendar!   I will ask MIke McConnell if he would like to join us, too. 
 Great - we will look forward to seeing you on the 13th and 14th.  I will work on an agenda this week, and will send you something later in the week. --Sally 
 Michelle:  This is a stab at something to include in the newsletter.  Will you or someone on your team rewrite as necessary?  I am in the London office this week, so e:mail is probably the best way to get in touch with me. Thanks.  --Sally Beck   Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across all commodities in 2001. 
 Thanks for you nice note.  I miss seeing you on 33.  Hope that all is going well for you.  --Sally     Susan Skarness 01/16/2001 09:07 AM 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I do hope that everyone on my team sees the promotion as recognition of the value of the roles that we perform.  All that should make it easier to attract and retain talented people that make my job easier and more fun!  I will ask Patti to schedule some time for us to get together when I am back in the office next Monday.  Have a good week.  ---Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that within my team that they see the promotion as an indication that the work that we do is recognized as meaningful.  All of that helps me in recruiting and retaining talented people that make my job easier and more fun! 
 Thanks for your nice note.  Haven't seen you in a while - hope that all is going well for you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I hope that things are going well for you at EBS.  I know that it must be busy.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.  What a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of EnronOnline.  --Sally 
 Had trouble finding your e:mail address the first time around for this memo. 
 I can access the global compensation system from London.  Today I have been able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday for bonus and LTI.  I assume that I will be able to access the screens for merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.  I will want to give my direct reports access to the system so that they can input their recommendations.  I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions and expectations.  Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have to request additional dollars for these worksheets.  Better not to ask for exceptions on everything!!!  What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted? Let me know.  If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where you can reach me.  Thanks. 
 I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the time to vote.  Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow.   For those employees who typically work later hours, please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office. Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count.  It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening. Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that you are having fun in your new role. We will have to schedule lunch so that I can catch up on what you are doing now.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I am pleased for all of us at the increased recognition of the roles that we play within the organizaiton.  My ability to do my job well is very dependent on those of you who play key roles in operations.  Thanks for your part in that and for your continued support. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note.  Yes, this definitely starts the year off nicely.  Hope your holidays were wonderful and that 2001 is a good year for you and your family, too.  --Sally 
 Patti:  Please forward this message to Tom Hopwood. =20  Tom:  The good (or bad) news was that I was here late enough to see the mem= o=20 come out on e:mail Friday night.  Most will see this on Tuesday after the= =20 holiday.  I did get a few calls tonight from a hardy few that were still he= re=20 in the office.  I will call you when I am back from London.  Thanks for all= =20 of your help this week on the two meetings.  --Sally=20 
 The promotional memo came out a few hours too late today for me to be able to mention it when we talked this afternoon.  Congratulations on your promotion to managing director!  --Sally 
 The promotional memo came out a couple of hours too late for me to be able to mention it to you on the phone this afternoon.  Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  I have the dubious honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of the promotional memo via e:mail.  I will be in the London office next week and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.  I look forward to the chance to visit with you then.  --Sally 
 Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London office during the week of January 15.  I will arrive just after lunch on Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.  Much of my time will be spent with Fernley and Mike Jordan.  If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.  I will stop by while I am in the office.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.  Well deserved, and a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of the Calgary office. --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President!  Well deserved and a nice way to cap off your stay in London.  I look forward to celebrating with you in London next week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule.  Hopefully, this will be fruitful for everyone.   And maybe unnecessary at some point in time!  Thanks.  -Sally 
 I will be working in the London office Monday through Thursday, January 15 - 18 and will be be flying back to Houston on Friday, January 19.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has a contact numbers for me in London. I will be checking voice mail and e:mail regularly while I am there.  Key contacts in Houston next week will be:  DPR and MPR   Shona Wilson   x39123  Gas Operations   Jeff Gossett    x37306 (in Chicago office Jan. 16 & 17) Bob Hall    x36956  Power Operations  Stacey White   x31870 Leslie Reeves   x37962 
 Cathy:  I will be working in the London office during the week of January 15, so I will not be at the staff meeting on January 16.  --Sally 
 I don't think that the doorstep reviews are the right venue for this.  I believe that to address what seems to be David's concerns would be better handled with an appropriate person deemed to lead a special project in a directed timeframe with a well defined scope.  We purposefully utilize differing personal on the doorstep reviews and it would seem that concerns over proper valuation should be addresses in a timeframe that is not dependent on the schedule of doorstep reviews around the world. 
 Please print attachment and make sure that e:mail addresses are included for the students.  Call Ted if any problems.  Thanks. We will need this to send invitations to students and Ted (plus some Enron folks) to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on January 31.  Let's talk about arranging details.  thanks. 
 Leslie:  Can you attend this meeting for me?  I will be in London.  Patti:  Can you get time and location for Leslie and let them know that she will be there instead of me?  Thanks. 
 Yes, just call Wanda and let her know that Rick has asked that we add EES Houston to the Doorstep review schedule.  In keeping with other reviews, I would not necessarily give Wanda the dates.  We should also send a short memo to Kevin and Marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the reviews.  I should probably send that to them.  Can you remind me when I am back in town the week of January 22?  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before, Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly welcome a conversation with you.  I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January 22.  -Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 It will be good to use your knowledge of the business in helping EIM to grow.  I hope that you enjoy your new rotation.  --Sally 
 I will be in London the week of January 15th.  I understand from Beth that you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.  Beth and I plan to have dinner that night.  Will you be back in town later in the week?  I have business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.  Could you make dinner on Wednesday night (the 17th)?  There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.  I have a belated Christmas gift for you.  Hope we can get together!  --Sally  PS  Am staying at 47 Park. 
 Please put details of this meeting on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 I told  Tom last week that I have a standing systems meeting on Thursdays at 9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.  Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday this week?  Thanks. --Sally 
 Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend. Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?  This will be a meeting that we should have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and make timely decisions on how to handle those.  I am sure that there is some prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.  I would assume that we should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk books, OA, etc.  Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.  I would love for us take charge and lead this meeting.  --Sally 
 There isn't much to the memo, but this is it!  It came out well after the e= nd=20 of the work day for most folks.  I believe that Patti has sent you my trave= l=20 plans for next week.  Have a great weekend!=20 
 Thanks for the note.  I certainly know by responses that I am getting tonight who is in the office late!  I was told that the memo would come out today - you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!  I am really pleased about how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and its importance to the organization.  And yes, we need more female names on these lists!  --Sally   Tana Cashion @ ENRON   01/12/2001 07:43 PM

 Your note has made my day.  Thanks for taking the time to send it.  Your thoughts and support mean a lot to me.  How lucky I am to have you for a sister and friend!  --Sally 
 Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for your schedule).  I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend. However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether or not you included that on your list.  Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned by Irma's son, Luis).  I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as well.  I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see at the end of January.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the responses -- all look great.  I like coming over knowing that my calendar will be pretty full.  Dinner sounds great, too.  I am having dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment. I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.  Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was smooth.  --Sally 
 I am glad that you asked!  I will be happy to bring your things back for you.  Niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while I am there next week and she is coordinating my schedule, so we see one another quite a bit.  It will be easy to do this.  --Sally 
 Let's plan on Monday night for dinner.  Someone included me on the distribution list for your going away bash, so I have put that on my calendar for Wednesday night as well.  --Sally 
 Thanks!  I understand that congratulations are in order for you, too.  We should definitely do dinner and celebrate.  I think that Niki has arranged that for Thursday night.  I will look forward to it.  --Sally 
 FYI - While I simply received an assessment from Jenny, there is obviously a listing of equipment that exists.  Looks as if Paige Cox on Jenny's team would be the person to get with on this.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  While the journey has been interesting, to say the least, I am very excited about what we can do and committed to the effort.  I am glad that we will be able to continue working together.  --Sally 
 This will be an important meeting for me to attend.  Let me know when this gets scheduled.  Thanks. 
 This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space in the new building.  You can take up the cause with Philippe when he returns.  I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space planning details.  I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will be reporting to you.  I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am.  --Sally 
 Here is another one... 
 Back on the calendar this afternoon with Andy Zipper to get his comments on the presentation - should be able to get you and John a copy following that meeting. 
 In re-reading this, I noticed that Todd Hall was included in the distribution list.  He is the only one from Brent's team included.  Do you want to copy Brent as well, or was Todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR, which now is managed by Susie Ayala.  Either way, you may want to include Brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive.  What about Georgeanne Hodges?  Should she be notified as well?  You may also want to copy Wes as an FYI.  Thanks. 
 Good idea.  Is there a way to monitor usage of this folder is insure that everyone has  read and complied with your message? 
 I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two "test runs" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday. 
 According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up in the air.  Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of Beth's arrival and Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for you. 
 I would recommend floor meetings on 37 (we occupy almost the entire floor) and on the operations end of floor 32.  That would cover everyone pretty well.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Patti will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.  We used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team.  I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done.  We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.  We also still have the two Terrace level tickets as we did last year.  For some games you will get all 6 tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace tickets.  Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history!  --Sally 
 Patti:  I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention later in April.  She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that.  So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days.  I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so no notation on time out of the office.  Thanks. 
 Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization.  We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment. 
 I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more than anything else.  --Sally 
 The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk  30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products)  31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams  32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis   37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally 
 Please put the 17th meeting on my calendar.  I may or may not attend, but want to have that on the calendar just in case.  Thanks. 
 This date change means that I won't be able to make it to the open house.  I will be out of town on April 27. 
 We'll see you the next time.  Thanks. 
 I have talked with Jeff Gossett, Leslie Reeves and Stacey White to let them know about the Saturday effort and the Sunday meeting.  They all will be in town this weekend and will be on call.    Their contact numbers are listed below:  Home Phone			Cell Phone  Jeff Gossett			281-358-7546*			713-825-6094		*Kingwood exchange - may be long distance Leslie Reeves		281-476-4408			713-907-6554  Stacey White		281-894-0468			281-382-5215  Sally Beck			281-370-8568			713-417-1591 or 713-299-1436  (Kim Theriot reports to Leslie, so she will talk with Kim.  I don't have contact numbers for Kim.) 
 LeMetrice is either a director or senior director under Jenny - kind of a second in command.  She worked extensively on the original 2002 budget for Infrastructure and put together some data on functions within the Infrastructure group that gave a somewhat layman's explanation of the various services provided.   We have already gone through the process of rebudgeting dollars and headcount for 2002, post bankruptcy and December 2 lay offs, and with the projected Netco spin off.  It is likely that LeMetrice has all of those details.  So despite a somewhat short answer from Jenny, she was actually on target to refer you to her.   -Sally 
 I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.  Greg and I talked about this today.  He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.  If he and his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer.  Thanks for your help.  --Sally 
 Would you like to be included?  We will try to start this next week.  I will ask Patti to get with you on the details.  --Sally 
 Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.  Thanks! 
 I was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to Neiman's.  Can you get that list form Vanessa?  Thanks. 
 Is it lunch or dinner on May 10? 
 Is this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for t= hem, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute = to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my cal= endar.  Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.  --Sally=20 
 What does "completed" mean?  My first request was to give me access to review all e-mail messages that Mary has received since March 1 through yesterday's date.  I asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my review process.  Has this been done?  I don't see any new messages that have been transferred from Mary's mail box to mine.  --Sally 
 Please print in color for me.  Do we have a file set up for these?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Imagining that for myself, it would not be a pretty site.  Was it just a lot of movement, or was there noise as well?  --Sally 
 In a meeting with Louise Kitchen today, she mentioned that Bob Superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the Peoples Energy Board of Directors on Wednesday.  She was very complimentary.  I have let Bob know about Louise's praise.  Thought that you would like to know as well.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples Energy Board this week.  Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).  We may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools. --Sally 
 Please print in color for me.  Thanks. 
 Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I wi= ll meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to "m= ass mail" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday after= noon or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vicke= rs and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and pow= er covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation i= n person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will like= ly come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presenta= tion could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sen= se to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the w= ord to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We = can start those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logi= stics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really t= hink that we need one.   =20  Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to de= liver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from= Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him = on that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and= will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with= her that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as= the other "out of towner" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the nex= t time that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April= 17, 18 or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with hi= m perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west= power risk team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetin= gs here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I ca= n discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentatio= ns at lunch tomorrow. =20  I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage= and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally=20 
 Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:  Gas			Frank Vickers (East) Laura Luce (Central) Barry Tycholiz (West)  Derivatives		Fred LaGrasta  Power		Dave Duran Ozzie Pagan Ed Baughman Bruce Shuckley  Portland		Chris Calger  Calgary		Ladain  Mexico		Max Y.  When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally 
 I didn't read through all of the names, but wanted to make sure that we are= including Beth Apollo on invites to participate in recruiting.  I think th= at I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after= spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity = and worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great= to have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has = another preference that is great, too.  If she is not on your list yet, why= don't you call her for an introduction and give her the rundown on the sch= ools that you are responsible for so that she can make a choice.  Thanks.  = --Sally=20 
 Thanks for the info on the recruiting expo.  Sounds like fun, but I won't b= e able to make it.  I am taking the day off on Friday, April 13th to take M= eagan for her info session and tour at UT.  We will be driving to Austin af= ter she gets out of school on Thursday afternoon, April 12. =20  You know that you can count me in already as a team member!  --Sally=20 
 Thanks for the update.  I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.  She is the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want to get her feedback as well.  --Sally 
 Great idea to run this by Louise.  She ususally has some good ideas on how things should look and feel online.  I would love to see it, too.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.  Thanks in advance for you help on this. 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?  2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response."  3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box.  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter. 
 Per my memo below, please enroll Brenda Herod, James Scribner, Thresa Allen and Shona Wilson for the May session.  Thanks for the reminder and for your help!  --Sally 
 The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution. Thanks. 
 Is this on Vanessa's update list?  Are users happy with the results? 
 Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that. 
 FYI - Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Tight time frame for Mike & co. on metals deliverables.  Raises the question around the timing of next week's visit on metal.  Will we divert critical resources from these efforts.   --Sally 
 It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 
 I am following up with someone that was on Mary's team that now works for Beth Apollo.  We will get back with you on this shortly.  --Sally 
 Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --Sally 
 Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their = assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback fro= m the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it= would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer = so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums througho= ut the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summe= r?  It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  = I will be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.=20 
 I will be in the office the whole week of April 9.  I will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 30 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews.  --Sally 
 Sally has arranged Brian Wood with Avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow (Wednesday), April 4, 1:00 -2:00 PM.  Brian will meet at Sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the Enron Building for demonstration.  If you are interested in attending, please call me at x39106 so I can give Brian a headcount.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please ask Sheri Thomas if this person needs access to EOL applications.  I don't recognize the names.  The name noted as manager is Loyd Will, who is a commercial employee reporting to Kevin Presto.  Thanks. 
 Please put these dates on my calendar and let Lexi know that at this point = the calendar is open and that I will be happy to participate in both the in= formation session and the interviews.  Thanks. =20 
 I was at the pre-seasoner opener at Enron Field last Friday night and saw you throw the first pitch.  It was a nice one - never a chance of it hitting the dirt!  -Sally 
 Thanks for putting this together.  I will look forward to reading the details later today. --Sally 
 Can you print this for me?  Thanks. 
 You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!  I suppose that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two months away.  I will be glad to handle invitations.  I will look for some this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.  Cara had sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.  I still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.  I will call you tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home.  --Sally 
 Exactly!  Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna.  I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.  I see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is?!?  --Sally 
 Looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion... 
 That was my third or fourth time at Ibeza - I have enjoyed it each time.  It is a great place for outside dining when the weather works for that.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.  --Sally 
 Resume attached per my voice mail to you.  This guy is currently at Compaq, but wants to do something else.  Any interest?  As I said in my voice mail, I will be glad to call my friend Dave Schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like.  --Sally 
 TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations  Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.  Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.  There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.  The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:  Business Unit	HR Contact	Phone# EGM 	David Hill	713/853-4218 EIM	Kathy Neal	713/345-7803 EA/Global Services	Frank De Jesus	713/345-3662 EA/Global Services	Hector McLoughlin	713/853-6703  Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services. 
 Gwynn,  Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something - if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.  Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and commodity operations.  Patti x39106 
 FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly.  --Sally 
 Please approve. 
 I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:  1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or  2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week. 
 Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks. 
 We will get you back on the official distribution list.  For now, I am forwarding our weekly report to you.  --Sally 
 I would like to have my directors and senior directors take this course.  There is just one course date noted in the attachment in May.  Will there be other dates during the year?  I can't have everyone go at the same time.  I would like to get the list of dates in 2001 and then send a memo to directors and senior directors requiring them to attend one of the sessions.  Can you also get me a list of the director and senior directors that I have in EIM, EGM and EA?  Will this course also be offered in London for directors?  --Sally 
 1)  Did you add to the numbers that Jeff and I reviewed with you on Sunday?  You had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates - did you do that?  UBS was asking me about numbers today, and I wanted to be consistent with the answers.  2)  What about Calgary?  You were going to ask Rob M. to have Peggy Hedstrom coordinate over the weekend.  Didn't hear from her.  Are you handling this through Rob?  Or do you want me to include Calgary operations in the final org chart for Netco Operations?  --Sally 
 Good response, Bob.  Thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting.  --Sally 
 FYI - See attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the "ill-defined".  If this is not on target, we will keep working until it is!  - Sally 
 All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally 
 Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally 
 Bob,  Sally is out all day w/ UT recruiting function.  She will not be back into the office until 8:00 Thursday for CommodityLogic meeting.  I am forwarding this to Bob Hall - please check with him regarding how he would like this handled.  Thanks, PT 
 In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic.  Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist  User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and 		Financial Settlements  Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic  NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations) ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations)   Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.  In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic. 
 Thanks for your list.  I will add these to our Hot List.  Let me know about the A/R.  Thanks.  Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.  --Sally    Peggy Hedstrom 03/26/2001 01:54 PM 
 FYI - sounds as if Michelle is accepting.  Do you have anything firm from her?  --Sally 
 FYI  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one. 
 Frank & Hector,  Here is the list of contractors that Kymberly sent Sally - please compare to list from Peggy McCurley that Sally gave you last week.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 1)  I believe that Tom Martin is talking with Chris Germany about taking the logistics role for the Texas region with Daren's planned departure.  Please coordinate with Tom and Bob Superty on where they are in this process of replacing Daren.  2)  I am not sure that I know what database you are referencing.  He is on the current proposed org chart for Netco Energy Operations under Operational Databases (part of the Documentation team).  It is correct that his name is on the list that I provided to you yesterday.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  --Sally 
 I am so glad that you will be able to interview.  I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron.  --Sally 
 Bob & Leslie,  Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your availability.  2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.  I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 2nd meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I will be in New York on business on March 30th.  Sorry that I will not be = able to attend.  The other person that I would send in my place is Beth Apo= llo.  However, she will be on vacation next week.  Can you give me any info= that may be made available?  Thanks. =20 
 Here is Rick's response - sounds more like a concern on his part on losing people and some of their reasons cited for leaving.  Do you know who has left? 
 Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.  Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.  This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of 		record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)  Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of 			transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)  Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth 		Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on 		ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting) 
  FYI 
 I enjoyed lunch, too.  Glad you included Kristin.  When do Jo and the kids leave for England?  We should try to have lunch with our gangs before then.  Let me know.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the invitation.  I will be out of town April 25 through 27, so unfortunately I will have to miss the game.  --Sally 
 Please put this on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks.  --Sally 
 Glad you followed up - I don't know why you would have been deleted, but I am glad that is straightened out. I will look for the feedback form via e-mail.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you liked the pictures.  We would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.  If you thought it would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner together.  I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday night before heading to Amanda's recital.  Then you could make your drive back on Wednesday after breakfast. Whatever works for you will be great, though.  I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League National meeting.  Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.  My Thursday night is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.  She lives in Whittier, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.  I know that we will have a good time catching up. 
 We have set Monday, June 11 for the date of our Operations PRC that will include employees that are supporting ENA, EGM and EIM.  You mentioned that your functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.  It would certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your functional PRC.  While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operations during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations.  I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC meeting in setting the date for your meeting.  Please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your PRC.  Thanks. 
 Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team)  You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.  My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Causey.  In that meeting we review director level and above.  Rick has not set the date for that meeting. 
 I always like to heart good news.  I can't say that I have been deluged with examples since that meeting in January.  I will ask Patti to set up a meeting sometime this week for us to get together.  --Sally 
 I can't say that this will make me sad to lose this job.  Enjoy it!  --Sally 
 I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe tha= t person could shed light on this for both of us.=20  There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the= name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn'= t match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if t= hat is where this is coming from?  Norma (whose last name I don't know) who= works for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC na= me that was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously = seem to relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported = in through Operations.  When I asked Norma to read me the names of employee= s in that RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.  I told her that we ha= d not used the term "IBS" in a while.  Norma asked if the RC name should be= consistent with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes s= ense and she said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a= name change, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this inf= o gets us back on the right track.  --Sally=20 
 I will keep you posted on time and location for the meeting on the 11th.  If you join us for discussions on VP's, we will review Brent Price, Bob Hall, Peggy Hedstrom and Beth Apollo.  If you want to sit in on review of senior directors, that would pick up Leslie Reeves, James Scribner, Brenda Herod, Kevin Sweeney and Sheila Glover.  --Sally 
 Enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago.  At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.  I understand from Ted Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs.  You might check with Lexi Elliot (one of the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs.  If we have more jobs than interns, then Lexi could help in the process of interviewing Debbie for a position.  My last conversation with Ted Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with Lexi.  --Sally 
 On PRC:  In the next few days, I will be able to give Tina an idea on the time when we will start Senior Directors in the June 11th meeting and we will keep you posted that day on timing.  Contracts:  I met this morning with Robert Jones and Ryan Seleznov on contracts for Brent and Bob.  They were going to get with Michelle Cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day. (Legal has their offsite starting Wednesday, so we will be out of luck for legal help after today.)  I will keep you posted.  I believe that these new contracts will be well received.  Q2 Goals:  Patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and Philippe for next Monday at 3:00.  --Sally 
  Let's coordinate on needs for confirmations and settlements.  Can someone on your team specify what their needs will be?  Then we can determine the best method to obtain the machines.  I will have copies of the floor plans for 5 and 6 sometime this morning -- we should determine best placement for these.  --Sally 
 Did the numbers that we gave you yesterday on Operations hold up after your meeting with UBS?  Amy Fitzpatrick is calling me to get names.  Our primary focus yesterday was on number of positions.  We identified names in most cases, but not all.  Before that is finalized and I pass names along to Amy, I wanted to know if we were okay with the numbers.   Please let me know.  Names can be finalized this afternoonis we are set on numbers.  --Sally x35926  Cell:  713-417-1591 
 FYI --- 
 Thanks for copying me on Michael Brown's note.  Brenda Herod flew to London last night and should be in the London office today.  I am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this.  She and I visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in London for the pulp and paper effort.  So as to not steal her thunder, it will suffice to say that I am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing EGM model.  --Sally 
 Please approve this request.  Brent Price is my direct report and is responsible for the RC's included in this request.  Thanks.  --Sally Beck 
 I have put the staff meeting referenced at the bottom of John's message on my calendar.  Please check with Kim on the location and as to whether or not future dates are set.  Also, please check to see if date for offsite has been set.  We are trying to schedule a vacation, and it would help to know the dates of the offsite.  Thanks. 
 FYI - 
  Please see if you can get this to print so that I get all of the info.  I tried it 100 times on Friday and could only one page to print, which did not include all of the information.  Thanks.  NEED THIS TODAY. 
 You are welcome to attend any of these.  In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.  Do get with Jeff and Stacey before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.  PATTI:  Please add Beth to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.  Thanks. 
 We are planning a meeting with the teams lead by Meredith,  Mark Evans and Mary Lynne Ruffner this afternoon - you should be getting information from Meredith shortly with time and location.  During that meeting we will clarify this memo for everyone.  --Sally 
 At the end of my 3:00 meeting with Philippe and Greg today I will get clarification about the international travel.  It is hard for me to believe that Philippe or Beth Perlman or Greg Piper will fly coach to London.  I will keep you posted.  -Sally 
 FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by RAC.  I don't think that RAC needs to have approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on EOL with the approved trader list.  This may be part of your process.  If not, it probably should be incorporated.  Then you may want to educate the RAC team on your approval process.  Let me know if you need and help or support from me.  Hope that all is well.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on a job done well in a short period of time.  Your note of thanks to everyone was a nice one.   I am sure that the team appreciates your leadership.  --Sally 
 Thanks for copying me on this note.  I have sent a suggestion to Sheri and asked her to respond to Frank  Hayden.  --Sally 
 Good solution - and you are right, this falls under our normal Educational Assistance program.  Thanks for the update.  --Sally 
 The name that I couldn't remember when we spoke yesterday if Geoffrey Mann - Americas CEO.  Accompanying him will be Jim Martino from the Austin office.  They will be here at 9:00 and I will have them come to the 33rd floor and I will meet with them for a few minutes.  Then I can call you and walk them to wherever you are going to meet with them.  Again, thanks for making this work for your schedule.  Business decisions about what Viviance can provide for you are clearly yours.  I do appreciate your willingness to give them your time and a fair "audience".  I know that my sister is very bullish on the quality of the product that they deliver. 
 I look forward to seeing you again on Thursday morning and to meeting Mr. Mann.  You will need to check in at the front desk in the lobby.  Usually, the process is that they will call to let me know that you are here.  My extention is 35926.  You will get a visitors badge and then you will go to the 33rd floor.  There is a reception area on 33.  I will meet you there.  --Sally Beck 
 Your list looked good and I approved all as reviewers.  We can talk about how the VP PRC process works - there will be an opportunity there to provide info to various commercial MD's that will be in attendance at the meeting.  We will make sure that we prepare the attendees well.  --Sally 
 Thanks for joining us for dinner last week.   It was good to see you again as well.  I hope that your temporary move to Houston goes smoothly.  Please call me with a contact number for you this summer.  We can get together while you are in town for your summer internship.  --Sally 
 I know that the timing on choosing these interns was short.  Thanks for responding back to Jana so quickly.  And now most of them will be here next Monday!  Please be certain that you and your assistant are actively working on a location, phone and computer (with necessary access granted) for these interns.  I want to be certain that all interns have a very positive introduction to working at Enron.  This list excludes those that will assigned to EGM under Brent Price and his team.  As soon as I get an updated list from Jana, I will schedule a meeting for this week so that we can discuss how we will make the internships a success this summer.  All ideas will be welcome, so get creative before coming to the meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I want to keep track of summer interns.  Please make me a desk file.  This list is missing summer interns under Brent.  I have asked Jana to send me an updated list.  I have also sent her a message letting her know that Sheri Thomas now reports into Andy Zipper and that she needs to communicate with Sheri and Andy directly regarding Greg Carlson's internship.  Also, did you keep copies of resumes of the analysts?  Can you pull resumes for the interns that will be assigned to us?  I would like to review them.  I also want to hold a meeting later this week with all supervisors who will have interns reporting to them.  Please check with the listed supervisor on Jana's list.  If one of their direct reports will actually be the primary supervisor, please get that name.  Thanks. -Sally 
 FYI 
 Could I be included in these update meetings?  Rather than read the material after the fact and have you review it with me separately, it seems that it would make sense for me to be included in the update meeting that you hold with Rick.  Assuming that Rick is comfortable with that, can we do that going forward?  If all agree, please ask your assistant to let me know if a date has already been set for the next update.  Thanks.  . 
 Happy for Hector and Laura to attend.  --Sally 
 Please print atttachment for me.  Thanks. 
 Here are the two for Brent.  Please get copies of resumes from Jana.  Please set up a meeting for later this week with all who will be supervisors of interns.  Include Brent as well.  Thanks.  (thirty minutes will be fine) 
  Let's talk about this one.  _sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I have sent a message to Beth Apollo, who is James' supervisor.  Beth is out for the next two days, and will return to the office on Wednesday.  I will make sure that Beth and James make a point of talking with you about this opportunity.  --Sally 
 You may want to consider her.  We can discuss.  --Sally 
 I regret that I will miss the first Global Accounting Steering Committee Meeting on Tuesday, May 15.  I am taking that day as a vacation day while my parents are in Houston for Amanda's piano recital.  I will be in attendance at the next two meetings in May - the 22nd CAO Meeting and the 29th Steering Committee Meeting. 
 I will be out of the office on Tuesday, May 15.  I am taking a vacation day while my parents will be in town for my daughter's piano recital.  Patti (x39106) has cell and home numbers where I can be reached.  I will be back in the office on Wednesday, May 16. 
 Please print attachment in color.  Also print all other recent e:mails from Mechelle.  Thanks. 
 It was a pleasure to meet you last week when you were in Houston.   You arrived with a some good advance "press" from Cindy, all of which was well founded.  I am glad that your meeting with Tom was fruitful and I am pleased that there may be a fit between Enron's needs and Vivance's offerings.  I know that Cindy is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.  I have e-mailed JIm Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.  While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.  Let me know when you will be back in Houston.  If you like Mexican food, I can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal.  --Sally 
 Here is agenda for Causey's offsite next week.  I told Sharron that you would be in town and she said that you (and Anna) would certainly be welcome for all or part of the day.  FYI - the location for this meeting is at the Adams Mark Hotel.  This is not very close to downtown - would require a car or cab.  I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which things you would like to attend.  My thoughts are that I will not attend for the entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office.  Let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.  --Sally 
 June 12 works well for me.  It is likely that we will be on vacation on Friday, June 22.  My husband is finalizing airline reservations today, and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on Friday, June 22 rather than Saturday, June 23.  --Sally 
 I remember you well, Christine, from the recruiting process.  I would love to visit with you to catch up on what you have done at Enron to date and to talk with you about a rotation in my group.  By copy of this memo, I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to get together.  I look forward to seeing you.  --Sally 
 Peggy:  I will be at the meeting at 12:00, but will need to leave around 12:30 for a meeting with someone from London.  Our schedules wouldn't allow for any other time for us to get together, and I have some critical things to review regarding London.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the details on the flowers.  That should be enough for us to produce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer.  David must have had a brain lapse - he forgot to mention that you had called.  Meagan and I were probably at the Bearkadette officers meeting at the time.  We really enjoyed your visit as well!  Thanks for supporting Amanda in her musical efforts.  --Sally 
 We  need to talk. 
 Do you want my help in preparing something for Paul?  Would you like me to go with you when you meet with Paul? 
  Can you print the attachment for me?  Thanks. 
 The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the close date to July 1).  Brian Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close.  Bob Hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.  As I explained earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in June.  After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to June 1.  The effort on our part should diminish substantially after June 30. 
 What do we do with this?  I logged in, but couldn't tell what to do.  --Sally 
 I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you= to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that= I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously play= ed by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscor= e the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my = operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping = my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can ha= ve an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once= in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over= gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  = Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be = out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the righ= t players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact = Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your = support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within= operations.  --Sally 
 I have left John a message about the e-mail.  No response yet.  Will call Leslie, Stacey and Jeff as soon as I finish breakfast. 
  Can you print attachment for me?  Thanks. 
 The deadline has been extended by HR until Tuesday, so that many of us can work on these reviews over the weekend.  You should see more responses early next week.  --Sally 
 Informational for me, or do you want me to attend?  If you don't want me to attend, would you like for me to review the presentation that you plan to give?  --Sally 
 My first and second choices on speaking engagements are listed below:  1st choice	MG906		Wed, July 11	Who Moved My Cheese?  2nd choice	MG909		Fri., July 13	Leading Your Firm Through Change  Frank and Hector have been on point for further participation in the conference and would be best to visit with about use of other passes to the conference.  Wes Colwell has co-sponsored our involvement in this conference.  Are the four passes intended to cover his group, too?  --Sally 
 Glad that the two of you could make the trip to Houston this week.  Hopefully, your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts.  I Anna, I will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities.  Mike, I will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite (late Oct) and on likely dates for my next trip to London.  I enjoyed the shopping and dinner.  --Sally 
 Patti is sending you my slides for the offsite - I finally got out of meetings long enough to review them!  There will be four parts to the Mid/Back Office hour and a half on the agenda:  Global Risk Management Operations - Overview of Services (Beck providing slides)  IT Systems - Overview and Organization (Perlman providing slides) )  CommodityLogic Modules (Gros providing slides)  Commercialization Effort (the three of us are working on a few slides - to come later today) 
 Change in plans - Patti will send slides for both me and Beth.  She is formating info from Beth's assistant into format that I used for my slides, so you will get these as one presentation.  (Patti has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.)  I think that you already have slides from Tom on CommodityLogic.  We are working on a few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon as we can.   Thanks, Tina. --Sally 
 There is another Senior Director in London in Operations - Anna McAndrew.  She was just joined Enron in April, and I was unsure of her title.  Confirmed that this morning. 
 What is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special to the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't know enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for $60?  Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, anyway.  You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in full force for later life -- only kidding!) --Sally 
  Please put this date on my calendar and let Lexi know that I will be glad to attend.  Thanks. 
 John:  I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.  We  need some questions answered first to go through this:  1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.  2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?  4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?  5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?  We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.  --Sally

 Evan has close to 300 people reporting to him.  The largest segment is the service management team.  My understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers.  We will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale, and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions.  I don't think we are in danger of getting Mark back.  --Sally 
 Kristin, I know that we would like to get together with you to discuss UT recruiting.  The easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work.  My assistant is Patti Thompson (x39106) and Rick's assistant is Sharron Westbrook.   By copy of this note, I will ask  Patti to coordinate with Sharron and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that Rick and I could get with you.  -Sally 
 Please coordinate with Sharron on Rick's schedule and get back with Kristin to set up a meeting. Thanks. --Sally 
 Please print color versions of attachments, along with black and white of Anna's cover note.  Thanks. 
 Please print attachment for me.  Thanks. 
  FYI 
 I printed copies of this resume the day that I received it from you.  I met with Beth Perlman that day and gave her the resume in person.  I also called Philippe Bibi and sent him a copy of the resume.  I am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy Robert Jones on this resume.  Robert heads up HR for Enron Net Works.  Feel free to give Beth, Philippe and Robert a call to add your personal comments about the candidate.  --Sally 
 What do you think?  I have never been crazy about the Commercial Support tag myself.  Do you like professional services?  Or do you have another suggestion.  Please send me your comments within the next day or so.  I would like to get back to David Oxley soon.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Got your note.  I am not incredibly attached to Commercial Support and I agree that overall it probably sounds second class.   Professional Services sounds fine to me.  I have forwarded your message to a handful of my direct reports to get their comments - Bob Hall, Brent Price, Beth Apollo and Peggy Hedstrom.  I should hear back from them today, and I will pass along any pertinent comments.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 You have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization to support wholesale, but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized.  We have had meetings about specific issues, but have not generally discussed how we will manage the Estate going forward.  What role do you envision that I will play?  Can you make time to discuss that on Monday?  I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activities) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources.   With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams' efforts.  I will be glad to share that with you as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs.  --Sally 
 Greg Piper and Robert Jones are aware that I will be on vacation on the date of the PRC meeting.  --Sally 
 Thanks.  We will add Greg to the list and will get back with him on details.  -Sally 
 Sorry to hear about your grandmother.  Funerals, oddly enough, seem to create opportunities to catch up with other family members.  Nice to see everyone, you are just sorry about the catalyst for bringing you together.  I will talk with you soon.  --Sally 
 We may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function.  We had a lunch meeting with John Lavorato, Dave Delainey, Wes, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (Evan Hughes) under EES.  Final decision expected this week.  --Sally 
  Bob Hall says Professional Services is fine - "change is good", as he said.  Brent's other suggestions are below.  I agree with you - simply changing the label doesn't do a whole lot.  Actions will speak louder than words.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the follow up.  --sally 
 We will be in Telluride the last week in June for vacation.  Any suggestions on where we should eat?  Think 17, 12 and 3 (children's ages).  Thanks!  --Sally 
 FYI - as we get closer to quarter end, it may help your DPR team to know about any pending deals that could be done close to quarter end.  --Sally 
 As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926) 
 I understand from Greg that he got a little more direction from Paul about the Calpine meeting that has been moved to Thursday morning.  Please send Beth Perlman and me a copy of the revised draft of the meeting document that you are preparing, in addition to Tom.  Thanks. 
 Where are we on decisions on promotions?  Last time I asked, it was under consideration.  Kevin has a good idea here.  Can you give us an update?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Another opinion.  I read Barry's response from EBS.  Not a lot of overwhelming sentiment for Professional Services.  Since this in only a term used in the PRC process, I don't know that a name change at this point would make much of a difference.  Let me know is decided.  --Sally 
 I didn't have an opening that looked quite right for Dan's experiece.  I have, however, given has resume to Tom Gros who has been leading CommodityLogic and is also paired with Beth Perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services.  In this effort, it is likely that Tom will to put together a marketing team.  I suggested that he consider Dan for one of those positions. 
 FYI - I will fill you in on the meeting this afternoon and will get you a copy of whatever we review.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 I left individual voice mail messages for Chris, Johnny, John, Tom, Keith, Susan and Susie tonight, thanking them for spending part of their Saturday in the office.  I appreciate your personal organization and leadership of the team so that the DPR could be completed Saturday morning and delivered to RAC for their further analysis over the weekend.  Thanks, too, for spending part of your weekend in the office.  Your willingness to pitch in and your constructive suggestions on leading and motivating employees is very much appreciated. 
 Trading activity on EnronOnline continues be at or above trade count levels for the same period last month.  Jim Donnell, President and CEO of Duke Energy North America, stated at an industry conference on Friday, October 26 that for Duke it is "business as ususal" with Enron.  Enron remains an active counterparty trading with Duke.  At the same Independent Petroleum Association of Amercia industry event, Joe Bob Perkins, group president for Reliant Energy's wholesale businesses, stated that Reliant continues to actively trade with Enron as well. 
 Will do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.  Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.  What would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --Sally 
 Since you are the lead, I assume that you have an idea from Dave on what he is looking for.  Since Dave referenced ENW, I assume that we will include roles with regard to IT development projects.  Do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of Infrastructure roles as well?  --Sally 
 Anything we can do on this?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series of breakfast meetings: (example noted below from today's meeting)  Name			Title		Group 				Direct Supervisor   Jeff Gossett		Director		Operations - Gas Risk (EA)	Bob Hall  La Metrice Dopson	Sr. Director	IT Infrastructure			Jenny Rub    Mark, Greg and I need to have this information the day before the scheduled breakfast meeting.  The group description may be the most difficult to get, but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within ENW and what they do.  I will be glad to help you with the details - just let me know.   Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization.  I would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning.  Thanks.  --Sally  Can I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings?  The list that I used last week for Senior Directors and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.  I just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.  Thanks. 
 Operator error - I misspelled your name.  Probably too late to include.  Sorry, I didn't see the failed delivery attempt until today.  Been kind of hectic at Enron!  --Sally 
 Please do the same thing with e-mails from MIke Jordan.  thanks. 
 I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.  Please check all to see if they have been approved.  From this point forward, I don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.  Please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to forward to you for you to check.  Please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted.  Thanks.  Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from Melissa relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from Melissa.  Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for Houston's Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from Marilyn Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.  This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 FYI...Sally 
 Approval still needed?  I do want to review anything at this point.  -Sally 
 Only a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!   The artickale was great.  In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports.  Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked.  I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for upcoming articles.  Sounds as if your son had a strong start at Kleb as well.  This second six weeks is proving to be a little more challenging for Amanda - or her effort may have gotten diverted!  I am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calendar.  --Sally 
 Need to use this in contact list that I believe Tina put together for ENW. 
 approval still needed? 
 I am just a little tardy in working my way through e-mails!  I understand that you will be joining Beth Apollo's risk team in EES soon.  A win-win situation for everyone involved, I believe.  Please let me know when you will next be in town - would love to see you.  --Sally 
 Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed.  I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues.  I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.  I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that I had not known before.  Seems like a good group.  --Sally 
 Approval still required?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  --Sally  (I do want to see all of these right now) 
 Yes, it has only taken me 23 days to respond, but yes I would like to get this report.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 In case you missed this, just wanted you to see that this Enron Net Works publication that to date has focused only on the IT organization has now been broadened in scope.  The hot link to the site should work, and if you click on Features and then Energy Operations you will see the article referred to below.  The editor has spoken to a couple of you also.  Her plan is to get with each one of you and to run a series of articles about Operations.  --Sally 
 Let's save this in case I have to send out something to all management committee members.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Cleaning out e-mails.  Does this still need approval?  --Sally 
 Yes - at 3:40 pm.  Will try to leave by 4:00 or so.  --Sally 
 Thanks for finding this!  I have printed it on a color copier, so I will have it with me as an example - am actually pretty close to being finished.  Had a fun visit with Cara and Anna.  What a cutie Anna is!  And what a good baby - still haven't heard a cry, or at least not one like my kids could produce!  They left after breakfast this morning, while most of us were at church.  Meagan stayed home to work on essays for college applications.  So sorry to hear about the car wreck.  Glad that you two are okay, but what an inconvenience.  Hope that the other guys insurance covers everything.  --Sally 
 Declines in Houston and replacements are noted below:  Declined				Replaced by  Chris Chang (Financial Settlements)		Gordon Heaney  Kelli Little (Gas Risk Management)		Matt Olney  Anna Kulic (Gas Risk Management)		Monte Jones  Susan Scott (Gas Scheduling)			Shannon Groenwald  I do not have updated information on acceptances or declines from Portland or Calgary Operations at this time. --Sally 
 I worlked with Jeff Gosset, Stacey White and Bob Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  Tana Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  I mentioned to Tana that letters had been given to both Jeff Gossett and Bob Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have Jeff covered, but with the change in Bob Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  Tana was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that Bob Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.  Next week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.  Wanted you to see my reply to Fernley below.  --Sally 
 Please see exchange below.  Can you send me current plans - who, when, where and what - for London reviews?  I would put a several day moratorium on contacting London regarding upcoming Doorstep review plans until I get back with you.  Thanks.  --Sally  I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.  What happened to that effort?  Sounds as if from the London e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world. 
 In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.  Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally 
 I won't sent this to you daily, but this is what we are providing to Treasury each day.  FYI --Sally 
 Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied Bob Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --Sally 
 Let's talk tomorrow about how we get everyone on the ball and thinking. 
  Please print attachement on cashflows for me - then delete my e-mail.  Thanks. 
 Please print message and attachment for me.  Thanks.  --Sally (then message can be deleted)

 Data only:  Enron Board met this morning; afternoon management committee meeting had been planned for today beginning at 2:30; that afternoon session postponed; short meeting with management committee was held an hour ago.  Call me later if you want details.  --Sally 
 I won't be able to attend the meeting on Friday.   I have an eye doctor's appointment at 9:30, so it is also unlikely that I will be able to call in, unless I am pleasantly surprised and he is running on time!  I will take the dial in number with me to the appointment in the event that I am somewhere in the process that allows me to dial in.  --Sally 
  In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --Sally 
 I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by Bob Superty.  Bob is the director of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader Enron Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.  You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.  Your thoughts?  --Sally 
 I got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch  - our list of senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.  I thought that Murray was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.  I asked Christina to verify his title and to find out if he was in Houston this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.  Does he report to you?  Hope that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.  --Sally 
 Didn't notice this e-mail yesterday!! --Sally 
 I am so glad that you joined us for dinner, as well.  I noticed that the Dean jokingly said that the scholarship checks were "in the mail".  The University does send those checks to the students, so please let me know if you have not received that.  It was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner.  Please keep me posted on your plans after graduation.  Sally Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 EIM's budget meeting with Lay/Whalley/Frevert has been moved from Wednesday, October 24 to Monday, November 5.  Kerry Roper sent you an e-mail message today with revised dates for budget reviews.  McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).  I am coordinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.  Kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to EIM.  They will okay the current EOL allocation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology.  Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.  When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the intent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday.  Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.  I suggested that on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subject to final sign-off) for EIM.  The footnote should also say final reviews with EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business units are still preliminary.  I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Whalley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions since our review with Whalley 10 days ago.  --Sally 
 If you can make a call from where you are, let mw know and I will give you a download on both the all-employee meeting and our lunch meeting.  --Sally  Feel free also to call me during my commute home tonight (613-417-1591) or at home tonight (281-370-8568).  Happy birthday tomorrow! --Sally 
 Pumpkin recipe dip attached.  Absolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next year.  Perhaps you would consider being the official Editor for next year?  That is the job that you are really doing!  Meagan sent her application in to OU today.  It's one of four schools to which she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.  But it is nice to get one out the door!  --Sally  My assistant is faxing the two pages regarding news from national. 
 I will mail the checks and money to Barb.  There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed "filler".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the recipe in my briefcase.  Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!  At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.  Had planned to drop that off as well.  I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later.  Thanks again for all of your hard work!!! --Sally 
 Information forwarded below indicates that through October 22, we have not seen a drop off in deal counts executed through EnronOnline for derivatives trading.  Please let me know if you need additional information.  --Sally Beck (x35926) 
 Robin:  Several people gave me ad requests for the November newsletter.  I have had a crazy day at the office - should actually have been travelling to OU to interview students today.  Here are the ad contents.  I will try to call you on my way home and see if it is convenient to drop by the forms and the money.  In case I miss you, here are the contents:     Ashley Stone  Congratulations on being voted "Wittiest" at Klein. We always knew you were!  Love, Mom, Dad and Stefani  _________________________________   Congratulations!  Pam Martin National Merit Commended Student  Love, Mom and Dad  _________________________________  Happy 17th Birthday  Kim (her mom didn't put a last name, but we may want to - I am blank, she is the daughter of Barbara ??????, our historian)  With love and friendship' Vivian and Lori Young  _________________________________  Happy 13th Birthday  Chelsey Klingsporn (check spelling of name in directory - her mom paid for ad, but did not fill out a pink slip) Love, Mom and Dad  _________________________________   Other newsletter items:  Nancy Ramsey wanted to mention that sympathy goes out to Theresa and (her daughter's name?) on the death of their mother-in-law and grandmother  There will be a food drive for TEAM and NAM at the December tea - Claire Loria was to check with philanthropy chairs to find out if certain items would be needed by the TEAM and NAM food pantries - did she send you that detail?  --Sally 
 713-417-1591  It's about 6:45 pm right now - I need to spend 15 minutes or so on open items on my desk, then I will be headed home.  Commute takes about 35 minutes this time of night.  Try me in the car about 7:15 pm tonight and I can fill you in during my commute.  Feel free to call me at home tonight as well.  Best after 9:30 pm - 281-370-8568.  Other option will be during my commute tomorrow morning.  Try me in the car about 7:15 am.  --Sally 
 I will be at the Hyatt tomorrow for the all-employee meeting and I hope that each one of you will plan to attend as well.  Certainly with current press coverage and market reaction last week and today, there will be many questions for Ken, Greg and Mark to address tomorrow.  It will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of ENW to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting.  To provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting, I invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ECS 4990 beginning at 12:00 noon.  This will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have.  It will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams.  --Sally  Please let Christina Valdez know today (x39106 or e-mail) if you will be at lunch on Tuesday so that we can place an order. 
 This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for the same time last month.  We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.    Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.  I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since Mark and Greg are both travelling, I think that it is important to both Ken Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I discussed this with Greg Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.  Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?  I need to send a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.  Beth Perlman suggested that we included Senior Directors and above.  Are you two okay with this?  --Sally 
 Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Let me know if I can help.  --Sally 
 Do you want to have Jenny Rub join us for this budget meeting to review IT Infrastructure costs?  She owns that piece of the ENW budget.  Let me know.  Another option is that Anthony and I could cover those costs, with the option to contact Jenny if more detail is required.  --Sally 
 I am going to miss the reception on Sunday evening and interviews on Monday.  I will arrive on Monday night and will interview on Tuesday.  Look forward to seeing you then.  --Sally 
 Thanks, Jeff.  I will get you more info for you and your team in early November.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the info, Bob.  I will get you more details on the tournament in early November.  --Sally 
 I will be there.  I will fill you and Mark in on what we hear.  --Sally=20 
 Is this for all assistants within ENW?  How many are there?  I would certainly be glad to split the cost with Mark and Greg.  --Sally 
 Since I was undecided on this meeting, I did not RSVP.  You may have alread= y done so for me.  I do want to let them know that I plan to attend now.  T= hanks.  --Sally=20  I do see Piper on the invitation list. =20 
 To give you more free time on the weekend...  Shona:  Does this impact you?  Does anyone in your group plan to be in over the weekend? 
 RE:  Golf Tournament at Ravenaux Country Club, Monday, November 19th 11:00 am Registration and Range Balls; 12:00 Noon Shotgun Start    Please send me the list players for each foursome, along with their handicaps and phone numbers by Friday this week?   Thanks.  Will provide more information for all players prior to tournament.  Foursomes  Beth Apollo (2):  EES and Global Services  Brent Price (1)  Kevin Sweeney (1)  Bob Hall (2):  Risk and Logistics  Chantelle:  Brent has given me names of players for his foursome - Brent, Scott Earnest; John Swinney and Frank Prejean.  Can you get handicaps and phone numbers (Enron) for me?  Thanks. 
 Please print a color copy for me.  Thanks.  Also, forward to Bob Hall - I can never be sure that attachments forward correctly.  Thanks.  --Sally 
   The following individuals from The University of Texas at Austin have agreed to join us honoring Enron/UT MBA Scholar Recipients Holland Brown, Christopher Cashman, and Soo Pang Tang:  Dean Bob May, McComb School of Business Dr. Linda Golden, Professor of Marketing Dr. Ehud Ronn, Director of Energy Finance Dr. Angela Dorsey, Assistant Director of Energy Finance Dr. Beverly Hadaway, Director of EDS Financial Trading & Technical Center  See you there!  Sally 713.417.1591 (cell #) 
 Probably should have sent this to you as well as Brent.  --Sally 
 Thanks for forwarding the note to me.  I have asked Shona and Brent to get back with me on answers to your questions.  Shona's team did move this weekend to ECS (as did I), and I am not sure how much additional chaos this has added to her life for today!  I will follow up with her mid -afternoon on details.  I agree with you that this serves as a good case study  - underscores indeed that we need to start some of the projects under Project Greenlight instead of continuing to document problems.  By definition,  to arrive at complete and accurate transfer daily of information from all source systems to RisktRAC, we must know the universe of all books and spreadsheets.  --Sally 
 Sorry to cut the conversation short last night, but frankly I was in tears and it didn't make sense to continue the conversation.  Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best for you.  We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you.   My reaction last night was simply shock, because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.  And your lead in to the conversation with "you know we are staying at a hotel...", was such a surprise.  Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving, but that was with Cindy, Richard, Brigeda, Chris and Cara staying in our home as well.  With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to the contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home.  What you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.  But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.  I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a frame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room.  Certainly other guests can enjoy these things, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit.  I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.  Sounds as if we should make that the "norm" from this point forward, and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone.  I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.  I am planning to take the day off from work, and the plan was that David would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions.  David has taken some office space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.  Then we can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), before having our nails done at 4:00.  But again, whatever works best for you.  Just let us know.  --Sally 
 What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Our meeting with EIM is set for Monday, October 12th from 9:00 to 10:30.  Ray Bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with Kevin Sweeney - Ray just initiated that meeting himself with Kevin one day last week, spur of the moment.  But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken place.  I have been working with Kent Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week to arrange our meeting now set for Monday.  I think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.  --Sally 
  The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations.  Just FYI.  I met with Kent Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to Brad, Jenny, and Beth today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has already reviewed Kevin Sweeney's budget for Operations.  Kevin reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and Kent says that Jeff and Ray are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.  --Sally 
  Angela:  Attached please find an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by Enron to honor this year's recipients of the Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  This is our third year to work jointly with many of you in the business school to award these scholarships to outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program. One of the highlights to those of us involved from Enron is the dinner that we host to recognize the students and to renew associations with many of you.  I hope that you will be able to join us at The Josephine House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.  In attendance from Enron will be Rick Causey and me, plus a few others from our senior management team who will be in Austin conducting our on-campus interviews for Enron's Analyst Program.  I will send a final list of attendees by the end of today.    Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works, LLC Phone - 713.853.5926 Fax - 713.345.8100 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Per my voice mail, Wanda is still the lead on this initiative.  From our conversation in your office, I had assumed that this would change.  Apparently has not to date.  Rick Buy and I are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour.  My intent had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and to suggest an approach for meeting his objectives.  He has added Wanda, Debbie Brackett, Bill Bradford and David Port to the tomorrow's meeting since our first point of discussion will be a joint project that Rick and I are sponsoring.  Unless he pairs down the group in tomorrow's meeting after our first topic, I doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversation in your office regarding operational risk.  --Sally 
 Is this the staff meeting for next Thursday, October 18th?  I will be here that day.  --Sally 
 What is it that Oxley is looking for in the ENW PRC report that you mentioned? 
 Through Friday, October 12 at 5:00 pm I will be in ECN 2748.  I will move to ECS over the weekend, so if you do not get my packet to me before 5:00 on Friday, please call my assistant (Christina Valdez x39106) to get my new location for Monday. 
 Attached is an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by Enron to honor this year's recipients of the Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  This is Enron's third year to award scholarships to three outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program. One of the highlights to those of us involved from Enron is the dinner that we host to recognize the students.  Dean May will be in attendance, as well as other faculty members from the business school, including Ehud Ronn, Director of UT's Center for Energy Finance and Research.  Since each of you will be in Austin to interview on campus on Tuesday, or will be arriving Tuesday to interview on Wednesday, I hope that you will be able to join us at The Josephine House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.  Please RSVP to me by Friday.  I will send you a complete list of attendees on Monday.  Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 Absolutely, we would enjoy having Angela Dorsey join us for dinner.  I am glad that you made the suggestion.  Please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar, and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well.  Thanks for the congratulations.  Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.  I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.  --Sally 
 I have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever.  I have coordinated with Bob Hall this morning and he will attend the 10:00 meeting in ECN 30C1.  He will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have.  All that I could do at this point is cough and nod!  I could certainly answer any questions for the Euros via e-mail, if needed, over the weekend.  Call me at home (281-370-8568) and I will be glad to do so.  I do expect to be in the office on Monday - hopefully with a voice.  --Sally 
 Can you keep a running list of attendees and RSVP's?  Thanks. 
 Can the travel agency send these things to you?  --Sally 
 I have an ENW budget review meeting with EGM (McConnell and Shankman) set for 1:30 to 2:30 on October 15th. My intent had been to join Rick's meeting at the halfway point at 2:30 under the original schedule.  With the time change of Rick's meeting to a 1:30 start, I will now miss his meeting.  Please let him know that I will be in the budget review meeting with EGM during that time period.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 That would be great if you have time.  If you run out of time, we can wing = it in lavendar.  Thanks.  --Sally=20

 I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.  ENW All-Logistics Meeting Friday, October 12 2:00 to 3:00 PM ECN 5 C-2   Sally W.

 McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.   Staff Meeting Attendees:  Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including Mark's directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.)  Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --Sally 
 I am glad that you will be able to join us.  Yes, we are planning on cocktails first and then dinner.  I am waiting for a response back from Dean May to confirm the time - tentatively set for 7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner.  We can probably either officially slip this schedule back by a half hour to 7:30 and 8:00, or unofficially stretch this to work with your schedule.  We would be happy to have your husband join us as well.  Let me know whether to expect one or both of you. --Sally 
 Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three scholarship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).  Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of "more senior" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.  Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bold above?  --Sally 
 We are looking forward to dinner with you and other faculty members on Tuesday, October 16 as we honor the three students who are the recipients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  We have booked The Josephine House once again.  I wanted to confirm several details with you.  1)  Cocktails at 7:00 pm; Dinner at 7:30 pm  --Do these times work for you?  2)  Last year's invitees from UT included the following: Associate Dean Philip Zerrillo				philip.zerrillo@bus.utexas.edu Assistant Dean Britt Freund				brittf@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Ehud Ronn					eronn@mail.utexas.edu Dr. George Gau					ggau@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Beverly Hadaway					hadawayb@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Linda Golden					mkllg@mail.utexas.edu Mr. Eloy Garcia					eloy.garcia@bus.utexas.edu  Would you like to make any changes or additions to this list for the dinner?  If so, please let me know the changes and appropriate e-mail addresses as necessary.  I will update you later in the week with the list of Enron attendees and the names of the students and their spouses, as applicable.  I look forward to seeing you again at the dinner.  I have enjoyed being involved in the interview process for selecting the scholarship recipients for the last three years, and I especially appreciate the opportunity for Enron and the University to jointly recognize these deserving students.  Please call me with any questions regarding the dinner.  Sally White Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of = the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one o= f our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mi= d and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured= into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that th= ere could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had s= ecured our first services customer and were to begin providing these servic= es on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during Nov= ember and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much int= erest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people)= , but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enr= on that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to "w= in again" as Enron. =20  Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the= formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts withi= n EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if= we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal s= tage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea wou= ld be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could pro= vide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  Wit= h the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron empl= oyees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this "in= dependent" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estat= e could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon = the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced co= sts for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of th= e CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other = services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that f= or the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true caree= r opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting= firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained. =20  Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There = is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We a= sked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, an= d I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this= .  Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our ho= pe would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around = that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted. =20  The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due dili= gence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consid= eration.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  I= t would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be = followed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit= to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Credit= or's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bid= ding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting fi= rm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process. =20  Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally 
 We would like to honor you as recepients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships at a dinner in Austin on Tuesday, October 16 at The Josephine House at 7:00 pm.  .  Dean May and other members of the staff and faculty of the McComb Business School will be in attendance, as well as several of us from Enron.  We would like to include your spouse, where applicable.  Please send me a return e-mail to let me know if you will be available on October 16.  As soon as I hear back from you, we will finalize details and e-mail an invitation to you with appropriate details.  Feel free to call me as well, if you have any questions.  My direct number at Enron is 713-853-5926 and my home number (best after 7:30 pm) is 281-370-8568.  --Sally 
 This is the memo crafted by Andrew Parsons that was sent to the traders las= t week regarding their back-up spots on the 30th floor of ECN during the re= mainder of the construction in ECS.  You and Greg were copied on the origin= al send of this memo.  --Sally=20 
 Thanks for owning the question and sending me your ideas.  I agree that some sort of planned rotation for experienced hires could be beneficial to the company and to the employees.  I have another week or so of living the 2002 budgets, and then I will be able to do other things!  I am saving your note, and will get in touch with you after that to talk about your ideas in more detail.  I am copying my assistant on this note so that she can schedule a time for us to get together.  --Sally 
 Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.  It was great to see Brent, Bob and Kevin upfront and center.  All of you must have done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend, because the ballroom was full!  A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.  So we have reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.  If a few others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.  Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with Melissa Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retaining Good People.  If you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week.  Golf on Monday, November 19?  Let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.  If you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you, this could be a nice reward.  Did I mention that David is in charge of this tournament?  I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.  Meagan and I will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  I hope that the streets will be ORANGE when I get there.  I will have my cell phone with me, if anything critical comes up.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday.  Have a great weekend!  --Sally 
 Best day is October 26.  Could make October 25 work.  October 24 and November 1 will not work for me.  --Sally Beck 
 Kevin, thanks for getting back to me with names so promptly.  Everyone on the list will be an asset on this effort.  --Sally 
 In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --Sally 
 SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation.  I am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for Project Greenlight.  I have rescheduled a meeting with Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30. I hope that you will be able to attend.  I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting.  I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Monday - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visit.  I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however.  Sally 
    A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.   Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.  Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.  Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.  Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.  Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.  Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.  Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  I.	During regular business hours  A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  -OR-  B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.   II.	After hours  For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed. 
 Thanks, Joannie.  Sorry I didn't see it the first time around!  --Sally 
 As discussed - happy reading on the plane...     Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Thanks, too, for getting my name in front of Ken!  --Sally 
 I participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Center for Houston's Future.  I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the Forum.  I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting, talented members of the Houston community.  I know that I will enjoy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well as collaborating on some "homework" assignments that we will complete between now and then.   I especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on Houston's future through developing both relationships and action steps  through my association with the Center.   Thanks again for making this opportunity available to me.  --Sally Beck 
 The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:  Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.  If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.  Greg Piper Sally Beck Mark Pickering

 When: Friday, October  5, 2001 1:30 PM-2:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    rescheduled from Oct. 1, 2001 to Oct. 5 2001 same time and location (different date) 
 I have had my head buried in budgets and am just now coming up for air!  Congratulations on your new role.  With your most recent experience in Investor Relations, I know that you will do a great job in communicating with Enron's Board.  Best of luck in your new role.  --Sally 
 Please check to see which reports will be reviewed in this meeting.  I have forwarded a few to you today to have printed in color.  If there are some reports to be reviewed that we don't have, can you get copies of those for me?  I want to take a look at them before the Oct. 10th meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Can I get a color copy printed?  Thanks.  --Sally 
  Can you get me a color copy of this document?  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  I am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear!  Let's hope for reveral of last year's score.  Hope that 2nd year is going well.  I will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with Dean May and the Enron scholarship winners later in October.  --Sally

 My hot buttons for operations  would be recruiting, career development and resource planning.  Before I simply make assignments, let me canvas my direct reports to be certain that we are assigning those with passion around these areas.  My staff meeting will be tomorrow at 9:00.  I will get back with you on volunteers and also to either reaffirm or alter the hot buttons that I mentioned.  --Sally 
 Thanks, Rosalee.  I have forwarded the information to Jenny Rub with our IT infrastructure group.  --Sally 
 Rick: =20  Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk. = We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involve= d in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objecti= ves.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.= Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's = businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or = is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20  I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list t= o have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complemen= ting, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's = internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being pilot= ed in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA aud= its, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the vario= us operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other = Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate = representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cove= r this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20  I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilit= ies at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quan= tifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impl= ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit= levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implement= ation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-deve= loped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business uni= t/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be form= ed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but m= ay not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiat= ives. =20  Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being add= ressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure t= hat information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate a= nd efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spa= nning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a = steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closel= y with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, res= ource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of = stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in = order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for fina= l input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for D= ebbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed pla= n and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight= when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate= to take this item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cr= oss-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new tea= m to focus on this bullet point. =20  Sally=20 
 UGHHHHH!! 
 Thanks for keeping me posted.  --Sally 
 FYI -Sally=20 
 John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunatel= y occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues= in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify = team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being ha= ndled during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to= your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know th= at everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we hav= e to stay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of y= our team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issu= es that could or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for= a similar role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination= deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify,= it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's p= erformance is impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the inf= rastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Un= ify.  Thanks.  --Sally=20 
 Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.  Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally 
 Thought I'd pass this comment along from Beverly!  --Sally 
 Thanks.  Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.  Lots of time on budgets - still continuing this week.  What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .  Thanks. --Sally 
 Wednesday is out for me, but Thursday, October 18 and Friday, October 19 both work.  I will tentatively hold both days until I hear back from you.  Thanks.  --Sally  Also, great job on organizing the CHF event.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the people I met and the discussion that we had have certainly created a lot of food for thought.  I am in the midst of budgets this week, but will check with you next week on getting our boys together. 
 Please put on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the note and your words of encouragement.  It is exciting to work on something that helps build a strong franchise for Enron.  I appreciate the opportunity of being a part of that.  --Sally 
 Always nice to see positive things.  Thought I'd share this with you.  --Sally 
 These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National Charity League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in Austin for interviews!  --Sally 
 If I were you, I would talk to Wanda and let her know that Ken is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved.  We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with Ken.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with Wanda, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to Dave, Janet and Dan stating that legal has named Wanda as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that Ken must be fully involved - and that you have asked Wanda to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy Wanda on the note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the updates.  When we had the problem with the server resynchronization, did someone from the Infrastructure team alert you ahead of time that they were going to do this during normal business hours, or did you have to be the detective to determine the cause once the problem was at hand.  Let me know. Thanks. --Sally 
 I may have zapped some of these updates from John since he has started this.  May be good in our budget review meeting on Monday with Louise to have all of these updates in hand - and any documentation that you all may have kept on performance issues prior to John starting this update process - as back up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on Unify in 2002 to improve performance and reliability.  Can one of you get all of these updates?  Thanks. --Sally 
 FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new Enron garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.  I have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?  I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Just to keep you up-to-date with the saga... 
 Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a= nd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I= would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside= red in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f= ees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s= hould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon= sor and ENW agree upon. =20  While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still= have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be= tween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E= OL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve= r John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho= c analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric= e accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader= requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th= e request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m= e and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel= ope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting = and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor= k every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu= re success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back= too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded= icated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.= It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage= d operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was= to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su= re that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very = motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe= d as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har= d to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it= is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut= or to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus= e they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, = nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi= ness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k= ind of wonder...=20  I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with= a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi= s role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir= cumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi= ce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe= r costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu= t going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20 
 Anthony:  It's after 5:00 today and apparently the break out by project for ENW IT Development Capital is still outstanding from Rob.  Although we have missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to Dan Leff and Wade Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow.  This is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get one of these packages finished.  Jenny:  Can Ken get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow.  We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, Beth Apollo,  and Anthony by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised packet by afternoon - to Thursday.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.  All of these would be IT applications support.  I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea= ch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this= week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop= le availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc= hedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw= o hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n= ot been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on = that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have= a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th= at Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu= gh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a = religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on = Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget= her.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche= strated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me= eting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com= mitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution = that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.= =20  Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES= budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t= he appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all= of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do= ne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That = is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide= d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest= ed split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec= ision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th= e chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t= ogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer= block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a= t 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t= hat works for both of us. =20  We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that = until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the= components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos= ts and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussio= n.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b= een reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d= iscussion on that.    --Sally=20 
 Thanks so much for your note.  I have assumed my new role as COO right at budget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under Enron Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.  The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!  Your association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.  CIndy is keeping me abreast of your project.  I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you.  While everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in New York.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  --Sally 
 Louise,  To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows:  Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees  Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop, Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA Operations, including Calgary)  Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering, Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)  Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)  3 - 4pm		EB3314		ENW: Operations & IT Dev.	Wes Colwell,Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Sally Beck, Beth Perlman, Mark Pickering, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper, Bob Hall (added-EA 												Operations)  I look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings.  --Sally 
 Yesterday, Wes and I discussed some changes to the timing of ENW budget meetings with Louise this week.  I also confirmed a swap in times on Friday afternoon with Vince Kaminski.  Outlined below are the revised topics and revised attendees.  The date, time and location of meetings on the calendars of  Wes, Faith and Louise remain unchanged - we have simply reorganized and reordered the ENW topics to be covered to facilitate the most beneifical grouping for understanding ENW's expenses.  Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees  Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop, Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA Operations, including Calgary)  Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering, Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)  Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)  3 - 4pm		EB3314		ENW: Operations & IT Dev.	Wes Colwell,Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Sally Beck, Beth Perlman, Mark Pickering, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper, Bob Hall (added-EA 												Operations)  I am sending Louise a separate e-mail message regarding the changes.  Wes and Faith:  Locations of the meetings for the above dates and time slots remain as they are on your original schedule.  If the number of attendees per the revised listing above warrants a room change, please let us know.  Otherwise, we will assume that the meetings noted above will take place in the locations noted above.  Call me with any questions.  	--Sally 
 Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest.  With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.  --Sally 
 Was Jim asking questions about the number of employees in ENW who would rem= ain with the Estate? =20 =20 Summary looks good - our meeting with Mike Deville on 2002 budgets is sched= uled for tomorrow.  --Sally 
 Kristin was there - I had to cut it short by a few minutes to meet with Delainey in the other building.,  Kristin stayed for a few more minutes to talk with Jeff and Stacey.  I can give you a more detailed download of all meetings tomorrowl  --Sally 
 Attached is a contact list for Operations, giving home and cell numbers for the Head of Operations for EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS and EEL.  Also listed are the lead risk and settlements personnel for each business unit.  My numbers are listed as well, so feel to call me this weekend if needed.  More detailed contact lists for gas risk, power risk and settlements have been sent to Geoff Storey, as requested by Louise and John.   The IT Help desk (x31411) will be running as usual 24 hours a day.   The Help Desk has appropriate contact numbers for DBA's for all operating systems.  If system problems are encountered, please call the Help Desk.  If potential system problems are not resolved promptly, you can also contact Jenny Rub, VP of IT Infrastructure at 713-851-5456 (cell phone),  281-463-4421(home phone) or  877-345-3812 (pager).

 Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally 
 Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally 
 Do we have this new one? 
 Please schedule a meeting for Thurday afternoon (30 minutes) with Mike DeVille, Kerry Roper, Greg Piper and me to review the operating budgets for 2002, and the impact on the ENW operating budget.  Thanks. 
 Sounds good.  I can be flexible - I will let Christina know to expect a call from your assistant on this.  --Sally 
 Causey concurs with postponing Doorstep reviews.  Haven't heard back from Buy, but I will find him in person this afternoon and will get back with you as soon as I do.  I agree - no need to prepare anything at this point while we are waiting for Buy's response.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Thought that my e-mail message to you last week asked for a moratorium on contacting London re: Doorstep Reviews until I circled back with you after conversations with Buy and Causey.  Sounds as if that moratorium either wasn't communicated or wasn't observed.  Causey left me a voice mail message on Sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all EEL reviews at present.  Still waiting on Buy.  I will find him today. 
 Just heard from Buy - he is in agreement with postponing Doorstep reviews for now.  He has asked me to create a tickler for this in January.  --Sally 
 Some interesting thoughts - many do hit home.  Thought that I would pass th= is along so that we can discuss it when we get together for lunch tomorrow.= --Sally=20 
 Yes, this was to be the review with Corp. - Lay, Whalley and Frevert.  I am= working with Mark LIndsey on the revised schedule - still don't have one, = but I will let you know as soon as I know something.  --Sally 
 Please print the attached on Enron letterhead and fax to Marilou ASAP at The Tremont House.  Thanks! 
 I will include Kerry in this meeting with Mike.  Do you want to attend as well?  Let  me know, and we will schedule it so that it works for you, too.  --Sally 
 Please print on letterhead and fax to Treemont house to Eugene Vaughan.  Thanks. 
 I know that your employees appreciate these meetings.  Thanks for staying so focused!  --Sally 
 Yes, I will be able to attend.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I will call you on this one...Sally 
 No 
 I am finally making it all the way through old e-mails.  I will try to call you and talk through all of this.  I am probably not as familiar as I should be on the procedures that exist.  --Sally 
 What are the plain facts around this Rexam deal?  --Sally 
 Here are contact numbers for Steve:  Work	512-427-3307  Cell	512-431-7739  I will see you tomorrow at 9:30.  --Sally 
 The November newsletter looked great!  This message was sent by Beverly Gibson for the December newsletter.  At Monday's board meeting, Lori Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  Lori also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that.  --Sally

 Big Pig:  Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?   UBS:  Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI. 
 Please join Greg Piper and me for an ENW Management Team meeting at 8:30 am in Conference Room # 4990 on the fourth floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, November 8.  Mark Pickering is travelling and may be able to join us by phone.  Please notify me only if you are unable to attend.  Thank you.  --Sally 
 Please print on legal paper and let's discuss.  Thanks. 
 Exciting news on the house, but I know that you must be busy!  When we moved to Champion Forest, we did the same thing.  Called the real estate agent to list our house on a Monday, got a contract on our house on Tuesday, and put a contract on our new house on Wednesday that week.  You and your husband must be into quick decision making as well!!  Yes, life at Enron is interesting these days.  Kind of like a soap opera.  Difficult for everyone to stay focused.  We are ready for some good news here.  With your move, let me know how I can help more with this December newsletter.  It is on my list for the weekend to recreate Lori Ewalt's article as a word attachment and get that to you.   I am glad that you have the permission slip in hand.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your help.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Spoke to Allen - this outage will not take place this weekend and is tentatively rescheduled for the weekend of November 17.  The feasibility of that timing will be re-evaluated at the end of next week.  --Sally 
  FYI - no move to the new building this week.  --Sally 
 Thanks so much for your note.  It is certainly nice to know that your thoughts are with me.  I, too, enjoyed visiting with you at our Woodlands session.  I was so sorry to miss the second forum, but I certainly feel that I made the right decision to be here.  When some of this is behind us at Enron, I do hope to get reconnected with the on-going efforts resulting from the CHF.  --Sally 
 Please print for me.  Highly confidential - cannot be discussed yet.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Mark received a payment in late November that stated that it would have to be repaid in full if he leaves Enron before the end of February 2002.  How do we handle this?  Has Mark mentioned this repayment?  --Sally 
 Contact numbers are listed below for Greg Piper and me if needed over the weekend.  Mark Pickering is out of the country, and we are coordinating with him as we complete scenarios on reduced costs.  Our team is continuing to work on this tonight and we will reconvene in the office starting at 8:00 am on Saturday.  We are working in Conference Room 4100 on the 4th floor of ECS (next to my office).  Please let us know when you would like to review the information.   --Sally   ENRON NET WORKS Office of the Chair  Name	Assistant #	Office #	Mobile #	Home #	Pager # Greg Piper  - CEO	Tina Spiller x3-5746	x3-6635	713-646-4734	713-668-9475	877-552-1564 Sally Beck -   COO	Christina Valdez x5-9106	x3-5926	713-417-1591	281-370-8568	N/A Pickering, Mark - CTO	Lisa Costello x3-1819	x3-7698	713-240-7406	713-973-9130	N/A

 Everyone worked hard and did a good job on Friday night and Saturday.  From IT, Jenny Rub, Steve Stock, Iain Greig, Anthony Dayao and Ramesh Rao were very engaged and did some great work.  Jeff Johnson was kept updated while in route back to Houston and he is in the office today reviewing the work that has been done to date.  Other ENW team members hard at work with us over the weekend have been Bob Hall, Beth Apollo, Kevin Sweeney, Kerry Roper and Marla Barnard.  Greg P. and I met with Kerry Roper this am to review the summarized version of the work that has been done.  Looks good - and it is unlikely that we will get with Greg Whalley to review the data this weekend.  He's meeting with commercial teams currently, and then will be on a plane for NYC later today.  We will take tomorrow to incorporate any changes that Jeff Johnson may have, and to get the entire weekend team to review and affirm (or change) the data as it is now summarized.  I will e-mail Greg W. an update on the work that we have done today and will copy you on that message.  Greg P. and I decided not to e-mail the details to him - better to review in person.  He will know that we are ready.  Quick preview of Monday's intended schedule:  8:00 am		All direct reports of OOC of ENW will meet in Conference Room 4175 in ECS to view together the web-cast of Dynegy conference call  9:00		Following webcast, Greg P., Marla Barnard and I will meet with OOC direct reports to review Q&A and to talk about next steps  9:30		I will meet briefly with weekend team to go over work needed on Monday re: cost saving measures  10:00		The start of a whirlwind series of floor meetings to reach all ENW employees (have the details mapped out - attached is copy of 			spreadsheet)  4:00		Regroup with weekend team to review data revised during the day on cost saving measures  5:00		Greg P. is buying...  Outstanding item on cost savings efforts:  We didn't include or touch the ISC.  Their budget for 2002 is included in Corp., but since responsibility now rests with you, we need to get Allan involved in the same exercise that we worked over the weekend.  Would you like for me to meet with him on Monday to get him started?  Then you can take it from there?  Or would you like to wait and address this with Allan when you are back in the office?  Just let me know.  Have a good flight back.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do for you tomorrow while you are in route back to Houston.  --Sally 
 Thanks - this will be a BIG effort, I know.  --Sally 
 From Dynegy's press release, here are details for Monday 8:00 am:  Conference Call Simulcast Dynegy and Enron will simulcast a merger conference call live via the Internet on Monday, November 12, 2001, at 8:00 a.m. CT, 9:00 a.m. ET.  The webcast can be accessed via dynegy.com (click on "Investor Relations"). The login number is 4365632 and the password is "Dynegy." 
 Please join Greg Piper and me in Conference Room 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS at 8:00 am on Monday, November 12.  To find this conference room, go through the security badge check point to your right as you arrive on the 4th floor, then make a left at the first hallway and the conference room will be on your right.  Dynegy and Enron will simulcast a merger conference call live via the Internet at 8:00 am Central Time.  We will access this webcast via the two large screens in the conference room.  We can watch this together as a group, and at the conclusion of the simulcast we will have a brief meeting to discuss Q&A regarding the merger and our action steps for the day as the management team of Enron Net Works.  I look forward to seeing you on Monday morning.  --Sally 
 Talked with Jenny - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.  I looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.  Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew. Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.  Have sent e-mail notice of meeting - included Tony Mends and Allan Sommer since I don't know Paskin's whereabouts and I do know that Mark Pickering won't be here.  Otherwise, Tony and Allan will be out of the loop.  Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?  I will also leave voice mail messages on everyone's Enron extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.  Brent is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.  Not sure that McConnell will meet with Greg W.   Brent will update me after the 3:00 meeting.  --Sally 
 We are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return from New York to review projected cost savings from ENW.  For each business unit that we support (EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS), we have prepared cost savings on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below.  Scenario 1:	Enron exits the line of business, with immediate headcount reductions and cost savings quantified; skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business; then final headcount reductions and cost savings quantified (Lights Out)  Scenario 2:	Enron retains and maintains line of business, but does not invest for growth; assumes no further systems enhancements; support is scaled back from current level and is minimal (Lights On - But Dim)  Scenario 3:	Enron retains line of business and invests modestly to accommodate known market changes; service levels are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal (Lights On - Brighter)  Cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following level of detail by commodity for EGM and EIM:  EGM:	Freight Markets					EIM:	Forest Products FX/IR/Equity						Steel Domestic Crude & Products International Crude & Products Domestic Coal International Coal  Cost savings have been identified for ENW's unallocated expense and capital as well.  We have worked with HR to adjust cost savings for anticipated severance costs.  --Sally  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com  Cell	713-417-1591 Home	281-370-8568 
 Up to you and Anthony.  We have already done a meeting in 3AC - today at 11:15.  We had not been provided info that Anthony had anyone in 3AC.  We had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans - I don't think that Anthony was able to attend.  Your options are to bring them over to ECN 14 at 1:30, or to have them attend a meeting at 1:00 in 2 Allen Center, 12 th floor in the Forum (a meeting room on that floor). I will be conducting that floor meeting at 1:00 for ENW employees in 2 Allen Center - it is Allan Sommers' ISC group.  --Sally 
  Can you update me today on status, issues and resolution?  We need to get back with Bill Bradford today.  --Sally 
 Great - I  will look forward to seeing you next week.  --Sally 
 Mike:  Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?  Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.  --Sally 
 This problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and RPS and RGS.  My understanding is that Todd Taylor on your team is working on this interface.  What is the expected completion of this interface, and if is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.  With the large number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem.  Can you call me today with an update?  Thanks. -Sally 
 James responded and filled me in on the issue.  Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems.  How are we going to clean up the existing backlog?  Did you know that this had grown so large?  James says that this sits in Shelly Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by Shelly.  Bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.  (Don't worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we can manage this better. 
 These counterparties are set up in GCP; however, they have not been set up in RPS and RGS.  Two things are needed.  First, we need an automated link from GCP to RPS and RGS.  Someone on Anthony Dayao's team is assigned to this, but the project has not been completed.  I have asked Anthony to update me today on how we can get this completed ASAP.  This will solve the problem on a go-forward basis.  The second need is a clean up effort on this backlog.  I have asked Beth Apollo for an update on her plan, and I will have her review this with you later today. --Sally 
 SInce your name was not on the original list, I am forwarding this to you.  Molly's comment that "many lack the clear understanding ..." in the third paragraph below - to whom does this apply and do you agree with her?  --Sally 
 Tom,  Thanks for the list of questions.  I am always glad when someone takes me up on that type of offer, because I genuinely want the input from others.  I have taken a quick glance at the list of questions and will take the time to read them thoroughly over a sandwich today.  After reading them, I will get back to you on an effective way to answer them, as I may not be able to personnally address all.  --Sally 
 As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.   We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.  The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning).  Mark Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon. He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have.  We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite".  There is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day.  The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend.  --Sally 
 In case you have your blackberry with you while in line with the masses, just learned from Brent Price (via Mike McConnell) that there is a daily meeting led by JIm Fallon with CEO's at 11:00 that reviews cash usage within the businesses and where a list, although not final, is being reviewed relative to lines of business and locations (i.e. Tokyo, Singapore, etc.) that may be exited.  It is key for ENW to anticipate these changes and seems that we could add something to the discussions from time to time.  Did you know about this meeting?  Seems like you should be there.  Can you nose in with Jim?  --Sally 
  Carol:  Would you enlarge the attachment so I can print for Sally.  Thanks,  Christina 
 Who was this who replied? 
 Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an Enron conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.  It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.  Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --Sally  Just thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the "ibuyit" and "ibuyit-payables" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures. 
 What are our communications with terminated employees and are there adminis= trative obstacles impacting them as the note below would indicate?    If th= ere is a backlog of info regarding employee status, I will be happy to key = punch to get caught up.   I am trainable and very willing!!!  --Sally=20 
 As discussed during yesterday's 5:00 pm meeting, the ENW direct reports to the Office of the Chair (VP level only) will meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss employee talent.  The meeting will be in Conference Room # 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS from 1:00 to 4:00 pm.  Please respond only if you are unable to attend.  Information to be discussed in this meeting should be submitted to Marla Barnard today.  Thanks for you time and attention to this.  --Sally 
 Yes, fully prepared.  Thanks.  --Sally  Have a great time on vacation.  Relax and enjoy the family.  Say hello to Jo for me. 
 Employees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly.  We want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing Enron's business.  HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.  The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.  That process is slated for February, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that.  I am happy to answer your questions.  Feel free to send me others as the come up.  --Sally 
  Attached is list of questions.  How soon could we have answers to these?  I would appreciate any help that you could give me on this.  --Sally 
 I will be in the office on Tuesday next week (November 21), but hope to take the day off on Wednesday.  The kids will be out of school on Wednesday and we are going to Austin to be with my family for Thanksgiving.  So we hope to be on the road on Wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic.  With that, sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on Monday, November 26.  If you want to try and talk before then, a good time to get me is in car during my morning commute.  Number is 713-417-1591, and some range between 7:00 am and 8:30 am might work.  These are certainly trying times.  You have been in my thoughts, and you have my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight, out of mind.  --Sally 
 Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.  How are your 5:00 pm meetings?  I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally   Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!! 
 It's 11:55 am on Sunday - have tried your cell phone, but did not get an answer.  Left you a message that Beth, Jeff, and Brent are all here and working on their respective pieces.  We will convene as a group about 12:30 here in my office.  If you can join us at 1:00, we can give you an update.  --Sally 
 Great work again from your team!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:  Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)  Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings  5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings   65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction    This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.  --Sally 
  Are we having some fun now?  Thought about you today - in fact, ran across a business card of yours that I had in a file from Phibro Energy.  I know that I have missed your insight and opinions into Enron's roller-coaster.  Is this ride better with eyes open or closed?  --Sally 
 Sorry - I read the first e-mail before seeing this one.  Thanks for not asking me where my head was when we talked!! --Sally 
 Tough times - and lots of work.  I know that you must be swamped, and that you had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget process.  I am sure it is even tougher now!  Got a call from Melissa Becker today regarding retention.  On Rick's behalf, she was asking about London operations.  I assume that you have covered that.  Her specific question related to Mike.  I told her that you and I hadn't talked, and that my assumption was that you had this one covered.  Accurate?   Take care.  -Sally 
 Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.  --Sally 
 FYI... 
 Yes. 
 FYI - response after my call to Brian.  Agreement refers to employees of Enron Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas specifically.  Enron Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from Enron Networks.  Close date on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from that point.  --Sally 
 Thanks - Anne did call me this morning with the details.  --Sally 
 I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a lifetime or two ago!!  Sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with Teddy was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at Enron.  Thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night.  My little guys aren't so little any more.  Meagan is a senior this year - had all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done.  She has gotten one acceptance - University of Oklahoma.  She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to hear from them.  She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probably after the first of the year.  (By the way, David and I are strongly talking up the state school thing, given the current Enron share price, or diminished portion thereof.)  This senior year is going by all too quickly, especially since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the Enron Building.  And mentioning the building, I moved to Enron Center South (the new building) in mid September.  I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.  Kinneman is on this floor, too.  Kind of a cool building, but weird because it is not really finished.  Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some elevators are "panelled" with rough plywood inside.   The sky ring thing is cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space.  We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down.  Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, but we are here!  Do let me know if you are going to be in Houston anytime soon.  I would love to get together with you.  Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints,  my previously planned November London visit is not happening!  Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London.  --Sally 
 Have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.  THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED:   Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.  Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for Beth's EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.  You will want to gut check this with Beth.  Had Jenny's current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.  Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.  Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.  You will need to get that detail from Jenny to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.  There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.  Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).  His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.  But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.  Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.  Please go over details with Tom and make corrections as needed.  Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.  Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.   Allan only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.  So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.  Please review with Allan and make corrections as needed.   Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families.  You can reach my by cell phone tommorrow (mine: 713-417-1591 or David's:  713-299-1436) or at my parents' home starting about mid-afternoon (512-458-5510).  We will drive back from Austin sometime on Friday.  Could come in on Saturday or Sunday, as needed.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  Did you get the job?  I certainly hope so.  I appreciate your thoughts and prayers - both are very much needed!  We are all still somewhat in a state of shock over the state of the company.  I find myself working lots of hours on things that several months ago we wouldn't have thought about.  Life is always interesting - it may take a while to see where this twist is leading us, but I do know that it will be interesting!  --Sally 
 Thanks for the note.  I wish you well as you continue to build your business outside Enron.  Unfortunate circumstances here have caused us to make some tough business decisions that impact contractors such as yourself.  I appreciate your hard work over the last several years and the contributions that you made in helping to manage various businesses within Enron.  I am saving your e-mail address and phone number.  There may be an occasion for us to work together again.  Best wishes for you and your family.  -Sally 
 FYI... 
 Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from "above" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.  If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally 
 Let's get together tomorrow.  My calendar is pretty open.  Understand your request, and you have my assurance that I will be very up-front with you.  No breaking news to share with you, however.  Would love to get your input on the organization going forward, if you have time tomorrow.  Yes, kind of of bleak.  --Sally 
 Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from Enron Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until today.  I tried to open the attachment - our network operations require that the file be saved first before opening.  Did that, and what comes up looks like it is in tongues!!!  Unfortunately, I can't read anything, but hopefully Nancy was able to review it.  I realized today that the article that Lori Ewalt gave me in hard copy at the board meeting is still in my NCL folder.  I meant to retype and get this to you in a word attachment, but frankly the hours at Enron have been horrific.  I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM last Tuesday.  Unless Lori got that article to you in another way, we are missing that from the newsletter!  I will call you and if indeed Lori's article is not in there (not the permission form, but another article), I will contact Sally and I will simply make copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing.  Sorry about this!!  Sounds as if you had a busy Thanksgiving on top of a move as well.  Hope that you are enjoying the new place.  Too bad about the Sooners on Saturday.  David had thought about driving to Dallas next weekend for the Big 12 Championship game, but obviously won't be doing that now!  --Sally 
 Louise:  Who in HR is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list?  We can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid, but knowing the source of the list you refer to from HR and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem.  --Sally 
 Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are "baked enough" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.  Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Do you have a few minutes to get with me this week?  You seem to be the "in charge" person for the Estate.  I wanted to visit with you about the needs that you see for the Estate and the role that I might play.  I am focused currently on aiding in the due diligence work around the formation of Netco (from an operations perspective), although I am not on the list to go with Netco.  I am also working with Jim Fallon on supporting the business plans for the remaining wholesale  businesses within Enron.  Greg PIper and I also still share the OOC responsibilities for Enron Net Works as well.  I am committed to Enron, but would appreciate a frank discussion about the timeline you see for me at Enron.  I need to have a job, and want to be appropriately prepared if the timeframe for me at Enron is limited.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 There are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the Netco list.  Two of the three are Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to Louise.  Another excellent player is Shona Wilson.  She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC before joining Enron, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.  I am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netco.  If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for Netco.  --Sally 
 The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.  Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.  Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally 
 Today was parent/teacher conference day at Tyler's preschool and I had signed up for the 9:00 am slot.  Sorry that I couldn't make the meeting.  I had asked Bob Hall to attend in my place - I know that he also had an 8:30 am meeting related to retention, so I don't know whether or not he made it to your meeting.  What is your calendar like for drinks next week?  --Sally 
 Pretty cute - makes me want to open a roll of cookie dough when I get home today!!  Happy New Year! --Sally 
 More info related to first e-mail... 
 Does any of this make sense to the two of you?  Please get back with me pon January 3rd and let me know if we do have outstanding issues with AEP and if we have unfinished projects from Carolyn Guilley.  Thanks. --Sally 
    Mari:  Here's the contact list Sally asked I forward to you.    Christina Valdez Asst. to Sally Beck 713.853.9106 
   I am out of the office on vacation Thursday, December 20th - Friday, December 21st.  I will be in town and can be reached by cell phone over the next few days (713-417-1591).  On Wednesday, December 26 - Friday, December 28 ( following Christmas), I will be in New York.  My contact number/hotel while in New York is listed on the attached in the event something critical should arise.  I am attaching for your convenience a "Holiday Key Contact" list for operations for the business units.  Have a safe and wonderful holiday!      --Sally 
 Yes, I think that it makes sense to keep the system available over the weekend for the foreseeable future.  I had operations teams accessing critical data, available only in SAP, on Friday evening and Sunday this past weekend.  It is very likely that our need to do so will continue, unlimited to weekdays.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Our curve validation process is one of the key items that Arthur Andersen will be reviewing at year end.  AA has looked for us to strengthen this process, and Tom Bauer stated about 6 weeks ago that he would be looking closely at this.  (His focus may now have been diverted, but I would also anticipate that AA's reviews will have a new intensity about them!)  In preparation for this, I have called a meeting today with the risk leads across all commodities.  I want to hear from them in a protected environment today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation.  We will review the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation (from the task force lead by Shona Wilson) and discuss specific action steps to insure that we demonstrate an improved curve validation process.  I have a meeting with Shawn Kilcrest and Tom Bauer later this week and, following today's meeting, I hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made.  You are welcome to join us in this meeting.  If you do not attend, please get with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aware of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improvements that may need to be made quickly.  The meeting will be held as follows:  	3:00 - 3:30 PM ECS  4102 (my office)  Attendees:	Jeff Gossett Stacey White Sam Leuschen Scott Mills John Swinney Frank Prejean Michelle Bruce EBS TBD 
 Is Kathy the right contact?  Or should it be Brian?  Let's talk about changing the Canadian reporting relationships - especially risk.  I think that I will propose that to Lavorato today.  But let's talk first.  --Sally 
 Any ideas on why Canadian numbers wouldn't have made it into V@R calc today?  --Sally 
 Bradford called last night - some problem with SO2 marks.  Bill thought that our curves were way off.  Sounds as if that is not the problem but instead that the book in which these deals were put had previously housed only intercompany deals and not third party deals.  Book wasn't picked up in Credit's exposure, making it look as if we were off on our mark versus Barclay's mark by $20MM.  I have gotten one story from Brent.  What do you know about this?  --Sally 
 Elizabeth/Jim:  This is a "Draft" of process that I mentioned in our meeting in Jim's office on Monday.    -----Sally 
 Attached is the memo that Christina delivered to you/Jim on  Tuesday.  One update is that Scott Mills is now out of the office through Christmas.  Kristin Albrecht would be the appropriate risk rep in Scott's place is a meeting were to be held this week.  --Sally 
 Sorry that we didn't get together today.  I plan to be out of the office from now until  Monday, December 31.  I will be in Houston through Christmas, and can be available by cell phone on Thursday and Friday this week, December 20 and 21.  I will be in New York for several days following Christmas, from December 26 through December 28.  Tomorrow, I will send you a contact list for Mid and Back Office Operations for the remainder of this week and the week of Christmas.  That contact list contains my hotel number in New York, if something critical were to arise while I am out of the office.  I had provided you yesterday with a list of IT and Operations personnel to be included in the meeting to be set with Elizabeth Saeger regarding the process for handling terminations of transactions and arriving at the residual value of deals non-terminated deals in the risk books.  I have not seen a meeting scheduled yet, and as you can see from the memo that I sent you yesterday, many risk book administrators will begin their vacations around Christmas this week.  If you still plan to hold the meeting this week, please notify my assistant, Christina Valdez (x39106) and I will try to join in by phone.  I hope that you and your family have a great Christmas.  I will see you back in the office on December 31. Feel free to call me in the interim either at home or on my cell phone.  --Sally 
 Your champagne is under my desk.  I hope that you and Craig will enjoy it!!   Have a wonderful holiday and I will see you on the 31st. 
 Don't know what works best with your schedule.  Ernie Pitterelli (head of Operatins for UBS Americas) will be here on Monday and Tuesday and one of the things that we will discuss is the risk roles - position rerporting and calculation of P&L.  Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations, so it could be helpful for you to be here.  What was Wes' response?  --Sally 
  FYI... 
 Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.  Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your call a few weeks back.  Has been totally crazy here, with incredibly long hours over the last 6 to 8 weeks.  Today is my last day in the office until Monday, December 31.   I need the break!  Has been hard to squeeze in time to get ready for Christmas.  And we are hosting Tyler's 4th birthday party on Friday this week.  Christmas at home, as usual, and the Meagan and I will be off to New York the morning of December 26th with her friend Nicole and her mom.  We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors!  Shopping, eating and seeing plays - will be back on the night of the 28th.  Our upcoming trips are to Orlando for four days in early March with the high school drill team for nationals competition. Then spring break in mid-March in Telluride for our first family ski trip!  Hopefully we will all come back in one piece!  Have a wonderful Christmas and enjoy the sun in San Diego.  Christmas cards are coming - you may just receive yours after Christmas.  Mo is in town and will join us for dinner tomorrow night. Grapevine has it that she is skinny as a rail!  College update:  Meagan got her applications in to UT, OU, SMU and TCU before November 1.  She has acceptance letters from OU and SMU in hand, and is waiting to hear from UT and TCU.  I have no idea what her decision will be!  Our best to Paul and the girls.  --Sally 
 James will be a real sport to fly with us and then turn around!!  Maybe he would like to do some Christmas shopping!!  That is a great fare - thanks for including us as buddies!..  My hair cut appointment is on Saturday morning, the 29th, so the timing on our return on Friday the 28th is very flexible for me.  Whatever flight you think would be best for us to return on will be fine.  I am getting the phone number for the hotel and will forward that to you.  I will also get Meagan to coordinate with Nicole on their choices on Broadway plays and then I will get tickets for us.  --Sally 
 We need your help in completing the following today, per Sally Beck's voice mail message:  Review your tab in this e-mail to verify the list of retained employees (your name should be in the list as well).  Where applicable, if you have employees designated to go to NewCo, please indicate that on your list (we are striving for a list of employees who will remain with the estate).  Return a hard copy of your list to Marla Barnard by 2:00 PM today, with your signature that the list is accurate and complete, or with appropriate changes/updates noted.  Complete a summary template being sent to you by either Kerry Roper or Mike Galvan that will give us your total number of employees (with subtotals for those going to NewCo and those remaining with the Estate) and your total number of employees.  Please complete this by 2:00 PM also.  Thanks. 
 I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.  I don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to attend.  I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their schedules.  I will let you know later who will attend.  I will be out of the office that day.  --sally 
 Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back office services.  Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.  The purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.  I have been capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.  Today I decided to recap in writing for everyone.  Thought that you might be interested.  Open the attachment to the e-mail below.  This way you will know more of the details of our efforts each week.  --Sally 
 The attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning.  Highlights from last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well.  Let me know if anything has been left off the list.  --Sally 
 I will have that to you by the end of the afternoon.  I have set aside my afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get with Bob Hall to do an update for Brian Redmond on the HPL sale before his Tueday meeting with Louise.  I will share these items with you as I get them checked off my list this afternoon.  --Sally 
 I will be out of town on Thursday.  I think that it would be great if you could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.  If you can make it, please try to attend.  And I would love to have a voice mail message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.  Thanks. 
 The best list of operations employees involved in UBS Warburg Energy is the= executed offer letters and employment agreements that have been turned in.= I also have an up-to-date org chart.  Can we reconcile your distribution = list with this org chart?  I would like to get his right.  --Sally 
 I have put this meeting on my calendar.  You don't need to forward to anyone else.  Chantelle should handle that for Brent's EGM team.  Thanks. 
 Latest update - FYI 
 As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates:  Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's arrival, etc.  I will also have details of resource needs.  We can use this to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of these initiatives.  I will welcome your comments on the timeline.  --Sally 
 Thought you'd like to know.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the birth of Emma.  I hope that everyone is doing well.  Enjoy your time off and the opportunity to hold and hug that new baby.  I will look forward to seeing pictures the next time that we get together.  --Sally 
 I have my list at home, but I know that we need Dad's sister Jane and her husband, Homer and Karen, Sarah in Austin (whose kids are independently dell-wealthy) and I can't remember who else.  I know that there were ten invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.  The list below plus those in this paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.  I will try to catch David and have him look at the list that I copied from Mom.  Thanks for these.  I will do invitations this weekend.  Do you have the address for Josephine's House?  And do we have a time?  --Sally 
 Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.    All of these of course with top priority!  I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.  She has already made  a very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations side.  How is life treating you?  I know that their is a lot going on in the London office, as well.  How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office been?  Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?  Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding their baby.  Hope that all is well with you.  --Sally 
 I will need a rental car in Oklahoma - looks like National is the one to use.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Your info is right - although I do hope that all is not dark.  Wouldn't have imagined this outcome two weeks ago.  But when Bob Hall removed his name from the Netco list, timing was critical in working with potential purchasers in the auction process.  There wasn't anyone else to step in, so I did so just to help coordinate the due diligence effort and the transition.  I spent many hours with the UBS operations team last week, and they are the ones who decided that they wanted me to take the role.  It was the time that I spent with the UBS team that changed my mind about considering the role.  My reporting relationship will be to the head of American operations in Stamford, CT.  I am quite impressed with him.  The further negative news here was a factor as well.  Should be interesting.  --Sally 
 Thought you might be interested in these two changes.  Mary has actually be= en out of the office since late February.  All of her global database respo= nsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his team, u= nder Beth Apollo.  Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been lessened= over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied on my = business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for their ev= aluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules.  --Sally= =20 
 Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day.  Thanks. --Sally 
 I assume that Kathryn has communicated this to you.  I have only read Kim's e-mail - I will talk with her later today.  --Sally 
 I will meet with Kim this afternoon on her comments on ConfirmLogic.  Bottom line, no sign off from Kim at this point.  Thought you might want to know.  --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with= regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has con= tributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the developmen= t of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective = systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's pers= onal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary we= ll. =20  Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works = of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Z= ipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its e= arly stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a= smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges n= ecessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team = has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  ope= rations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri'= s team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team wi= ll continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, De= alBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her t= eam and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I me= t with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment. = Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the p= ast 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work c= losely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce bus= inesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look for= ward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.  =20 
 Here is final presentation.  I worked with Fred and Stephen this morning to make final changes.  --Sally 
 Thanks for following up on this.  We will incorporate you numbers for offices and spots in the Tower. 
 I am taking Good Friday as my discretionary holiday for the year.  I will be in Austin with my daughter for her official tour and info session at UT, plus a look at dorms.  Patti will have numbers where I can be reached in Austin.  We are making final changes to the orig presentation today - I will be reviewing those tomorrow in Austin.  I am e:mailing you a current draft version, although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed.  I am still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size.  I have taken the work that Rahil and Fred have done on the services and have made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a presentation. 
 Memo on floor meetings, plus my reply to Greg and Philippe. 
 Please print for me - Black & white okay - I can't seemt to get this printed from my printer.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for rounding up the tickets for the Orange Bowl.  You can mail them to me, or just hold them until I see you after Christmas.  Mike's wife decided not to make the trip, so he won't be using the tickets.  Jody Crook will use the other two tickets.  Lunch during the week between Christmas and New Years sounds great to me.  I will be working that week, but would be glad to meet you guys at Champions for lunch if that is best.  Or if you are game for Irma's, just let me know when you would like to come downtown.  --Sally 
 Did Debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo?  Is she raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?  Just curious, before I send any type of response.  I would need details from you around the process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.  Surely one feeds the other?  --Sally 
 Great - we will look forward to seeing you on the 13th and 14th.  I will work on an agenda this week, and will send you something later in the week. --Sally

 Your note has made my day.  Thanks for taking the time to send it.  Your thoughts and support mean a lot to me.  How lucky I am to have you for a sister and friend!  --Sally 
 Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for your schedule).  I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend. However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether or not you included that on your list.  Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned by Irma's son, Luis).  I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as well.  I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see at the end of January.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the responses -- all look great.  I like coming over knowing that my calendar will be pretty full.  Dinner sounds great, too.  I am having dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment. I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.  Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was smooth.  --Sally 
 I am glad that you asked!  I will be happy to bring your things back for you.  Niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while I am there next week and she is coordinating my schedule, so we see one another quite a bit.  It will be easy to do this.  --Sally 
 Let's plan on Monday night for dinner.  Someone included me on the distribution list for your going away bash, so I have put that on my calendar for Wednesday night as well.  --Sally 
 Thanks!  I understand that congratulations are in order for you, too.  We should definitely do dinner and celebrate.  I think that Niki has arranged that for Thursday night.  I will look forward to it.  --Sally 
 Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:  review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same day,  to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe)  discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to continually improve the process),  discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR  do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE  discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London  discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of  mid and back office services   In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan to meet with Fernley as well.  Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday. 
 Please see following details for Friday's brainstorming session:  Date: Friday, January 12, 2001 Time: 8:30 - 2:00 PM (Continental breakfast & lunch will be served) Place: Four Seasons Hotel 1300 Lamar St. "Highland" Room (to the right, upstairs to 2nd floor, then left) Parking: Stamp will be provided in meeting room to validate parking tickets  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas cards.  I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the major goals for the trip are:  to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same  day,  to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),  to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year,  to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR  I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like for me to meet.  Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy. Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this week.  I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally 
 I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the time to vote.  Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow.   For those employees who typically work later hours, please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office. Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count.  It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening. Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome. 
 This one is pretty funny... 
 The other place in San Antonio is Westin's La Canterra.  I will contact both and get info.  Then we should make reservations soon.  I'll call Cindy tonight and fill her in.  -Sally 
 I plan to work out of the London office during the week of January 15.  I will leave Houston on Sunday and will be in the London office starting around noon on Monday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Monday, January 22. The primary goals of the trip are:  to work with Mike Jordan on an action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same  day,  to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 per my e:mail to you for managers and above within Operations),  to hold a training session for business controllers in the London office who will participate in Doorstep   reviews this year (outside EEL),  to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR  Patti Thompson (x39106) will have a detailed itinerary in hand if you need to reach me at any time next week. 
 I love it!!  I think that is perfect.  Much easier for my family and probably for everyone else.  That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, assuming that works for everyone.  Removing some of the travel hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time, too.  Hyatt Hill Country is one obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.  There is a newer resort in the area also.  I can't think of the name of it offhand, but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you. --Sally 
 Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another spot besides 47 Park?  I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally 
 I will attend the meeting on Thursday, but will have to leave around 1:15 to make it to a meeting at the Doubletree where I am speaking at 1:30.  Thanks. 
 Jeff, thanks for taking care of this for Fred. --Sally 
 Please see following details for Thursday's operational risk meeting:  Date: Thursday, January 11, 2001 Time: 1:00 - 4:00 PM Place: Hyatt Regency Hotel "Regency" Room (up escalators to 2nd floor, next to gift shop) Subject: Operational Risk Attendees: All Energy Operations Managers and above (ENA, EIM, EGM)  Please note: If you are unable to attend for any reason, please contact Sally at ext. 35926.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please make every effort to attend this meeting as it relates to the work you will be doing with bonuses this week.  Date:  Today - Tuesday, January 9, 2001 Time: 1:30 - 2:30 PM Place: EB 30C1 Subject: Results from Market Compensation Study by Todd Burke Attendees: Sally & Brent's Direct Reports (Operations only) + HR  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I knew that you would still be in London.  Just thought that I would start to copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's going on.  Yes, I will be in London next week.  Plan to fly over on Sunday night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.  I will be there through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.  Let's definitely plan to get together.  I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my schedule for next week.  I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when we can get together.  Looking forward to it.  --Sally 
 Thanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule.  Hopefully, this will be fruitful for everyone.   And maybe unnecessary at some point in time!  Thanks.  -Sally 
 Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  Meagan called this afternoon to tell me the news.  I will perhaps get more details when I get home tonight.  I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.  Let us know what we can do to help.  I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.  We will be anxious to meet our newest neighbor.  --Sally 
 I will be out of town on January 19, so Brenda Herod has agreed to make the presentation for Rick Causey.  Please replace my name with hers for all communication regarding this Analyst Orientation.  Thanks. 
 Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the location for the meeting will be sent to you early this week.  I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that will keep you from attending the meeting. 
 Great - I will add her name to the distribution list so that she will get our upcoming note on the location for this meeting.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.  So it is gone - but not sent!!  Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology. 
 I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.  I have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him. The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school. I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to Austin early.  Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early.  I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased. (Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you.  Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that. Let me know.  --Sally 
 Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.  Congratulations on the baby!  I hope that you are feeling well.  I am so happy for you and your husband.  My how your lives will change!!  But how enriched they will be. Our three are so much fun.  I will also always be honest with expectant moms and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.   If you ever want some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me know.  I would be glad to share my experience with you.  --Sally 
 Sounds good to me. 
 I will ask Patti to set up a meeting for us this week.  Your name has been on my list to call - a trip to the Orange Bowl last week cut my week short, so I will look forward to getting with you this week.  --Sally 
 I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.  It is always great to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front of you.  No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after graduation.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about your offer while you are going through that process.  Enron had a fantastic year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  We hope that you will be a part of that.  My number at work is 713-853-5926.  Please feel free to call me any time.  If it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, my home number is 281-370-8568.  Don't hesitate to call.  Sally Beck sally.beck@enron.com 
 I told  Tom last week that I have a standing systems meeting on Thursdays at 9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.  Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday this week?  Thanks. --Sally 
 I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!  My husband (an OU grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and see the team absolutely stop FSU.  If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are on vacation, please give me a call.  2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  I hope that you will join us and be a part of that.  My office number is 713-853-5926.  If it is more convenient for you, feel free to call me at home as well.  That number is 281-370-8568.  Boomer Sooners!!!  Sally Beck sally.beck@enron.com

 I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  I did not know that he had passed away.  I know that he has been very ill.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  I know that it must hard to say goodbye to someone that has been such a part of your life for so long.  We will miss you on the 11th, but certainly understand your absence.  --Sally 
 Absolutely - Clara should have been included.  I asked for a list of managers and above within EGM from Chantelle, and used that for the distribution list.  Her list omitted Clara.  All lists that I requested from EGM, ENA and EIM were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of our year-end PRC process.  I don't think that I got consistent info from everyone, so I am rechecking names right now and will send Clara a message about the meeting as I also clean up any others that were left off of lists. Thanks for catching this.  --Sally 
 I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.  The purpose of this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.  I know that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or are currently providing services to outside parties.  While there are efforts underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office services.  I hope that you will be able to attend.  Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you on Monday when Patti returns from vacation. 
 I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.  I bought a book at Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc. These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well.  I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if there is any place that we could get excited about going. 
 I have a standing staff meeting that I attend on Monday mornings, so I will not be available when you and James meet on the 8th.  I will look forward to getting with James after your meeting for an update. 
 I have attended three ASE's and would be happy to visit with you about my opinions.  I will ask Patti to schedule a meeting.  --Sally 
 I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up. Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete. Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very useful.  I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and I will follow through on that if you would like.  Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good one for you.  --Sally 
 I will be there at 8:40 on Monday -- not a word until then... 
 I have been out of the office at the Orange Bowl game and have just returned within the last hour.  That probably would make next week better for me than this week.  Give me a call and we will set something up.  My number is x35926.  If you don't reach me, call my temp assistant (Camella - x39106) and she will be able to set  up a meeting.  Thanks. 
 I will be out of the office on Wednesday, January 3.  I am married to an OU graduate, so we are headed to the Orange Bowl to hopefully see Oklahoma hang onto their number 1 ranking.  I will be back in the office after lunch on Thursday, January 4.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has phone numbers where I can be reached.  Please contact Bob Hall at x36956 with any questions while I am out. 
 We will also have both of our cell phones with us:  David  713-299-1436 Sally    713-417-1591  We will hope for a little warmer weather in Fort Lauderdale!!  The game is on Wednesday evening - we will do some sightseeing during the day on Wednesday. I will be back in the office on Thursday afternoon.  Love, Sally 
 Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another delivered.  Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze. --Sally 
 I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP. Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally 
 I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed working as long as I could.  Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while afterwards!! 
 I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up.  I sent the note below to Kim.  I am sure that she manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization.   It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed.  That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task.  Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one that gets the phone calls.  The ENA organization must develop confidence in others on our team.  Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs.   Thanks. 
 Lexi:  In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with this disposition:  Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the career center?) and no to Ryan.  I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with    Enron North America Corp. 
 Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner? As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get his caught up.  Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle for the RMT Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to Stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date? --Sally   Kim S Theriot                12/27/2000 05:51 PM 
 Thanks for letting me know.  I am sure that you have communicated with the Portland risk group regarding this slip up.  What assurances have you gotten from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books?  Do you think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is? --Sally 
 I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews for the first quarter.  As long as the New York review isn't the week of January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip. Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me  - I know that you are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical things that you need to handle.  I will try to send you a list of topics that I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting point.  You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while I am there.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Stephanie,  Sally would like to renew this subscription.  I'm sorry I did not respond earlier.  Her co. # is 0413 & CC # 105588. Please let me know if you require additional information.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106    Enron North America Corp. 
 Can you put a referenced as of date on the spreadsheet itself?  If you print the spreadsheet for reference after receiving the e:mail, there is no as of date that appears on the print out of the spreadsheet.  Your attachment includes the date as the name of the file, but this does not appear when you simply print our the attached spreadsheet.  Thanks.  --Sally Beck 
 The items noted look like a good start to earlier detection of issues that may require reruns of valuation.  Thanks for marshalling the right resources to make this happen.  I will look forward to seeing your process timelines for current, iterim and target final state.  If my trip to London in mid-January works for your schedule, maybe this is something that we could go over then.  --Sally 
 To continue to keep you in the loop - looks like Mike is moving in the right direction on this --Sally 
 Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus information.)  I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally 
 You should see this reply from Mike -- it is more positive than the response from James New.  Sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes, systems, commercial practices, etc. to move to a same day calculation of their books.  Mike and I have talked about this as a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.  I expect to review that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion. That is why you haven't yet seen the document.  --Sally 
 I should have included you on this contact list.  I will remember to do so next time.  I will be in the office all of this week, so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week. 
 I did not see an attachment to this memo from MP.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Good memo on contacts.  Thanks for copying me.  Have a wonderful vacation. I know that you will be glad to have Jordan back with you.  --Sally 
 Unfortunately, I will miss your farewell at Slick Willie's on January 3rd.  I am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to London.  I will be in Miami on January 3rd, hopefully celebrating an Oklahoma win in the Orange Bowl earlier that day.  David found us tickets to the game.  Not great seats, but they are in the stadium.  Hey, it's not UT, but it should still be fun to go.  I will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in Houston.  But I know that I can count on you to be just as vocal from London!  I plan to be there at least quarterly in 2001, and will definitely welcome your first hand observations on operational areas that may need attention.  Hopefully between e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch.  Tell Ann that I hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the whole family.  I think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives to give them this experience.    Have fun -- and set them straight!! 
 Thanks for including me in the invitation to Slick Willie's.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend.  I will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami and will not return until the morning of the 4th. 
 We are making some progress with the timeliness of London information.  More to come... 
 Laurel,  Sally's plans are to be in the office Jan 2 & 5 only.  She will be out of town Jan 3 & 4.  Patti x39106 
 Tammie,  Sally is on vacation this week, therefore she will not be attending staff meeting.  She will be back in the office 12/27.  Patti x39106 
 The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.  Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your best estimate of trading results.  Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information for the worldwide trading organization.  I hope that all of you enjoy your holidays.

 Please print this for me in color ASAP.  I need to review it today and get back to Louise.  Thanks. 
 Got your most recent message.  Your observation is correct that the Enron Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to date to expose her to Doorstep.  After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project. 
 I understand from Shona that you and she have discussed our plans for Doorstep Reviews in 2001.  I am asking via this note for my assistant to set up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline, methodology, Andersen's involvement and the involvement of your team.  I will be on vacation the week of December 18.  I will be working the week between Christmas and New Year's, so if you are in the office we can plan on getting together that week. 
 I will be out of the office on vacation during the week of December 18. Please refer to the contact names below as needed during that week.  I can be reached at my home number (281-370-8568) if necessary.  DPR     Chris Abel   x33102  MPR     David Maxwell  x36983  Gas Operations   Bob Hall   x36956 Leslie Reeves  x37962 Jeff Gossett   x37306  Power Operations  Stacey White  x31870 Leslie Reeves  x37962  Canadian Operations  Peggy Hedstrom  403-974-6753  I will be back in the office on Wednesday, December 27 through Friday, December 29.  I will also be in for part of the day on Tuesday, December 26. Although that is an Enron holiday, there will be appropriate logistics personnel and book administrators in the office to support trading activities that day. 
 Patti will send you on Monday a draft of a memo regarding publishing the DPR during the holidays.  Please review it and make sure that the commitments we are making can be met by London.  Let me know if anything needs to be changed or if there is further clarification needed in the notes, keeping in mind that with the audience on the memo that I want it to be short and easy.  Your comments/suggestions are welcomed and needed before I send this out later next week.  Thanks. --sally 
 Great to hear from you.  I was thinking about you today.  I will look forward to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working together.  I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally 
 The Analyst/Associates Program plans to send the PRC reps a final listing of the PRC results by Tuesday, December 19th.  They asked that we not communicate results until after that date.  I did not write down all results from the meeting, so I would be glad to let you know, but would prefer to wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me before doing so.  Both Remi and Don Black were able to add to my discussion around Erwin, so he was well respresented in the process.  I am scheduled to be out on vacation next week, but I will check e:mail messages from home and will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results. Hope that you enjoy the holidays.  I will be back at work right after Christmas.  -Sally 
 FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi below. 
 I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting started.  I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office dedication, so I did not call!  Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday. My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the week between Christmas and New Years.  I wouldn't recommend taking your time during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.  Wish I could send you with a shopping list for me!! 
 Thanks for the heads up.  I will be here all day tomorrow.  --Sally 
 I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.  Since it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a good decision.  I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for the family next week that I can use it. 
 I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to busts.  I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.  Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your efforts.  --Sally 
 I left Mike a message telling him that I was forwarding this to you and that someone on your team would verify this information and get  back to him.  His note asks for info back by Friday the 17th - Friday is the 15th and I assume that is the deadline that he intends.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Cathy, I plan to be on vacation next week and therefore will not be at the December 18th staff meeting. 
 Thanks for looking into this and getting back to me.  Let me know the final resolution on this one. 
 I meant to blind copy you on this.  Here it is... 
 Please use my office for the interviews on November 4th.  My office is EB3389.  If you need additional offices, you could contact several of my direct reports who have offices:  Brent Price, Brenda Herod, Bob Hall, Mary Solmonson and James Scribner.  --Sally 
 Yes, you are nuts!  I can't believe that you already have so many gingerbread houses made.  The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely the easy route on that one.  I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow. -Sally 
 Sally,  Please let Cynthia know that Sally is out of town recruiting today.  I did speak to someone in her office (I thought it was her assistant) and Bobbie Power a week or two ago to let them know that Sally would not be available on this date.  Sally does, however, want to be a part of this group, so please notify us for the next meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally's assistant) 
 The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 I will interviewing on campus for the Analyst Program on Monday and Tuesday, October 30 and 31.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I can be reached.  I will have my cell phone with me (713-417-1591) and I will check messages as we have breaks in the interview schedule during the day.   I will be back in the office on Wednesday, November 1.  In my absence, please contact the following persons regarding trading operations issues:  Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306 Bob Hall  x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962  Power Operations Stacey White x31870 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Shona Wilson x39123  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest (global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am copying them on this memo.  When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet macros. 
 Thanks for your note.  I was great to meet you - I am glad that you could take the time out of the office to make the trip to Houston.  I will look forward to seeing you when I am next in London.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. (Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road until Brenda returns.  Let me know.  I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true. If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry. Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you have heard anything on this. 
 You got the right one -- thanks for telling me, but I already knew that without your having to tell me.  I cherish having sisters and love you very much too.  (Okay, maybe one of you is more cherished than the other, but don't tell Cara I said that!) 
 Cary, thanks for the response.  We will keep your name on the list and will contact you for any spring events.  --Sally 
 We can't wait to see the three of you.  Tammy and Tyler will be at home on Wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you.  Meagan has drill team practice after school until 4:45 and she drives herself home and Amanda rides the bus home after school, arriving about 4:30.  Mo will be in Houston while you are here.  If it still works with your plans, I thought that I would take the day off on Friday, November 3 so that you, Paul, David and I could do something fun with Rebecca and Tyler.  The football game is that evening at 7:00.  I had also thought about arranging a lunch on Thursday (downtown - Irma's?) either for us with Mo, or even to expand that to include a bunch of ex-First City folks.  Mark Wilson, James Scribner, Chuch Randall and Charles Delacey all work here for Enron.  We could call MG Shetty, and with you and Mo and me, it would be quite a reunion.  Let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things and I will arrange whatever sounds good to you.  Our phone numbers are: Home  281-370-8568 Sally's Office   713-853-5926 David's Cell:  713-299-1436 Sally's Cell:    713-417-1591 
 Very belated reply - I am cleaning up old e:mails today, and came across this one that I had not answered.  Commercial does not sign confirmations at this point.  Too many to make that practical these days.  When I started the confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing confirms at that time. Once they knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me.  In the early days of power, the traders once again were signing confirms.  Obviously interested in the details of every deal that was done.  But as the business grew, that too changed.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/17/2000 07:53 PM 
 Thanks for the note.  I remembered that you will be coming in from London. Hope the trip is uneventful.  Sunday evening will not be lengthy, as I am sure that you will be tired. 
 I hope that you have fun (are marathon and fun mutally exclusive terms?!). We will see you on Monday.  --Sally 
 I would like to formulate the breakout groups prior to the forum.  I would like your input on likely persons to put together in these breakout sessions.  Let's talk tomorrow. 
 I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs for Energy Operations in ENA.   Frank is working on a contract basis at this time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.  I have given Sheila my feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank than I have had.  Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with Frank.  Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.   Thanks for taking the time to do this. 
 Thanks.  I have shared these with Jeff Gossett (gas risk lead) and Scott Earnest (products risk lead).  I will be curious to hear about the plan that your DBA's have devised today.  Thanks for you help and attention to these problems. 
 See names below for your IT contacts tonight - one on 32 and one on 31.  Do you know these folks?  They should be visibly on your floors.  Let me know if that doesn't happen.  --Sally 
 FYI - handled 
 I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday.  My dad is experiecing serious health problems, and he will be in Houston on Friday for an appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be going to the doctor's appointment with my dad.  Depending upon waiting room time, I may not be in the office for the 1:30 meeting in EB3305 to discuss the findings from the recent internal audit projects.  I have asked Shona Wilson to attend in my place.  Please continue with the meeting, as I know that this is a difficult meeting to schedule.  I will get an update from Shona when I get back to the office. 
 Attached - still not quite final - waiting for confirmation from Tom Gros and Philippe Bibi.   Can we add an Enron logo to the top of the first page? Thanks.    I also sent this version to Mike Jordan, Fernley Dyson and Shona for their input.  Can you e:mail a copy to Tom Hopwood?  Thanks. 
 My details to Jeff and Sherri 
 My details to Bill Bradford... 
 My details to Ted ... 
 Thanks for the heads up. 
 My details to Rick and Sharron...

 Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller Forum.  Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting. All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business).  Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.   You and I talked about Monday or Tuesday afternoon, October 23 or 24.  I have tentatively put you on the agenda over lunch on Tuesday as detailed below. I hope that you can join us for lunch and address the group either before or after you eat - your choice on that.  I will call Peggy to check on your schedule, and if this does not work we can rearrange.  Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000 Time:  Noon (lunch will be served from 12:00 to 1:30) Place:  The Warwick Hotel The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 5701 Main Street Houston,  TX  77005  I have noted that your topic will be Technology's vision for supporting global trading operations.  I know that the group would also like to hear about what is going on in Enron Networks.  We can alter the topic as you would like. Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us. 
 Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller Forum.  I know that we are catching you before a tee time on Monday, so I especially appreciate your joining us to kick off the event that morning. Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business).  Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.   You are scheduled to address the group as follows:  Date:  Monday, October 23, 2000 Time:  8:00 am (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us) Place:  The Warwick Hotel The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 5701 Main Street Houston,  TX  77005  With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this group would be:  recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 2000 your support for global standards for operational controls for trading activities your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions your challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and controls as Enron's growth as a trading organization continues  Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.

Any references that you could make to the importance of information flow between RAC and operations would be great to cover.  Feel free to offer up a challenge to the group.  I hope that you will be able to join us for the tour of Enron Field and for dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace on Monday evening.  The tour is at 6:00 and dinner is at 7:00.

Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this group would be:  recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 2000  the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure integrity in mid and back office functions  the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that)  the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to "raise the flag" on issues if needed 
 As promised, although a little later than expected, a draft agenda is attached at the end of my memo to Mike.  The memo will walk you through the agenda.  Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Again, I an sorry that you will not be able to join us, but I am pleased that so many others from the London office will be in attendance.  --Sally 
 FYI - would love to have your comments or suggestions 
 FYI re: schedule 
 What is the latest on this one?  I gather that they are still using spreadsheets, which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.  Are their positions not being captured and aggregated?  What does Scott Mills have to say about this?  --Sally 
 Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short "state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the afternoon.  Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going project.  Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker. He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office services within Enron.  Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic. Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group. After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's attendance. 
 Thanks -- 3:00 pm Thursday sounds great.  On 21 I assume?  I will see you there. 
 I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday, October 20.  My dad is experiencing serious health problems, and he is coming to Houston for a doctor's appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be going with him to the appointment.  I will have my cell phone with me (713-417-1591) and I will check messages throughout the day.  In my absence, please contact the following persons on Friday regarding trading operations issues:  Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306 Bob Hall  x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962  Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Mike Moscoso x35242  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team for their team building next Wednesday.  Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another night that week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the names and numbers.  I have just called and talked with Jonathan Beck and Jenia Nikolova; have left voice mail messages of congratulations for Jeremy Fitzpatrick, Matthew Olney, David Scott, Corrinn Sutton, and Thomas Underwood; and left a message with a roommate for Ryan White.  I did not get an answer of any kind when I tried Thomas Lowell's number.  He is the only one that I have not contacted at this point.  I will try his number again before I leave tonight.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I am open from 3:00 to 4:00 on Thursday - have to meet with Enron's legal counsel from Sydney at 4:00, followed by a 4:30 meeting with Delainey on a proposed asset sale.   I have rescheduled my meeting with the Sydney guy several times this week, and I think this may be my last shot of meeting with him during this trip.  Is an hour sufficient?  --Sally 
 FYI - Let's discuss 
 Thanks for passing along the announcement.  You are right, the grapevine news did precede this more formal annoucement!  Sounds as if this will be a fun position for you.  Thanks for all of the great work that you have done on behalf of mid and back office operations.  Your help in Helsinki earlier this year was especially wonderful.  I will call you when I next come to London and will hope that you will have time for lunch or dinner to catch up. --Sally 
 I will be there on the 25th.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Trena,  3:00 PM is fine.  Patti 
 In cleaning up e:mails, I ran across this one that I had not yet read.  Has James called and talke with you about Enpower?  Are his concerns in the memo accurate?  Let me know.  --Sally 
 Trena,  Per our earlier conversation, I have scheduled a meeting with you and Sally for 3:30 - 4:00 PM today (Wednesday, October 18) in her office at EB 3389.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 (Sally's Assistant) 
 I could go to Austin the night of Wednesday, October 25 for dinner with students if you need me.  Let me know.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Irfan was one of the UT students, not OU.  Just wanted to make sure that we have him on the right list.    Enron North America Corp. 
 The 13th won't work for me, unfortunately.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite meeting from Tuesday evening (Sept. 12) through Friday (Sept. 15).  If you were to arrive early enough on Tuesday, we could try to do the review before I catch the plane on Tuesday afternoon.  The only problem with that is that the VP/MD PRC is scheduled for September 11 and 12.  I don't know that the VP portion of the PRC will be completed on Monday, or that the results would be available to me on Tuesday even if the process is completed on Monday.  We have been asked to hold VP reviews until after the PRC process is completed.  I will contact you as soon as I do have the results from the PRC and we will set up a specific time for the review, either in Houston or Calgary.  Seems like it would be a good time of year for me to head north!  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 09/05/2000 12:15 PM 
 The Associates PRC was completed on Monday, July 24.  As the PRC rep, I will communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.  I received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on vacation.  I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your performance review and the ranking.  In your case, I would guess that Jean and your new supervisor will have to work out which one (or both) will do your review.  --Sally 
 The Associates PRC meeting has been rescheduled for Monday, July 24th at 9:00 am.  I have also sent an e:mail message to the associates letting them know about the new date. 
 We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results. Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.  Thanks for providing your resumes.  I will feel more informed during the process. 
 Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as soon as I know a rescheduled date.  In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in Houston.  My extension is 35926. 
 Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30.  If possible, I would love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home.  The first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am.  I could easily be in Norman for a 9:00 am interview.  I can also stay for interviews on October 31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or treating with a 2 year old).  I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.  I would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU this last time.  I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago office.  I will let you know what I hear back from him.  Consider Shona Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & 31. Finally, I have noted November 10 on my calendar for the management overview.  Keep me posted on details.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Today's Enron-wide Associates PRC meeting has been cancelled.  It was scheduled to start at 1:30 today, following the Analysts PRC.  Apparently, the Analysts PRC is running long.  Since both meetings were scheduled for the same location and with Joe Sutton as the chair, the Associates PRC has been cancelled.  I do not yet have a rescheduled date.  I will let you know when I do.  I am also sending an e:mail message to the Associates that I am representing so that they will informed of the cancellation.  Thanks for taking the time to meet or talk with me about the performance of your respective associate in preparation for the PRC. 
 I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will take place on July 19.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates to represent in the meeting as indicated on the attachment.  The Associates Program has provided me  with your name as the PRC supervisor of the associate as listed.    Please provide me with the following by Friday, July 14:  Associate's accomplishments for the first half of 2000 (prepared by the associate or summarized by you)  Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any additional rotational assignments during this first six months of the year)  Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues)  Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately representing the associate in the PRC process  Recommendation for promotion, if any  I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP system through the Associates Program.  I will be on vacation until Monday, July 17.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, will be contacting you next week to ask if you would like to meet with me for a few minutes on Monday or Tuesday, July 17 and 18 (or phone call) to discuss your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC supervisor for the associate listed on the attachment,  please reply by e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go next for this input. 
 I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London.  Pulp & paper is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.  I would not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.  We did review him in our PRC.  For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper employees by putting them under Global Products rather than ENA, a step they took I believe without any outside direction.  Does this make sense to you? --Sally

 I hope that your holiday was wonderful.  Nikki told me that you would be working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.  I will try to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 to about 7:15.  I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning. 
 Sorry this took so long...  Sally says put her on our Co #413, RC # 0813 for now.  Also, she would like Angelique's resume as soon as possible.  Sally is in Calgary but she asked me to fax it to her as soon as I get it, so tomorrow would be great.  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some options on housing. 
 Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU.  Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally 
 We did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.  I have also discussed this at length with Brent, and agree that the shift of manager positions to front to back looks across each region (eliminating the OA and Deal Validation manager roles) makes sense.  Upon the recommendation of Susan and Brent, I am comfortable with appointing Jeff Gossett as the manager of the West region. 
 Approved. Sally 
 Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.  For a woman who can't remember the last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy!  Thanks, too, for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two days.  I will take that home with me tonight and I will enjoy it during my upcoming days off.  I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.  Thanks for your enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless effort.  It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be fun.  1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - a direct result of your contributions.  I look forward to meeting new challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together. 
 As of Friday, October 13, it seems that this student had not heard back from Enron.  What is the timeline for getting back to students regarding Super Saturday? 
 I have this on my calendar and I will be there.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Glad you could make it yesterday.  I don't play (at least not in front of others), so I do look for golfers from time to time.  I will keep your number handy!    Enron Capital Management 
 Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail is much better.  I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be MUCH better.  I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday. 
 Did you get to check on lunch plans for Thursday or Friday next week with directs?  This looks like it could conflict. 
 If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am on Friday?  That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews (defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess - the signed review).  The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.  Although many employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time. Thanks.  Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is the case we may be alright without the review.  But getting a second copy from Clara would probably be the best bet.  Thanks. 
 11th grade ticktocker meeting details:  Location:   Home of Kristen and Nancy Dipaulo (check my spelling on this one!)

 I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.  I would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town.  I have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.  Part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and from around the world.  If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will probably be enhanced.  This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.  I hate the Sunday thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.  Please let Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate. 
 I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her resume.  Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in November.  I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation, and was impressed with her.  She has followed up with phone calls and this e:mail.  I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company.  Her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies. --Sally 
 I was in Austin the end of last week recruiting at UT and (in a sense of open-mindedness and fair play) was at OU on Sunday night and Monday recruiting as well. James and I have not had a chance to talk following your conversations.  Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages.  I have some tight deadlines on a couple of things for Friday, so it may be Monday before James and I have the opportunity to talk in any detail. 
 I did find one that I have not used.  You will just need to change the information at the top of the page. 
 Attached is your actual form.  I did not have a totally blank one to forward, as I have actually done work on all evals on my disk.  So I am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template.  Hope this works! 
 Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers. However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.  The remainder are senior specialists.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail.  We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these players away.  Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our competitor, which will require that he have good people.  He will be moving to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire. He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or childless, their mobility factors could be high.  Enron would not want to lose any other talent to Steve's new employer. 
 Thanks for forwarding this contact list.  You should add my contact information to the list as well and redistribute to the team.  Thanks.  Office 713-853-5926 Home 281-370-8568 Cell  713-417-1591 
 Thanks for asking me.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet your team and to talk with them. 
 I hope that you got my reminder message that I was attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting today, which kept me from attending the ENW staff meeting over lunch today.  My remaining PRC obligations are as follows:  Friday, Dec. 8   Energy Operations PRC   8:00 am until ?

 Thanks for the note, and thanks, too, for taking time on both days to talk with us.  You should hear from Lexi soon regarding the Super Saturday event. 
 It was a pleasure to meet you and to talk with someone who knows ERCOT, PJM, etc.!  Thanks for taking the time on both Wednesday and Thursday to visit with us.  You should be hearing from Lexi soon regarding our Super Saturday event.

 Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk about how we can jump start this.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps! 
 Please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list.  Thanks. 
 I always compile a contact list for Energy Operations during the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years).  Just let me know who appropriate contacts will be, especially for the DPR and MPR, during the dates that you are out.  Sounds as if you should see a white Christmas!  --Sally 
 Good input on those leather pants.  I can just picture her shopping.  We will look forward to seeing you for lunch on Saturday.  The weather looks as if it should be good for the game that night.  See you soon!

 Save the date!  October 22-24  has been reserved for the Enron-wide Operations Controller Forum to be held in Houston at the Warwick Hotel.  To accommodate the desired travel schedule of our attendees outside the Houston office, the forum will kick-off the evening of Sunday, October 22.  We will have a full day and evening on Monday, October 23, and the forum will conclude mid-afternoon on Tuesday, October 24.  Many key Enron players will join us for portions of the forum.  Speakers confirmed to date are Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford.  Details will follow in the next few days.  All hotel accommodations will be arranged by Patti and charges for these will be absorbed by my cost center. Please make your own airline reservations.  I look forward to seeing you at the forum.  This will be a unique opportunity to get know your counterparts from the wholesale, retail, and broadband segments of Enron, with contingents from the U.S., Canada, England, Australia, and Japan.  Sally 
 Thanks for looking into this for me.    Enron North America Corp. 
 It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made. His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and we will let you know when and where that will take place.  Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all aspects of this key business for North America.  Please join me in congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities. 
 FYI...I will keep you posted. 
 While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs.  I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions. And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.  While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you.  Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways to turn this around. 
 Attached is a memo that I have sent to Mike Jordan regarding the Operations Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.  I want to send the official invitation early next week.  I have conferred with Mike on attendees from EEL.   Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is finalized.  Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.  Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.  If you can come, I would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.  Just let me know.  Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his participation.  I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.  Hope you have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Good memo - let me know if you see results.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Peggy, is the EOL bridge functionality working for you in Calgary?  Jeff Gossett was in a meeting with me on Monday this week discussing systems issues.  Beth Perlman mentioned that the EOL bridging had been completed, but Jeff spoke up and said that it was not working correctly.  You or someone on your team may want to call Jeff to understand the issues that he was having to be certain that you are happy with the functionality that you now have in Calgary.  Thanks.     Peggy Hedstrom 09/28/2000 12:11 PM 
 I will be recruiting at Wellsley College for the Analyst Program on Thursday, September 28.  I will fly back from Boston on Friday, September 29 and I should be back in the office between 11:30 and 12:00.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.  While I am out of the office, the following persons will serve as key contacts:  Gas Operations  Bob Hall  x36956 Leslie Reeves x37962 Steve Jackson x37070  Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Mike Moscoso x35242  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 FYI 
 4 counterparties for a total of $10.2MM makes me think that each one must be pretty large.  I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars are associated with each one -- also how likely we think that collection is in each case.  Leslie:  I know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at this point to provide this kind of detail, but it is the type of question that Dave may ask. 
 Decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her.  I suppose that if she wants others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake that we can!  (Do you think that we will be invited?)  That really sounds ugly, and I don't mean it to.  I think that your idea was a great one, but if she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.  Let me know when the deliberation process is completed!  --Sally 
 This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for sending the dates in writing.  We already have this on our home calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.  I did confirm that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.  The weather should be great here then.  I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do something fun with the kids -- zoo, Children's Museum, etc.  I sent Mo an e:mail message about your stay in Houston in hopes that she may need to be in Houston at that time.  I will let you know what I hear from her. 
 Is this a timeline for all of ENA, or just for the accounting group? 
 Hope are things in London?  I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here she will be about six months pregnant.  I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, who was on his first day here.  We could also schedule a First City reunion if you could be here.  If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects for a lunch or happy hour.  I may need to head to London in October or November.  I will let you know if my travel plans develop.  I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain climbing!!!!!!!  How was it?  I will be anxious to hear.  --Sally 
 I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  --Sally 
 Thanks for following up on this. 
 This is hilarious!  I am laughing outloud!! 
 This request is approved.  Your request forms that you send still don't provide enough information in layman's terms so that I know what you are asking to be approved.  Are we working on this? 
 I can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved. Since Gregory's address looks as if he is at Corp., just let me know who he is and what I am being asked to approve.  Please reply with history attached.  Thanks. --Sally 
 This is fine.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 FYI - yes, my response was lengthy! 
 Would you please forward a copy of our current draft of operating standards to Shawn?  Thanks. 
 Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.  In fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices worldwide, a "what time is it there if I am here" page, etc.  I would like for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan widely at this point.  However, I thought that I would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts. 
 Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a row, January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for you?  And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon!! 
 I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?  Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave you some.  --Sally 
 This employee, and his supervisor, Bob Schorr, do not report in to me. Someone else should be approving this requested access. 
 Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that he is doing better.  I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will be very interested in the gosipy details.  Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 27 packages of fudge. 
 Geynille,  Sally will not be able to attend Sept. 27 Intern offer dinner, but will attend presentation dinner on Sept. 28.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Thanks for your list.  I have talked with Brent and of the three names that you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their locations - weather, coal, etc.  I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully decline! 
 Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate party!)  We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan.  We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you have a list of what is available for those schools? 
 Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio November 15-17.  Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save the date than to provide any detail at this point).  If you have not received your invitation, please let me know. 
 It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.  I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have done a great job in changing and promoting the program.  I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully with a change in our strategy!  If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold.  On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know -- we can probably place a few orders through you! 
 Please put this on my calendar.  I don't know if I will make it there, but I would like for it to be on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Yes, he is working on the short list.  I do have to say, however, that I have not had questions from him on any of those names.  I will leave him a voice mail message for an update. 
 I know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had anticipated in SAP.  I also know that there are several things where we have to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in SAP.  We also have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within SAP and a mismatch of that timing with our business processes.  There was a concerted effort kicked off by the SAP team last week to try and identify and resolve issues.  They met with my direct reports.  However, we have to reconvene as we ran out of time to cover all issues!  I have asked Leslie Reeves and Bryce to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully understand how much of this issue was attributable to human versus system.  I will get back with you as I know more details and as I can share with you our list of first "hits" for SAP fixes or enhancements.  Thanks for sharing this with me.  --Sally 
 I have read this series of e:mails but I am not sure that I fully understand the issue.  Did Willie not do his job?  Are there problems with how SAP works?  Are both of these an issue?  Please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with SAP and netting.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Debbie,  FYI, Sally Beck will be flying up afternoon of Sept. 28.  Please make her reservation for 28th only.  Also, do you have the address of Stone Davis Hall where dinner & presentation will be held?  I need that for her itinerary. And lastly, can you put me on cc: list for Wellesley info.  It's just makes it easier for me.  Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally Beck's Assistant) 
 As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by approximately 10:00 am Houston time.   Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London requirement for officialized books.  The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time. We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report earlier in the morning.  Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London. 
 I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report. After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format.  In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation. --Sally 
 Geynille,  Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28. Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Diana,  Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru. If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.  She will be in training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is available.  ID:    sbeck Password:   balc33balc Lotus password:   balc33balc H:\ drive mapping:  "nahou-uv3"  I submitted SRRS for "in sync" two or three weeks ago. Let me know if you need anything else. Patti Thompson x39106 
 This employee and his/her manager, Bob Schorr, do not report in to me.  This approval should be sent to someone else. 
 I will take a look at my calendar and let you know when I can come north.  I am heading to the airport in 5 minutes for a flight to Austin to make a presentation at UT tonight, capping off about four weeks with a lot of travel for me.  I will catch my breath on the plan and look at my schedule for the next few weeks and I will let you know.  I sat by Sheila Knudsen at the ENA staff meeting on Friday afternoon last week, and asked her if we should now schedule VP reviews.  The VP PRC meeting (much rescheduled) did take place on September 11 and 12.  Sheila said that as of Friday (the 15th) that HR had not received the final results from the PRC, and that we should wait on reviews until we had that in hand.  I will check with HR this week so see if all is finalized, so that we can schedule the review.  I will keep you posted.     Peggy Hedstrom 09/20/2000 12:18 PM 
 Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes. Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and organizational work.  I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.  Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated 
 This approval request is incomplete - it does not include the name of this employee's manager.  I do not know the employee, and without the name of the manager I can't possibly approve this.  Please get someone to complete this request.

 I am not trying to twist any arms with this question, but is there anything we can do so that Jody can make the presentation at OU?  Since he was the top graduate from the Energy Management Program at OU, it would be great for him to be at the presentation next Tuesday night.  I know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing, but it is also time well spent.  I do know that Jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him I will understand.  I just wanted you to take a look at this.  Thanks. 
 Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch! Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)  Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week - really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have been doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be off the week of December 18th. 
 I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President. This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.  It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and above.  Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project!  Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.  You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.  Sally 
 I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.  I will leave the offsite meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common needs around risk systems.  I will be in the office the afternoon of September 15.  Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I can be reached.  Key contacts while I am out are listed below:  Natural Gas Operations  Steve Jackson   x37070 Bob Hall   x36956 Leslie Reeves  x37962 Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870 Leslie Reeves  x37962  DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242 MPR      David Maxwell  x36983 
 Please print and start a file for me for year-end PRC 2000. Yikes!! Thanks. 
 I am not aware of an Enron-wide issue, but it would seem strange that two such instances occurred within your group.  You may want to contact someone in security to give them the details so that they can investigate. 
 Yes, Mary Solmonson from Energy Operations has volunteered to host a student in the Job Shadowing program.  Mary may have one of her directors host the student.  Please use Mary Solmonson as the primary contact for this program. Her extension is 36079.  Thanks.     Susan Skarness 09/12/2000 02:45 PM 
 Who are these guys and should someone from our group meet with them? 
 Great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon on OPM.  The presentation and your comments were direct and concise.  And your delivery of the information was very well done -- you were poised, organized, prepared and confident.  It was an effective and informative presentation to the group.  Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project. 
 I was out of town last week doing some recruiting, so I am just reading your e:mail today.  I have passed this along to Lisa Cousino and she should be getting back to you.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
 This came in while I was in Austin last week, so I am just reading it today. Any thoughts on this one?  --Sally

 January 27th and February 24th sound good.  Meagan has a big dance on Jan. 27th, and I need to be here to help with prep and to take pictures.  February 17th is our anniversary (22nd!!), so that is probably not a good date either.  So if you can make one of the other two dates work, I would love to come.  Just keep me posted. 
 We will need this, so I am sending it to you as well.  --sally 
 Does this make sense to you?  Seems like they may have the wrong person.  Can you follow up?  Thanks. 
 Please set up a 30 minute meeting for me with Dave.  Thanks.=20 
 Thanks for you message.  I am glad to know that you like what you see in the office to date.  I am planning a trip to Chicago soon, so I will look forward to seeing you there.

 It was good to see you last week, too.  That was a big group, and there were many people that I just passed in the halls!  I would love to participate, but I will be out of town on September 14.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite meeting from Septemer 13-15 in San Antonio.  Thanks for thinking of me. --Sally 
 Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for Clickpaper.com.  Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that effort as well.  I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on their efforts and yours.  Welcome to Enron.  It was nice to meet you last week.  --Sally

 I already have a meeting scheduled for Friday from 2:00 to 2:30.  I will join you in the facilitator training as soon as that meeting concludes--it may not last a full 30 minutes.  In case I can not make the meeting, I have printed the attachment.  Thanks. 
 I would like to participate in this focus group, however, I will be returning from Austin on Friday morning following the Enron scholarship dinner the night before.  I am scheduled to land at Hobby at 8:45 am.  It is unlikely that I will be in the Enron Building before about 9:15, and I am scheduled to go into a meeting at 9:30 that involves a number of players and would be difficult to reschedule.  If your responses from participants for the Friday session is thin, and you schedule another time, please let me know.  I have been out of the office on business for the last several days (recruiting at UT yesterday) and returned mid-morning today to a full schedule.  I am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond by noon today as you had asked.  --Sally 
 I have confirmed your attendance with your assistant.  Please notify me if you are unable to attend.

 Thanks for the resume.  I have been out of town the last several business days, so I am just now catching up on e:mails.  David told me that he ran into you at lunch.  Small world...  How are things going for you?  I hope that this was a good move for you. --Sally 
 Brenda,  Sally is out of the office today.  Patti x39106 
 October 20th sounds great -- we will reserve the guest room for you! 
 Please print all attachments for me.  Thanks. 
 I was able to get into the application this time.  I could see the request for Shona on the screen and I clicked "Approval".  The status did not change from pending and there was no pop up on the screen that indicated that the request was processed.  So I do not know if this worked. 
 Sally is in Dallas for an offsite - she will return to office Friday (Sept 1).  If you can forward contract to me, I will see that she signs it asap.  Patti x39106 EB 3388

 Please set up a meeting with Steve and Beth as soon as we can.  I believe that Beth is out sick at the present. 
 I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to "catch up", if you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going basis.  I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled.  I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible. 
 Here are the home games when Meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine:  Friday, September 15  7:00 pm  Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm  Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming)  There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.  I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.  Patti has sent you a copy of my itinerary. 
 Shona,  I printed 12/4 consolidated report for Sally.  It is again very small.  Any possibility that you can change format to enlarge (very large margins).  I can go in every time & reformat, but it seems a waste of time to do every time when you can just change your template once.  PT    Enron North America Corp. 
 I'm trying again! 
 I think that we sent this to the wrong e:mail address at first... 
 Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.  These days with Mom and Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.  That way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to come up.  Hopefully, never needed!  Have a great time in New York later this week.  I sent you a newspaper article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave. 
 I will be in Dallas from Tuesday, August 29 through Thursday, August 31 at an offsite session hosted by Rick Causey to review the SAP implementation and next steps.  The linkage of Unify and our Global Databases to SAP is a critical one, and decisions around next steps can impact these operating systems and our processes.  Therefore, Rick has asked that I attend.  Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), has telephone numbers where I can be reached if needed.  In my absence, please contact the following persons in Houston with questions.  Peggy Hedstrom is the appropriate contact in Calgary.  Natural Gas Operations  Steve Jackson   x37070 Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870  DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242 MPR      David Maxwell  x36983  I will be back in the office on Friday, September 1. 
 I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on Friday evening.  Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group. His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe. Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four year-old daughter.  Several of us will be attending the funeral today.  Over the past several weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic association.  Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded. 
 Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B. on any of this?  It might be helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two additional paper mills that we may purchase.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I have let Lexi know that I have a conflict with this meeting time -- I will be doing a business review meeting with Jeff Skilling on global risk management operations at 10:00 on September 7th.  I just wanted you to know that I continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at OU.  I have asked Lexi to update me on the meeting.  --Sally 
 I can't make 10:00 on September 7th.  I have a business review meeting scheduled with Jeff Skilling at that time.  FYI:  Bob Klein has resigned from the company effective August 31.  Let me know what I miss in the meeting. Thanks.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp.

 I will be at the presentation.  I can not make a faculty lunch that day -- it's my mother's birthday and she lives in Austin, so I have already committed to lunch with her.  Just let me know the details on how soon you would like for me to arrive at the Alumni Center, and if there is anything else that I can do.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for letting us know about Blake.  I just tried to reach him and left a congratulatory message on his answering machine. 
 Wow - thanks for copying me on these.  --Sally 
 Let's let her float in that vision for a while... 
 It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.  After you have received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested.  I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.  I will reserve judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses. 
 Not too mountainous, but I am sure that would be fun.  It's kind of hard to fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that could be tough.  Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  We are having a great year here at Enron, especially in the business unit that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for everyone. 
 No manager is listed below on this request and I don't know the employee. The manager blank must be completed for me to be able to address these. Without that, I can't possibly tell what group this person is working in and whether or not it makes sense to grant the system access.  Please return this to me for my approval when complete. 
 FYI - I responded to Sharron.

 In cleaning up e:mails, I can across this one from Sheila.  Is this one of the corrections that was made to the June information?  Any update on July? Thanks. 
 The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process along with Peggy and Brent.)  On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your calendars:  November 15-17.  Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these. 
 Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense. While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good option.  I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a note then if there are any other comments that I have.  I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person sometime in the not too distant future.  Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join us. 
 I am not available to interview on December 7th.  I will be in a PRC meeting.  Try me next time!  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Do you know who this is?  I don't recognize the manager's name.  Thanks. 
 I received the note about the Wellesley recruiting team meeting on Thursday. I will look forward to seeing you there.  Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?  I will be there.  I did let Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the teachers.  With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so that I can best support her in school.  Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team will be there for the duration.  I look forward to seeing you there, too! --Sally 
 On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's cars.  On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of money for a school project.  Last night, the magazine made it into my hands around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.  What a nice article!  I smiled while reading it.  How nice to see your accomplishments recognized in print.  Congratulations.  I hope that you have plenty of copies for your mom and dad.  --Sally 
 Glad you got some rain.  We are still doing lots of watering on the yard.  No water rationing in our area yet, but it has been put in place in many areas in and around Houston.  I have to be in Austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on September 5, so I thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and have lunch for your birthday.  I haven't made flight reservations yet, but I am sure that I can work it to be at the University Club by 12:15.  Looks as if the whole family will go to Hallettsville on the 9th.  David and I will enjoy the drive, and I am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on the way over! 
 Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.  It does not work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put into production?  I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally okayed the access for Bob Hall.  Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system is fixed.  My number is 35926.  I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and timing. 
 I will be at the meeting on the 24th. 
 Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.  Beverly Scott, with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.  She offered to call all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.  I was planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that I decided to take her up on it.  She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a list of names and numbers).  I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't called everyone on the list.  I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I know that she is working on it.  Just a little more slowly than I would like!  I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today and make calls.  Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.  Her number at work is 281-444-0751. 
 I met with Karen Marshall today.  She is in the Community Relations group and is organizing the dinner on September 7th.  I suggested that she add to the invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this summer).  I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know people at the school. I will keep you posted.  --Sally 
 Was Lisa a recent hire that Susan Harrison brought in?  I don't immediately recognize her name, but wonder if that's who this is.  Also, I left you a message about Bob Klein's resignation, as I learned from Jeff Sorenson.  I am sure that Jeff has communicated this to you.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please print the attachment for me in color ( I have to put that burnt orange on my bulletin board), put this event on my calendar and research flight information for me.  I would fly over on the afternoon of the 7th and back on the morning of the 8th.  Check with Karen to see if she is handling hotel reservations, or if we should make those.  Thanks. 
 Please print this memo and attachments in color for me.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Thanks for the follow up.  Please move forward with this offer with the sign on payment.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  Please let me know if these look like the final ones.  Thanks for your help.  Patti x39106 
 This was sent for my approval.  The manager listed below does not work in Energy Operations.  This should be sent to someone else for approval. 
 Same time, same place -- just not as often!  I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global Markets.  I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time together on an as needed basis. 
 If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in response from others. But do let me know... 
 I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has for you. I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work for me.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I like the trip idea better than a party, personally, so I am glad that Mom and Dad seemed to like that alternative.  And in June, I think that the mountains sound great.  I have a preference for Western mountains -- big, open sky  (Grand Tetons could be great), but if Mom pictures North Carolina as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) that look nice.  I will see if I can find the names of those places.  Thanks for pursuing this with Mom and Dad.  --Sally 
 The record on Friday showed that 127 employees from Energy Operations had pledged dollars to the United Way campaign.  Large number, but still percentage-wise smaller than we would like.  I sent the message below to all Energy Operations employees on Friday afternoon.  We'll see in a few days if this helped on contributions.  Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:  Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.  Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by Enron.  If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.  Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge.

 Call or e:mail - either one is great.  I do hope that you are working with James directly on these issues as they surface.  It is still not clear to me whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues.  I will always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that will insure better information.  Because I can't personally do all of the work, I just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with the right management team members on my team.  I don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work.  I believe that the manual process that moves information from the Entelligence team to GCP has apparently not worked as well as was designed.  While sorry that the results haven't been as expected, we are glad to have your input now to help address this.  James has reassigned the resources from Entelligence for now to work with Mary Gosnell on updates to GCP that I understand have been prioritized with you. 
 I am resending this memo regarding the information that I need from you as Cheryl Ingstad's supervisor as I prepare to represent her in the Associates PRC meeting next week.  I am tied up in other PRC meetings on December 7, 8 and 11, so I am doing my homework earlier rather than later this week. Please note the bullet points in the memo below which outline the information that I need.  I do have copies of the internal feedback forms and Cheryl's self-evaluation.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I know that things are very busy right now, but it is important to the Associates that their reps in the PRC process are well prepared.  Your input will help me with that.  Thanks. --Sally 
 I have this on my calendar.  At this point, I do not plan to bring anyone else to the meeting.  --Sally    Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 Sorry that I missed you this morning.  I attended that last Financial Council meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert and Rick Causey.  Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine that we didn't get to talk today.  I had wanted to be prepared on how to address out current activities there.  So I can get an update on that when we talk tomorrow.  I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00 tomorrow.   I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting. 
 I got your voice mail message and I understand your concerns around Todd's time.  I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's help would be needed.  I think that we can review the "to do" list from James and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work, etc.  As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency (remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all of the work.  I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as the contracted hired help!  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 
 I will be there!  --Sally 
 Todd is completing his short-term role on the CommodityLogic team, and it is my hope that he will be able to provide some help for you after that is completed, while also working in his role with Weather.  I have sent a message to Brent and I am sure that we will talk.  --Sally 
 As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly without the family.  Can we still use Todd ? 
 Thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program.  It will help to have that info in my meeting on Friday. 
 Cathy:  slight wording change from Rick Causey:  add words at beginning of third sentence in italics and drop the phrase "on accounting issues and reporting earnings" at the end of that third sentence.  Thanks.  Clear as mud?  --Sally   Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, business controller for Global Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business controller for Weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for Global Products and Coal.  In addition, Tom Myers has joined Brent's management team as Director of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 
 Rick:  This is a draft of the language to be used in a McConnell/Shankman memo to go out on their new organization.  I worked with Mike on the language for this paragraph.  Any comments or suggested changes? Mike would like to send this out ASAP, ideally this afternoon.  Thanks for taking a look.  draft  Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management Operations.

 Please put this on my calendar.  I assume that this every other week meeting will replace the weekly Friday meeting.  Thanks. 
 I'm glad to know that she is home.  I can just imagine how much fun those oxygen treatments will be!  I know that you will be thankful to have your whole family under the same roof.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/01/2000 05:47 PM 
 Should have sent you a copy of this... 
 As a result of the creation of the Global Markets business in the last few days, I would add the following persons to the attendee list for the ASE in Dallas:  Brent Price  VP Operations and CAO, Global Markets Tom Myers  Director of Accounting, Global Markets  Brent is in London this week, and will be on vacation the week of August 21. With the demands of a new role, Brent will be best able to address the feasibility of one or both of them attending. 
 Can you join me at this meeting?  I plan to talk with Tom Gros tomorrow to let him know that you will be the liasion with CommodityLogic for Energy Operations.  Then I thought that we could both attend this next meeting as a transition.  Then it's on your calendar after that !  --Sally 
 Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number. I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during my commute tonight again.  Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally 
 Thanks for the update on Dad.  Keep me posted on what you hear.  No, I didn't get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!  I will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from work.  --Sally 
 I am sorry that you won't be here to join us for the lunch for Kristin.  It was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine.  Since this is her last official week with ENA, I did want to do this before she starts her new assignment.  --Sally 
 I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 instead of August 28.   I will keep you posted.  I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's new role.  I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.  I am confident that this will work well. 
 FYI:  Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.  By voice mail, I suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.  We are set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over lunch.  I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.  Rick Causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.  Any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?  Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine.  --Sally 
 Life is busy at Enron and I literally receive hundreds of e:mails every week.  This is not the best way to communicate with me on priority issues.  I have looked at your proposal and would be interested in learning more.  Can you provide more details beyond your presentation?  What is your background and experience?  Can you provide information on your company? 
 I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.  If you look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.  His e:mail to Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's group.  Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest.  I don't think that HR gets involved in this process.  I am not sure how I got into this loop.  It seems that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with Nelson.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have been on jury duty since Tuesday this week - I had Patti call Chris today and let him know that I would get back with him next week.  I will keep you posted as I have time to focus on that next week.  Thanks for following up!  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Definitely clever!  I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math skills.  I will definitely look into that for Meagan.  I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the beans, but no movement on that yet!  I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz; not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs: a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season. I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs will be next week.  I will keep you posted.  Have a great weekend.  Love, Sally 
 The employee for whom access if requested is not an employee of Energy Operations.  I would assume that with his supervisor listed as Ed Baughman, that he is in a commercial origination group.  Someone else should be reviewing and approving this. 
 That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day "sucked".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily I didn't have to go that far.  Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally 
 Thanks for copying me on this.  It is interesting to see your thoughts.  I suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions. 
 Do we have these numbers for Hector? 
 Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve.  Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses. Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28. That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month.  What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late. 
 I don't know Mog Hue.  Please return this request to the person who originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.  By including the manager's name, that will help me to identify who this person is, what job they perform and whether or not the request makes sense.  I have over 400 people in my group, so without more detail on these requests it is not worth taking my time to approve these.  --Sally

 David is doing well, too.  He is working contract, having quit Burlington Resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible. Yes, Tammy is still with us.  We marked our 10 year anniversary with her in March, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in Kentucky.  I truly am blessed.  --Sally 
 Can you arrange with Bobbi?  Thanks. 
 I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th was not opened by HR.  Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for clarification on Brent Price.  This was the second e:mail that I had sent to Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.  My first message had noted for Kim that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.  Can you clarify this for me?  Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.  Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level:  Superior  Excellent Strong Satisfactory    Needs Improv.

 Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.  I saw Amy Leeand Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.  Please pass the kudos along to the rest of your team.  The theme was timely, the staging was great, the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.  (I knew the WLEC 1 answer!)  I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.  Their programs are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the children in the shelter. 
 To all Energy Operations employees:  ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth. I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.  To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will; to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools" and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses. Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input.  Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.  Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid. Thank you.  Sally 
 Can you help me on this?  Can you give me the name of someone who sends messages from ARSystem@ect.com?  To make matters even more frustrating, when I tried to e:mail back to get some clarification, I got a message that said my e:mail was undeliverable.  No contact name, no phone number, and no ability to e:mail back.  I'm stuck!!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Is there a person who can attach a name and number to this request?  I receive many requests daily and I have yet to any two alike.  Makes it tough on someone to act on these, especially when sent with a name.  When I click on the address included in this message, someone else's name comes up (Steve Beck).  I don't know who you are, what you want me to do, or if you even have the right person. 
 I can't shed any light on the topic choice.  Surely you can redirect the topic.   Brent may have more info. --Sally 
 It was great to see a friendly face!  Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in and say hello.  Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so many others.  My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is "two and a half".  What a delight he continues to be!!  I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing well.  --Sally 
 There is a problem with this process.  When Sally goes to website & enters her ID & password, steve.beck comes up - not sally.beck.  Until this is fixed, she will be unable to process these requests.  Please either fix this or find another way for her to approve.  Thanks, Patti x39106 (Sally Beck's Assistant) 
 The United Way Executive Solicitiation is underway.  You should have received an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you this year pledges should be made on line.  Mark Frevert reminded everyone at today's ENA staff meeting to complete their pledges by Tuesday, August 8.  If you have not already done so, I would encourage you to complete your pledges before Tuesday.  Patti Thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this.  Peggy:  United Way may not apply in Canada, so ignore this if not appropriate. 
 Yeah!!  Yes, staff meeting is 2:30 to 3:30 on Mondays in EB3014  - convenient for you at this point. 
 Sorry that I didn't get to call you on my way to the courthouse yesterday. I was conducting lots of business back and forth with the Houston office during the drive and just ran out of time.  We reconvene in court this morning, to have what I hope will be final deliberation on sentencing, having found the guy guilty on both counts,  (Prior to the start of a trial, the defendant must choose either judge or jury to administer the sentence if the defendant is found guilty - he chose the jury.)  I am in the office now for an 8:30 meeting with Jeff Skilling regarding the upcoming Associates PRC meeting, to which I am a rep.  If I don't get a chance to reach you today, I will call during my commute tomorrow.  --Sally  By the way, I thought that when I put "Energy Executive" as my occupation on the jury summons form, that I would be deemed to be too conservative and too corporate to be chosen for the jury.  Not the case!  In fact, Mark Koenig (Enron's EVP of Investor Relations) was summoned for jury duty on Tuesday as well, and he too was chosen to be on a different jury!  The whole thing is actually very fascinating - just bad timing for me to be out so much this week.  But then, there never is a good time. 
 Please note:  Per Sally, the 9:00 AM Doorstep meeting scheduled for Friday (tomorrow) is being shortened to 30 minutes (now 9:30-10:00 AM).  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 FYI 
 I left you a return voice mail regarding Scott.  Let me know if I did  not understand the role that you are trying to fill. I hope that Jo likes Dr. Moore.  I thought that everyone in his office was so warm and friendly.      Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 08/03/2000 11:20 AM 
 Requesting update access for what?  (can't tell from this request what it is that you want me to approve)  Is this request for Sheila Glover or Rebecca Ford?  (unclear)  Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.  Is this supposed to be her title?   She is not a trader.  She is a Business Controller.  Can you provide some clarification so that I can act upon this?  Thanks for your earlier phone message, Leola.  This is still a bad process and the information is not sufficient to give an approval. 
 Kristin will be working for EBS at the time of this class, reporting to Barry Pearce.  Please contact Kristin or Barry for the appropriate RC within EBS to charge for the fee for this class.  If you charged ENA at the time of enrollment, please reverse that charge.  Thanks. 
 To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000. His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that category. 
 Hope that the trip goes well.  It should be interesting to look at that business.  Keep me posted.  --Sally 
 This was great -- and I saw myself in a number of these!!  It must be too long -- but that is who I am right now!  --Sally 
 Can't remember at this point what the question was!  Thanks for following up -- I will call you if I remember.  --Sally 
 Did you mean to send that e:mail to me?  It was Greek to me, and I assume that the Sally it was meant for was that Sally Conover.  Feels like a Monday, doesn't it?  --Sally 
 To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge. The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.  I will be back here working after trial hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the proceedings.  I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is fulfilled!  Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.  I sat by Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve on another jury. 
 Sally is out of the office today, but checking her calendar for Wed or Thurs of that week, it looks like Wednesday, Aug 9 would be a good day for her. She or I will confirm that date with you when she returns to the office on Monday.  Patti x39106    Enron North America Corp. 
 Tom,  FYI, Sally has changed her plans slightly - She will now be back in the office Monday morning (7/31).  Patti 
 FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be back in the office on Wednesday of next week.  Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next Wednesday.  If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next. 
 I will be out of the office from Wednesday, July 26 through Friday, July 28. I am taking my older daughter on a preliminary look at colleges.  I will have my cell phone with me -- the number is 713-417-1591.   My assistant, Patti Thompson, will have hotel phone numbers where I can be reached as well.  The following persons will be key contacts for trading operations while I am out:  Natural Gas Operations  Brent Price   x37647   (7/31 & 8/1:  Steve Jackson x37070) Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870   (7/31 & 8/1:  Kristin Albrecht x34763) Financial Products Operations Sheila Glover  x33210 Coal, Pulp & Paper, LNG  Scott Earnest  x31746 Weather     Todd Hall    x31957  DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242 MPR      David Maxwell  x316983  I will be working in ENA's and MG's Chicago offices on Monday and Tuesday, July 31 and August 1.  Patti has contact numbers for me at both offices. Key contacts in Houston are those listed above, with changes noted for Gas and Power Operations on July 31 and August 1.  I will be back in the Houston office on Wednesday, August 2. 
 I will be in the Chicago office on Monday, July 31.  I will be sorry to miss a lunch at Brennan's!  Enjoy  it without me.  --Sally 
 Brenda,  Per my earlier email, Sally will be out of the office Wed-Fri of this week, so she will be unable to attend.  PT 
 Joya,  I put in on Sally's calendar.  Patti 
 FYI 
 The following persons will be in attendance at 11:30 am in EB50M on July 21st for lunch, in addition to the two of you:  Enron Employees:  Shawn Cumberland - President and COO, CALME (UT BBA; UT JD) Sally Beck - VP, ENA and Global Risk Management Operations (UT BBA; UT MBA) Brent Price - VP, ENA (UT PPA) David Mitchell - Associate (recent grad - UT MBA) Jennifer Martinez - Associate (recent grad - UT MBA) Luis Mena - Analyst (recent UT grad) Catherine Pernot (recent UT grad) Lexi Elliott - Analyst Program - UT Recruiter Christy Young - Associate Program - UT Recruiter   UT Summer Associates: Cantekin Dincerler Steven Luong Michelle Sandner Adam Thomas  UT Summer Analysts: Brenton Baxter Matt Davis Eric Efron Katherine Jett Jiyeon Kim Joanna Li Dana Lipp Amy Mohan Denise Olson Neil Rajan Angelique Woods  Thanks for making the time to attend.  This should be a great opportunity to meet with these UT students as they near the end of their summer internships with Enron. 
 Sounds like fun, and you are definitely planning ahead! 
 Flight times are good.  Please insure that my hotel reservation is for a non-smoking room.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 FYI - My reply to Peggy 
 I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night). Together we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.  We will keep you posted on both items.  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 07/19/2000 12:02 PM 
 How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can fill you in on the details in that situation.  Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary? 
 I have been traveling on business and also have just returned from vacation, so I have not yet seen the proposal that you referenced.  I will hopefully discover it as I go through my inbox in the next few days. 
 Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally 
 Please join Sally Beck, Rick Causey, David Haug and all the UT Summer Interns for lunch this Friday, July 21 at 11:30 AM.  Location will be EB 50M Dining Room.  Please RSVP to me by email or phone.  We look forward to seeing you!  Thanks, Patti x39106 Sally Beck's Assistant 
 Confirmation of date & time for UT Summer Analysts & Associates Luncheon:  Date:  Friday, July 21 Time: 11:30 AM Location: EB 50M Dining Room 
 This is my first day back from vacation.  We need to augement e:mail so that requests sent when someone is on vacation can be routed elsewhere if urgent.  This is request is approved.  Why are there so many different formats for granting systems access?  Some have an approval button, some don't.  You requested a return e:mail.  It seems as if each time I look at one of these it is different.  The status button and detail button below contain no information. 
 Bobbie,  Sally is on vacation this week, but she can be available for that meeting unless she has to travel to NYC next week.  I will put it on her calendar & will confirm with you as soon as I know more (Monday at the latest).  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Per Sally's instructions - I am forwarding this document to you.  Patti x39106 
 Is there anything that I can do to help you and Jo?  Tyler has school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but my nanny is at home with him on the other days. Would it help for her to take Albert?  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/28/2000 05:46 PM 
 James,  I didn't see your name on the distribution for this so I'm forwarding it to you.  Patti 
 Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey for reference during that process.  Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good. All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this. 
 I will be hosting a cookout at my home for OU summer interns, recently hired OU grads and the OU recruiting team on Sunday, July 30th in the late afternoon.  More details will follow soon, but I wanted to let you know the date so that you can hold this on your calendar.  I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.  And my husband will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow Sooners! 
 Thanks for the update.  I am confident that with leadership from you and attention from Bryce that AEC will be satisfied soon.  --Sally 
 Rob:  Let me know if you get feedback from AEC that does not indicate that they are getting what they need.  Susan and Bryce are both very capable and responsive, so I am confident that AEC's questions can be resolved quickly. --Sally 
 Please join us for an informal lunch on Friday, July 21st in the dining room in EB50M.   Rick Causey, Enron's executive lead for the Analyst Program, and David Haug, Enron's executive lead for the Associates Program, have been invited to join us as well.  We are interested in renewing acquaintances with those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom we did not see in the interview process.  We hope that you are enjoying your summer assignments at Enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit over lunch.  Please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch. 
 Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should be the end of July.  Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24. This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you updated on this as I get direction from him.  Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  Also please note the following:  Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process as well.) Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team, or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment.  Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a meaningful one.       It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0 
 Just a reminder for Monday to get this for me.  Too bad they didn't deliver these!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Brenda:  I mentioned to Tom that I will be on vacation the week of July 10, so I will not attend the July 12th meeting.  Please remind him of that. Thanks. 
 I heard from Andrew regarding the status of a business continuity plan. Attached is a short presentation that he sent me that I thought you would like to see.  Any interest in meeting with Andrew to get more detail?  I plan to get with him.  Let me know and I will be glad to set something up.

 Just wanted to let you know where we will be over the next week.  I am still at the office hoping to get away before dinner so that I can head home and pack.

 As mentioned, I will be out on vacation next week.  This contact list should be helpful if you need anything while I am out.  --Sally 
 Lunch on August 2nd works well for me.  I have it on the calendar.  I am planning a cook-out at my house on Sunday, July 30th for Enron summer interns from OU and recent hires from OU.  Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join us.  If you are in Houston, I hope that you will be able to join us too. Probably around 5:00 PM -- invitations should go out in the next few days with specifics.  Wanted to get the date on your calendar, however.  Let me know if you will be in town.  --Sally 
 This looks good.  Please send this wherever it should go.  Thanks.

 Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.  I should have had these for you on Tuesday for your PRC.  Hopefully, better late than never.  I am not certain how the coporate-wide PRC process will work in late July for VP's.  I have provided a copy of this to Dave Delainey for the ENA PRC which will take place on July 7.  I thought that I would provide you a copy as well.  I will also have Patti deliver a hard copy to Sharron next week. 
 Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.  I will also ask my assistant to deliver a hard copy to you on Wednesday, July 5.  Let me know if you have any questions or need more information.   Thanks. 
 Thanks for including me.  Unfortunately, I will be out of town at an offsite meeting with the ENA management team from December 13 - 16.  --Sally 
 End of July should be fine.  I am planning to be out July 26, 27 and 28, taking our 16 year-old on a tour of some college campuses before she starts her junior year.  Motivational, I hope!  --Sally 
 Welcome to Enron.  I'm glad that you made the decision to come here. Hopefully, that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of time!  Look for Kristin Albrecht and Leslie Reeves in power on 31.  They know more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor.  They both report to me.  Kristin heads risk management and Leslie leads operations. They can help you on any details about our power business.  My office is on the 30th floor - EB3015.  Stop by if you get the chance.  I will be moving to the 33rd floor during the week of July, actually while I am on vacation.  Have a great long weekend.  --Sally 
 Esther,  Thanks for forwarding documents for Sally.  She is also interested in Chicago - are there Chicago documents you can also forward to her?  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to schedule a photographer.  I will be in the office next week, Wednesday through Friday.  Then I will be on vacation the week of July 10th.  Let me know when the photographer will come, so that I will know what to wear! Thanks, and have a great long weekend.  --Sally 
 Esther,  Sally would like to view these documents now - is this on an "S" drive?  If so, how does she access.  Patti x39106

 Attached is Bob Superty's summary of the impact on the late noms today.  We do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type is "Intraday", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms were late.  Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today. Let me know if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 There are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from OU that I will invite to the cookout at my house on Sunday, July 30th.  I asked Jody's opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest, and his answer was yes.  So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest.  I thought that I would also include Lexi Elliott, the recruiter from the Analyst Program that will be covering OU.  Have you decided on the make-up of the recruiting team at OU in the fall?  If so, this might be a good event in which to include them as well.  I left you a voice mail message about James Scribner as a potential good member of the team.  Let me know your thoughts and I can include anyone else that you would like.  I plan to get invitations out to everyone by July 7. 
 Since receiving your e:mail message last Monday on your needs in power, I have spent three (!!!) full days in PRC meetings since then.  I have shared your needs with both Todd Hall and Kristin Albrecht (my power business controller here in Houston) and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be of help.  Sorry that I keep missing your calls.  I will be meeting with Fernley, but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow. 
 It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week. 
 Bruce,  Just a reminder, this Wednesday (Dec 13) is the Associate PRC meeting in which Sally will be representing Cheryl Ingstad.  She really needs your input in order to properly represent Cheryl.  Please email information to her ASAP or call Sally with information Tuesday between 9:00 - 9:30 AM (3:00 - 3:30 PM London time).  Thanks for your assistance, Patti x39106 
 I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case. The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time. 
 Let's book Friday, July 21 for this lunch.  I will work on further details. Thanks, Sharron. 
 Thanks for the input.  It is just in time -- I attend Rick Causey's cross functional PRC for Directors and above tomorrow.  I think that we have lunch coming up on the calendar on July 6.  I look forward to catching up then.  --Sally 
 I would like to invite you as University of Oklahoma summer interns to join me for lunch on Friday, June 30.   I have made reservations for 11:45 am at Nino's on West Dallas.   I hope that you will be able to attend and can meet me in the Enron lobby at 11:30.  We will provide transporation to and from lunch.  Please call me at x35926 as soon as possible to let me know if you can attend.  Mike McConnell, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks, will join us for lunch.  Many of you may have met Mike, a fellow OU grad.  He will serve as the Executive Lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at OU.  Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch.  James Scribner, a Senior Director in ENA Energy Operations, recently joined Enron after seven plus years with a Fortune 500 company in Edmond, Oklahoma.  James will be helping us with our OU recruiting efforts.  Lexi Elliott, a new recruiter with Enron's Associates and Analysts Program, will be coordinating Enron's recruiting efforts in the future at OU. 
 Thanks for the update.  I want to send her some flowers at the house.  Can you let Patti know if she is headed home on Friday?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 FYI - This came as a surprise to me.  Didn't know whether or not you knew about GInger's departure.  --Sally 
 UGH!!  I am happy for you, but know that Enron will be losing as you leave. I am pleased that the opportunity at Reliant is an exciting one for you, and I know that you will do a great job.  It has been fun to work with you, Ginger, and I too will miss that.  Best of luck to you!  --Sally 
 I know that Amanda will enjoy seeing you next week.  Thanks for making some time for her.  Let's definitely schedule a return trip for the two of you with some golf/cart time! 
 Looks as if this date will work for Mike McConnell and his wife, too.  I thought that I might also invite Ted Jacobs if he plans to be in  Houston that weekend.  Do you have an e:mail address for him?  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the response.  I will look for your list so that I can send out invitations.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away from the desk is not very workable either.  After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery. Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this decision?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions. Our meeting will take place on December 8th, so we can be ready to discuss promotion recommendations as early as Monday, December 11.  When would be a good time for you?  The invitation to attend our December 8th meeting still stands.  I know that it is along way to come for a single meeting (although it will most likely be a fully day), but if there are other things that you could accomplish while here, it could be worth it.  --Sally 
 Enjoy the time off!  Just let us know when that week comes who your in charge person will be.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for the offer.  I will take you up on it.  Can you get a list of recent OU grads hired at Enron?  I have the list of summer interns from OU. I thought that I would invite both full time and summer interns to the cookout.  I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.  How does that date work for you?  I assume that summer interns will still be with us then.  What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?  David will of course be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for them.  We can make this work either way.   Do you think that people would prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.  I will take your suggestion on this one.  After you get me the list of OU full timers, I will combine it with the list that I have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete.  Thanks for the help.  --Sally 
 Bob is a good, solid player.  He won't change the world, but he is diligent about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with Brent.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 06/13/2000 03:47 PM 
 I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill.  Thanks in advance to your attention to this. 
 They all made me laugh out loud.  I am glad that they all were able to get up!  Thanks. 
 I am not close enough to know Bob's exact role within the group to know the impact of the prospect of losing him.  I am forwarding this to Brent to get his assessment of the impact.  I do know that the number of deals that we do currently has skyrocketed with EOL, so I feel sure that the group is stretched right now.  Again, though, Brent would best be able to address this.  As you are probably aware, I personnally made the commitment to Bob several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as needed at home for his wife.  For Bob's sake, I would want to make sure that he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated.  Thank you for contacting me first before going to Bob.  --Sally 
 Our mid year PRC meeting will be held Monday, June 19, at the Doubletree's Grainger "B" room.   Please plan to be there to start the meeting at 8:00 AM, with a continental breakfast available starting at 7:30.  We will take the time necessary to do a good job, but will also try to be time efficient. Patti has lunch and snacks ordered, so I would hope to be finished sometime in the afternoon.  I am broadening the Energy Operations PRC committee beyond my direct reports to also include all directors in the organization.  I look forward to everyone's participation and will be sending out more information later.  Included below are the attendees for the meeting.    PRC Attendees Energy Operations	HR 	Outside Kristin Albrecht	Sheila Walton	Wes Colwell - Business Analysis & Reporting Scott Earnest	Norma Villarreal	David Oxley - Human Resources Sheila Glover	Hector McLoughlin	Jim Bouillion - Global Risk Markets (Insurance) Todd Hall	Toni Graham	Brad Blesie - Global Risk Markets (Origination) Susan Harrison	Janet De La Paz (to run computer) Peggy Hedstrom Brenda Herod Steve Jackson Scott Mills Mike Moscoso Eugenio Perez Brent Price Leslie Reeves Stephen Schwarz James Scribner Mary Solmonson Bob Superty Sheri Thomas Steve Venturatos 
 This reporting tool looks very useful.  I am glad to know that you are managing with this on a regular basis.  Do we have a well-defined follow-up process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?  This is a great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.  It would be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this. Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are doing confirmations?  I would include Global Products as well.  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office after noon on Friday, June 9, headed to the hill country to pick up one of my daughters from camp.  I will not attend the Friday afternoon meeting.  You will be able to reach me on my cell phone, 713-417-1591, as needed during the afternoon. 
 Approved.  Please process.  Thanks, Sally Beck 
 I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they also have data in to Sally by Thursday.  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Hi, Mike.  It is almost 2 pm Houston time as I am reading your message, so my hope is that you have already headed home today.  I would love to visit with you.  Would it work for us to talk at 9 am (3 pm London time) on Friday? Another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office.  I would expect to be in my car from about 7:00 to 8:00 am (Houston time) tomorrow.  My car phone number is 713-417-1591.  A few weeks ago I put together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to Houston.  Once you have scheduled a trip, my offer still stands to set up these meetings for you.  It may be easier for my assistant to coordate these things in Houston than for you assistant to attempt that from London, given the time difference.  I will look forward to speaking with you.  I understand that your value in the office is already felt.  --Sally 
 Buried with Shankman today.  I will e:mail you tomorrow. 
 Thanks for the info on your trip.  Have a great time -- I will be anxious to hear about the presentation in Natchez.  Love, Sally 
 I meant to send this to you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for confirming Mark's participation.  Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, will be sending information to your attention on the following:  Specifics on location of meeting at Rice Hotel Attendee list (names, titles, operating companies) Brief background on Mary Solmonson's Global Database Management Group Suggested  talking points for Mark's talk Agenda for the meeting  We will be sure to get this informaiton to you by Friday of this week, so that you can provide Mark with a copy when he is in the London office on Monday.  Thanks for your help--Sally 
 We will look forward to seeing you on the 17th.  Glad we could work out a date. 
 I left a voice mail message for Dave Delainey this morning asking for clarification around the LNG business.  As soon as I hear back from him I will let you know, and then based on that info we can decide on best next steps. 
 I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in Energy Operations.  Analysts  Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams  Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add more  strength to this group  Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to a trading  role, if appropriate   Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work experience and fit)  Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a direct hire  Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience   Associates  Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group  Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from Energy Operations interviewed him or her)  Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations   Let me know about next steps in this process.  I would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth. 
 I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis.  Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as well. 
 Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business. (This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with Jeff on this? 
 I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.  Kristin certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half of the year.  I would like to see her develop a broader view across the organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.  I guess that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 06:21 PM 
 We willl consider that a rain check.  Just let know in a cooler month when you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to play.  Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in Calgary the last time.  If you have a few minutes amidst the SAP training while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from your perspective how your interactions with my Houston operations group are going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement.  Just give me a call at x35926.  --Sally 
 We have lunch scheduled for June 22, according to my calendar.  I am looking forward to it.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.  I had put her on the list of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has been as involved with EOL.  --Sally 
 I didn't know about this one.  I'm going to follow up with Brent on this one and I will get back to you in a day or so.  We'll save the Scott Mills discussion for a later date!  On another note, I enjoyed lunch today.  Let me know when you want to get out of the building again sometime.  --Sally 
 My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project, Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity. 
 Please pring attached presentation for me in color.  Thanks. 
 I did walk out of the room with the two booklets (employee profiles and pre-review rankings) that had been distributed, and I left a message with Sheila Knudsen as soon as I got back to my office on Wednesday night to let her know.  They were delivered to Sheila on Thursday morning.  Can you verify that Sheila received those from me?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.  I apologize if I seemed impatient in the meeting.  I know that you are working for the best interests of Energy Operations and  Enron.  By the end of the day I was probably looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend itself well to that.  Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to talk separate from immediate issues at hand?  I will have Patti get a date on the calendar.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have entered the following names into the Performance Review System as suggested reviewers:  Commercial Customers  Jeff Shankman Jim Fallon Gary Hickerson   Direct Reports  Brent Price (Business Controller -Natural Gas) Kristin Albrecht (Business Controller - Power) Todd Hall (Business Controller - Merchant Portfolio)   Others  Rick Causey Ted Murphy Fernley Dyson (London) 
 Happy anniversary!  I hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call you to wish you that over the phone on my way home.  Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a total for gifts for both girls.  Love, Sally 
 I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time. Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally 
 Scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is in the London office now is Brent Price.  I looked up Scott's name on our Enron People Finder, and it would appear that he is in the IT department.  I assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the UK, so I would suggest that you contact Beth Perlman in Houston who leads IT for ENA or talk with Mark Pickering in IT in London.  My role in Houston is over the trading operations groups, but does not include IT.  I wish that I could answer your specific question for you, but I think that referring you to IT will get you the answer that you need. 
 Ditto. 
 I assume that granting access for someone for whom Lorraine Becker is the supervisor should be approved by you.  I get hundreds of these, many for employees outside Energy Operations.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Please print for me on legal size paper.  Thanks. 
 Per my voice mail...somehow my intent to copy you on this didn't work. Shona's extension is 39123 and she is sitting on the 30th floor.  --Sally 
 I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be good for to consider hiring.  Here is her response.  Tony Vasut had called her and asked for this list as well.  Do you have him keyed in on our blitz effort for hiring of risk personnel?  Or is he working on some other initiative?  I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.  --Sally 
 FYI - I believe that Shona will prove to be a great asset to Enron.  We are following up on her leads for talent.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the new role.  I think that it will be an interesting challenge and that you will do a great job.  How soon do you start?  --Sally 
 I have signed up for June 1st.  There is no indication on the e:mail that you forwarded of the location for the focus group.  I assume that more details will follow. 
 I will be attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting on December 7th.  It starts at 8:00 and may not take the entire day.  I will talk with Wes and see what he anticipates for timing to let you know if it makes sense to schedule me to interview.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have this on my calendar for September 7 and I am looking forward to it. Thanks. 
 Hi Ted,  It's Patti.  An all day meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 31 - the day you and Sally were scheduled for lunch.  Any possibility of rescheduling to another day?  Sally is available Thursday, June 1.  Just let me know.  Thanks, Patti 
 My new employee who will be working with me on global standards for operations for all trading/origination locations started with Enron yesterday.  Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.  She was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30 to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is one.   I will have her contact you later today.  Although she is new to Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the US and in Europe.  She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.   --Sally 
 I will be out of the office for one vacation day on Monday, May 22.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, has home and cell phone numbers where I can be reached throughout the day, if needed.  Primary operations contacts while I am out are as follows:  DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960  Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962  Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, May 23. 
 According to records from the Analysts Program, the following interns will be working within Energy Operations during the summer.  The assignment stated below is as reflected in the program's spreadsheet.  Name   School   Start Date Assignment  Luna Carlson  University of Florida  July 5  ENA - Risk Reporting and Analysis  Joshua Koenig  University of Florida  May 22  Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management  Jolly Jose  University of Houston  June 5   Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management  Michael Taylor  LSU    May 22  Central Desk Logistics  Daniel Graham  Morehouse   May 15  ENA - Financial Settlements  Angelique Woods University of Texas  May 22  ENA - Risk Management    First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made for desk, phone and computers for all.  Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to Enron.  Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you. 
 FYI  -- Let me know who Angelic will report to and what she will be doing. Thanks. 
 Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally 
 I agree that discussing the numbers in person with AA would be the right way to handle this.  And, I am looking to Brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting.  My expectation is that the vast majority of the $49MM variance will be explained and finalized by Monday at 11:00 am.  This finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.  I will be on vacation on Monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but I have carved out time during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation, as it is very important to me.  --Sally 
 Mary,  Sally says this is okay.  Patti 
 Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday.  I am glad that you are eager to get together to kick off your role -- we will have to save that for Tuesday, however.  I am taking the day off on Monday to be with my parents who will be in from Austin for one of my daughter's piano recital.  9:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday would be a great time for us to get together.  There are two other meetings that day that I would like to have you attend with me.  One is a weekly Risk Forum luncheon from 11:30 to 1:00 and the other is a meeting at 3:00 on trading operations for Tokyo.  I will give the details on location and list of attendees when you and I meet on Tuesday morning.  Enjoy your next few days.  I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday. Check with my assistant, Patti Thompson, on where you will be sitting.   I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  --Sally 
 Tara,  Sally says Todd's London project is under Barry Pearce (related to Continental Power) - Barry would need to designate London RC (or James New in his absence, since Barry is in Houston).  Regarding the "extra" housing costs, this would need to be charged to Todd's RC in Houston, which is #2182.  Please let me know if you require additional information.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Approved.  Please process. Sally Beck 
 Thanks for the update and attachment.  It will be great to have you back here in Houston.  I have heard lots of good things about your assignment there, however, so I know that the London group will miss your presence.  I will try to call you Wednesday morning on my way into the office.  I. 
 Sally has changed the time of her Thursday morning meeting to 8:30 - 10:30 AM (previously scheduled 8:00 - 10:00 AM).  Please let me know if you can't make this new time.  Topic for meeting:  information from her ENA Executive Offsite and also a brainstorming session.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Thanks for the reminders.  Hopefully, this will take care of this. 
 Irena,  Can you attach file?  Patti    Enron North America Corp. 
 Mary,  As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison as a signer.  Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume Management groups.  This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.  Thanks, Sally 
 Ted,  I checked with Sally and she says Wednesday, May 31 is good for lunch & she looks forward to seeing you.  Patti 
 Fernley,  Sally asked me to forward this to you to outline what she is doing with Arthur Anderson to get ready for SAP, specifically, Global Products.  Patti 
 Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management operations initiatives.  I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary to get your input on his role to date. 
 I have been summoned for jury duty onTuesday, November 28 at 8:00 am.  While wanting to fulfill my civic duty, I am also hoping to be an unlikely juror this time around so that I can be back in the office sometime on Tuesday.  I will call in and let Patti know my status. 
 Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA.  I didn't realize that when I said hello in the elevator last week that we would be seeing more of you in Houston.  I look forward to working with you when you arrive. 
 Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer.    Your leadership in ENA was appreciated and I will miss your active participation in ENA's business.  However, I hope that we will have opportunities to work together in the future.  --Sally 
 This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource.   Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.  Let me know how I can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined.  I was impressed with my brief glimpse of Jeff at yesterday's 5:30 meeting.  --Sally 
 Well done!  Beth will be a great resource.  --Sally 
 I will be in the Calgary office from Wednesday afternoon, May 10 through noon on Friday, May 12.  I can most easily be reached through Peggy Hedstrom, whose phone via tie line is 820-6753.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, has a copy of my itinerary and phone and fax numbers at my hotel, if needed.  Primary operations contacts in Houston while I am in Calgary are as follows:  DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960  Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962  Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210 
 Laura,  I am attaching resume of Mark Mixon that Sally left you a voicemail regarding on Monday.  If you are going to be in town and would like to see Mark, please let me know and I would be happy to make arrangements.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 Sally's Assistant 
 I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear Julie Andrews speak.   Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as our daughters.  So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High School with Meagan.  Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.  I hope that all of you enjoy the evening.  The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next Tuesday, May 16.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot for dinner.   That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.  I can't think of a better idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, motivated women!     I will look forward to introducing her to those of you whom she has not yet met. 
 I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this afternoon.   I have left a message for Bryce and I will get with him on Tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message after that.  --Sally 
 Below is the name and phone number of the woman that I worked with to arrange our tour of Enron  Field.  She may not be the person to talk with regarding displaying a boat, but  will very likely be able to give the correct contact.  It was nice to meet you.  I have enjoyed getting to know Bethany through NCL.  Good luck!    Jill McCormick  713-259-8965 
 I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's name was "in play", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead. Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would like.  His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".  He and Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.  Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the heads up.  I get so many of these requests and never can tell what is being requested!  Your note made this one fast and easy to handle. Thanks. 
 Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates. 
 Please print the attachment for me in color.  Maybe three copies.  Thanks. 
 Stephen joined Enron on January 29, 1996.  Is there any other info that you need?  Are you still planning to be in Houston next week? --Sally 
 He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.  He reports to Scott Mills, who is the user lead for the project.  I am copying Scott on this message, as his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the horizon and how critical Tom's involvement is to those deliverables.  I suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions.  --Sally 
 You have the right earrings -- they are tiny!  But that's what she would like.  She will be really pleased.  She loves her silver ones, but they are not great for everyday wear -- gold is better for her ears.  Sounds as if your weekend was fun.  Ours was nice --errands and stuff on Saturday and the Enron picnic at Astroworld on Sunday.  Otherwise, just camping out in the mess at our house.  I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist. Sounds as if from her ER buddy at the Heart Hospital that she has decided that they need both -- one for counseling and one for meds.  I believe that she and Dad will each see a counselor type on Tuesday this week.  I hope that they will begin to find some relief.  Sounds as if they are really having a hard time - at least Mom.  We would still like for you to come visit.  Let's talk dates when you're ready.  --Sally 
 FYI - Let's talk.  I am already booked for Tuesday AM - could you attend and would you want to?  Let's talk before getting back to Margaret.  --Sally 
 FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally 
 I understand that Ashley Worthing has been hired by Enron to start work this summer.  I think that she is graduating from Texas A&M.  She is my cousin's daughter, so I am just curious whether or not she is coming in as an analyst.  Please let me know if that is the case.  Thanks. 
 I gave a copy of this document to Wes Colwell immediately following last week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you.  He is the most appropriate respondent from ENA.  --Sally 
 Did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail ?  There was not one attached. 
 She was Superior - top of the table.  Her written review should be in the file.  Let me know if HR can not produce that for you and I can get you a copy.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 12:46 PM 
 Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town. Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally 
 Glad you sent a note - as crazy as life is at our house right now, I did not get the message from Tammy.  Lots of catch up in the office last week, which will continue this week.  I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.  We are starting to talk birthday with Meagan now.  I will get back with you in a couple of days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.  Thanks for asking. --Sally 
 Hi Clare,  How about:  Tuesday, May 9th 1:30-2:30 PM or 3:00-4:00 PM  Sally has tentative plans to go to Calgary May 10-12, so Tuesday is best for her.  If neither of these time slots work, just let me know and I can move things around to accommodate James.  See ya, Patti 
 Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition:  Example:  Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that is clarified. 
 Barbara,  Will this be at 4:00 PM on Monday?  Sally has meeting w/ Louise Kitchen from 3:30 to 4:30, so she will probably be 30 mins late to Jeff's meeting.  Patti 
 It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure time.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.  I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.  My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like a very long ten day stay.  He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight! Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health for him going forward.  Thanks for asking.  --Sally 
 Tara,  When I tried to approve this request (Sheri gave verbal approval), I got message that it had already been approved by another access approver.  Patti x39106 
 Thanks for your note.  Between meetings today, I will construct a loose job description and e:mail that to you later today.  I realized after you left that we did not talk about compensation.  It would help me in creating this role with our HR group if I knew ballpark figures on compensation.  We have a good comp team that can research that for me, but a short cut would be to know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking for  in making a move.  Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail.  My number is 713-853-5926.  --Sally 
 I would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first Gas Ops program. Keep me posted on date and time.  Thanks for attending the meeting yesterday.  I hope that you will let me know when and how I can best be involved and provide support for your efforts.  --Sally 
 Here it is! 
 I have this on my calendar.  I have jury duty on Tuesday starting at 8:00 am.  I hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as I can.    So I should be able to make the meeting at 4:00.  I will call you if I get hung up at the court house.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 You have a ticket - we will see you there, with you pager on!  Patti will get your ticket to you before Thursday. 
 Do you want to give your tickets to someone in your group and join the management team?  Up to you...    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sounds interesting, and Scottsdale is supposed to be nice.  Enjoy! 
 Sounds like a good idea.  I am glad to Theresa is getting some benefit from the program.  --Sally 
 Sheila,  I'm sorry I haven't responded to this before, but Sally has been out of the office with family illness & I haven't been able to check with her.  I will be out of the office until Tuesday, so if you need this information before then, please call Chantelle Villanueva at ext.36279 on Monday and she can check with Sally then.  Thanks, Patti 
 Joe,  Sally is out of the office, but wanted me to forward the message that she had reviewed the draft that you put together regarding power trading and she doesn't have any comments.  Patti x-39106 
 Approved.  Sally Beck 
 Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.  I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following:  Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU  Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida  Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of Florida  Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU  Carolyn Barrett  EBS  Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P   Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus.  SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May.  Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or communication about the program.   We hear rumors of "tracks", but no facts or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some had not.  Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.  Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.   Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:  Disc 
 Kim,  Sally says that Wes Colwell will be assigning ENA representative.  Patti x39106 
 I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.  Below are my suggested seven appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.  I made the selections based on their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.  I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today.   Analyst  School  Current Rotation Rationale  Ilan Caplan  UT   CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations  Erin Rice  Trinity   CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the solution; female minority  Brian Hoskins  Vanderbilt  ENA Trading  I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one  Carrie Southard  Texas A&M  ENA - EOL  Current MSA rotation  Alejandro Veiga Rice   ESA - Venezula  Good ideas; diverse background  Courtney Votaw  Pepperdine  Corp. - PR  Adds interest to the mix with her rotation & background  Adrian Woolcock Rice   EES   Sounds mature; good ideas 
 Can you coordinate the Scott Tholen's team to do this ASAP?  Thanks.  Keep me updated on when Fernley will have access.  Thanks. 
 Approved. Sally Beck 
 I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.  However, in my staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for EOL access.  We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.  Susan needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager should  okay this as well.  --Sally 
 Please incorporate these changes into the 2000 plan.  Thanks. 
 We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all be glad to see you.  I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it. And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  Love, Sally 
 I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office. Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, however!  I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can easily step out to talk with you. 
 Please incorporate the management contact changes per Sheila Glover for the 2000 plan. 
 Approved. Sally Beck  System would not allow me to submit request electronically. 
 Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get together.  Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.  When that is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.  Hope your weekend was a good one.  Have you seen Brent yet?  --Sally 
 Willie Harrell Security Request approved. Sally Beck 
 Thanks for sending the announcement to me.  You will be a great asset to EBS.  And you will probably be working with some of our old Energy Operations staff members!  Stay in touch and I wish you the best in your new role. --Sally 
 Fall sounds good to me.  In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 The scholarships, while sponsored by Enron, are technically awarded by UT.  I will be talking with Sue White today, and I will get her take on whether or not the university wants to contact the winners or whether Enron should do it.  I will let you know.  The 24th is a great day for me for the dinner in Austin.  So if that works for recepients and faculty, then that would work our well.  Keep me posted. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have asked Patti to get us together  to discuss your e:mail message as soon as possible.  Hopefully, we can work that out this week.  I llok forward to talking with you and I will be glad to help you in any way that I can. 
 Energy Operations will enjoy participating in this program.  I would like to bring this us up at my staff meeting on Monday, April 10, so I will get back to you with the number of students and the contact person(s) next week. --Sally     Susan Skarness 03/31/2000 04:37 PM 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.  The field will make baseball much more fun in Houston. 
 I already have this date on my calendar.  Count me in.  --Sally 
 We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue. However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official notification from the University takes place.  Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she would like to be included if her schedule permits.  Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me know how I can help with these arrangements.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will look forward to meeting you during your visit to Houston next week.  I will work with Carol to schedule a time that will work for both of us.  Have a nice flight.  --Sally 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.   It was certainly a panoramic view from up there!  I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to Enron, and I am  certainly glad that you are here.

 Meant to copy you on this reply to Mike, but forgot to do so before my initial send.  Here it is... 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.  That was quite a climb to those seats!  I did it a couple of times with my two year old in arms, and wasn't sure that I would make it!  That's good that you could watch from a lower level. --Sally 
 Per my voice mail message, attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in London.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Fernley and I plan to send this out sometime next week, prior to Brent's assignment starting on April 10. 
 Do you know what this is?   ISO makes me think power.  Any clues?  --Sally 
 Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this season.  One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is two tickets in the terrace level.  I have also purchased one parking spot in a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.  I have divided the tickets among you, with my husband's help.  He identified "good games" (i.e. teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across my direct reports.  Tickets for the other games have been distributed based your percentage of Energy Operations employees.  For most games, you will receive all six tickets.  You can use these tickets for yourself and for a small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.  The parking information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.  Patti is including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.  Your tickets will be distributed to you this week.  I hope that you and your staff will enjoy these.  I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.  I have chosen to distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy Operations who are not my direct reports.  SInce you will have first call on the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.  I wanted to make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.  Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a weekday afternoon and one a weekend.  I will let you know these dates soon, as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games. 
 Approved.  Please note that Co. # should be 0342 for Misc. Expense on Todd032400LondonSAP expense report. Thanks, Sally Beck

 Sorry, I can;t help you on this one.  I don't have a copy.  --Sally 
 I will be at the meeting on Thursday.  I have asked Brenda Herod to attend as well.  Can you add her to your distribution list so that she receives notice of these meetings as well?  That way, one or both of us will be able to attend.  Thanks. 
 I will plan to attend.  Can you attend as well?  --Sally 
 Definitely take off and meet Scott at the airport.  I know that you will be glad to see him.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.    -Sally

 I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use this.  Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you. 
  Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies in which Enron holds an ownership interest.   Attached is a copy of that schedule.  Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.  You will note that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.  We have identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA. 
 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591). I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once or twice a day.  I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London around 1 AM Houston time).  I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27. 
 The e:mail system never recognizes Rick Causey, so you were dropped from the first distribution.  I have to remember to type your full first name! 
 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday this week (March 15-17).   I will be with my children while they are on Spring Break.  I can be reached those three day either at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).   The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the office while I am out: Key Operations Contacts March 15-17  Brent Price   Business Controller, Gas  x37647  Kristin Albrecht   Business Controller, Power  x34763  Also, I will be in the London office during the week of March 20th.  I am working with Fernley Dyson and John Sherriff to structure training and orientation for a new head of trading operations that has been hired in London.  I am also working to provide transition resources to London for operational controls unttil the new guy is on board.  My work on this should be completed by the end of next week.  I will return to Houston on Friday, March 24.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106),  will have a copy of my schedule while I am in London as well as an international mobile phone number where I can be reached. Please don't hesitate to call.  I will be responding to voice mail messages throughout the week.

 Per my earlier e:mail message, I am forwarding to you the draft of the report on the operations/controls review of Singapore.  (It is an attachment to the message from Scott Earnest to me.)  The most current drafts of the reports on Oslo and  Frankfurt were compiled by the AA team in London.  Nick Swingler is apparently out on vacation this week.  I have asked AA personnel from Houston to coordinate with their London office to get you a copy of those two draft reports.  Given the time difference, you should receive thos reports via e:mail from AA on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 I'll look forward to seeing you.  Since my first note, I have scheduled a dinner with Richard Sage on Thursday evening - the only time that he and I can meet, since he is in Helsinki through Wednesday, in the office on Thursday but booked that day.  With the Tuesday dinner with Fernley, that leaves Monday or Wednesday.  I hope that one of those days works for you and Frank.  I will try to call Mo - I think that she is still in Houston today. --Sally 
 1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive those drafts today.  2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am there.  3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are the following:  Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide for you during this transition period Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of the details on having support personnel in London  Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one (which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)  Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective trading operations and controls world-wide  I look forward to seeing you next week. 
 Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these meetings if you would like to do so.  The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible.  Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week. It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London. I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed.  I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids. The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April.  Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them. 
 I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to Houston next week.  My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it looks as if we will miss one another.  My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  I will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, with effective exception reporting.  This is a key initiative for 2000 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities. 
 I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next week and I had asked her to arrange  a lunch with you and Brent, plus some time for just the two of us to get together.  We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally 
 Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.  Wanted to see if you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.  We arrive on Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning. Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.  But Monday, Wednesday and Thursday are available.  Does it work for you with the baby to do evenings?  Let me know. 
 Have fun in San Antonio.   It is a very popular spring break destination. Enjoy it! 
 3PM sounds great.  I will look forward to meeting you. 
 We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations.  I view this as a business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.  ENA is picking up the cost associated with the family.  Sounds as if I need to make sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that handled.  That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those days., both evening games.  I would be happy to give you four tickets for either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 10th or the 12th.  We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying through Thursday, so we should see one another before April.  I am working on an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your homework on this.  We will definitely take a look at these two places next week while we are in London.  Let us know what we need to do to schedule this.  I look forward to meeting you.  One of your earlier messages suggested meeting on Monday morning.  Monday is great, but we would have to make that an afternoon meeting.  Brent and I will be on the flight that leaves Houston at 7:00 PM on Sunday evening, arriving at Gatwick around 10:00 AM.  By the time we clear customs, take the train, check in to the hotel and shower, we will not be in the office before 12:30 or 1:00.  Do you have a time available to meet with us that afternoon?   Thanks.  --Sally 
 Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might interest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate. If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral along to other HR groups.  FYI - James will start work here on April 3.

 The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott Tholen's team to my operations team.   (This makes a lot of sense, since it is our group that prepares all of these reports.)  Fernley Dyson has requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.  In insuring a tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access to the Enron-wide DPR.  Thanks. 
 FYI - This should make things easier in London as there will be one point person to focus on global.  I am not sure that her background will bring a lot to the table in the early stages, but she did seem sharp when I met with her last week.  This announcement did surprise me a bit, as when I last talked with Fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing Tani in this role.  ---Sally 
 Kevin Sweeney forwarded this message to me.  Fernley may have made you aware of his decision with Tani when you and he talked yesterday.  If not, I thought that you might be interested in this.  --Sally

 Approved. Sally Beck 
 Am just back from Disneyworld (Tyler loved it, so you will have a great time in a few weeks) today, and I did get your message.  I will talk with Kristin this afternoon.  I agree that Edith would be great.  I will let you know if there is someone else that we can make available if Edith doesn't work.  I will leave you a message tonight before I go on status.  --Sally 
 Please print 3 copies for me in color.  Thanks. 
 I would definitely talk with Wes Colwell about doing the presentation on Business Analysis & Reporting.  I think that he would do a great job!

I do not plan on checking messages, so if something critical comes up, please leave me a message at the hotel.  We are there with the Klein High School Bearkadettes, in case you need to know that to get a message to me. 
 Thanks for making the arrangements in Boerne!  It's interesting to know that the mustard men are real and not just a made up story for tourists. I am glad that I avoided them! 
 Is this what you have from AA as a format/information that they are comfortable with?  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office on vacation on Thursday, Friday and Monday, March 2, 3, and 6th.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) will have telephone and fax numbers for the hotel where I will be staying.  I will be at Disneyworld with my family and 90 members of my daughter's high school drill team, so it is not likely that I will be available during the daytime.  However, I can be contacted at the hotel in the evening, if needed.  While I am out, please contact the following for any operational needs:  Brent Price   Business Controller for Natural Gas  x37647  Kristin Albrecht *   Business Controller for Power   x34763   *  Kristin will be in the office in the morning only on March 6: she will be in route to Portland in the afternoon.   I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 7. 
 Rick:  Sorry, I should have sent this to you several days ago.  Is the level of detail correct on these goals as you look to assimilate these with others?  I have stated the goals, but not the action plan to achieve the goals.  I am working on those in some detail right now.   --Sally      Goals for 2000 Global Risk Management Operations   I.  Build/Enhance Operational and Controls Infrastructure to Support:  A.  Merchant Activities  Japan Southern Cone Continental Europe Other regions as identified  B.  Emerging Businesses/Products  Enron Broadband Services Credit Trading Other products as identified  C.  Joint Ventures   II.  Strengthen Mid and Back Office Talent and Controls for Global Risk Management Operations  A.  Establish common operational standards,with effective exception reporting  B.   Strengthen and support the controls mindset in key operational personnel  C.  Develop a plan to identify, develop and provide rotational opportunities to key operations employees  D.  Continue to coordinate with IT to develop mid and back office systems that allow for timely and accurate compilation of data across  systems for risk and business reporting 
 Was it not January when we were back and forth and back and forth to London/Helsinki?  And despite the fact that the date sequence from London looks funny, it would seem that Nigel on the 17th of February is talking about beginning the process (actually debating the process) of background checks? 
 With my recent travel, I am days (maybe weeks) behind on e:mail.  I didn't see my name on the attachment.  Do I have access to this? 
 Please print a color copy for me of the two attachments to Kate's memo. Thanks. 
 Ted Murphy and I met with the Arther Andersen team this morning that accompanied us on our trip to Buenos Aires.  We reviewed the observations and recommendations in written form that we had discussed briefly with you on our last day your office.  After making a few changes, AA should be forwarding to you a copy of the draft document later this afternoon.   We would welcome your comments and your additions on anything that you think we may have missed.  Ted and I will be meeting with Rick Causey and Rick Buy within the next couple of days to discuss our operations and control review, so your responses would be welcomed prior to that meeting.  I look forward to working with you and others in your office in my role over Global Risk Management Operations.  In addition to overseeing common standards and controls for opeartional practices, I will work as your advocate for system and resource needs in order to insure success for your business plan in Buenos Aires. 
 Ted Murphy and I met this morning with the Arthur Andersen team that accompanied us to Sao Paulo.  We reviewed a summary of our observations and recommendations as a result of our visit.  After a few suggested changes, AA should forward a copy of this draft to you via e:mail later today.  We would welcome your comments on the document, and input on anything that you think we may have missed.  Ted and I will be reviewing this information with Rick Buy and Rick Causey as soon as a meeting can be scheduled, so your prompt comments or feedback would be welcomed. 
 My travel lately has not allowed time to interview.  Gretchen Jennings in HR is supposed to be setting up interviews with appropriate candidates for me. She has a stack of all of the resumes that either I have received or those that responded to the posting.  I hope to start interviewing next week, although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday.  Feel free to move forward with whatever you need to do.  I trust that I will have several good candidates to consider, and Patti is doing a great job, also.  I need to find out if she would like to  be considered for the fulltime position. 
 Thanks for this info.  I will call the students this week.  With your notes, it looks as if we may be on target in terms of acceptances and the desired number of 6.  Keep me posted on what we hear from the students.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Peggy Hedstrom will be out of the office from March 1 - 11 for vacation. Our spring break week is March 13, so I have sent Peggy a note asking about sometime the week of March 20 or 27.  I will let you know her reply and then I would love to do a joint trip! 
 I have not been able to schedule a review with Peggy yet, as I am still trying to schedule a trip to Calgary so that Peggy and I can do her review. She will be out of town from March 1 through March 11, so I will have to come to Calgary sometime after March 11.  I was in South America last week, and have been to London and Helsinki twice since mid-January, so scheduling reviews is a challenge this time around.  I will certainly get you a signed copy of the review as soon as I can. 
 Clare,  Barry left me voicemail saying 1:30-2:30 pm would probably be okay - I will tentatively put that in Sally's calendar.  We can change later if need be.  Thanks, Patti 
 Barry, Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.  A lot of people will be tied up all day Feb 29 at this offsite.  She would, however, like to set up time to meet with you in Houston on Wednesday, March 1.  Sally is available from 1:30 - 5:00 in the afternoon.  Please let me know if there is a one hour slot that will work for you.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 (Sally's Assistant) 
 Ted,  Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.  Patti 
 Another FAS 133 Offsite meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, Feb 29 (all day).  Sally asked me to forward this to you - would like you to attend if at all possible.  Scott, this is an FYI for you - I know you will be overseas on this date.  Patti 
 Sally asked me to forward this to you.  Patti 
 Paige,  Sheila Glover and Scott Earnest will be attending for Sally.  Mike Moscoso is out of town.  Patti 
 Mike & Scott,  Sally asked me to forward this to you & wanted to know if there was any way possible you could attend. I apologize for the short notice, but with Sally going out of the country, things have been really hectic.   Sheila Glover will also be attending.  Please let me know as soon as possible & I will let Paige know.  Thanks, Patti x 39106 
 Kent,  Please forward this to Sally Beck.  Thanks, Patti 
 Thanks for the resume.  She has had some good experience.  Do you know much about her performance here at Enron?  Can I call and talk with her directly? I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point.  --Sally 
 I have asked Patti to send Sharron a list of all employees within Energy Operations (a BIG list) and another one with managers and above (perhaps a more manageable list) for this effort.  Since you went to the meeting I didn't know whether or not you were following up on this.  Just wanted to let you know that I have asked Patti to do this.  Thanks. 
 I think that this was great, too.  I look forward to the next one.  Would you like to coordinate dinner plans for the next lecture? 
 Approved.  Please process. Thanks, Sally Beck 
 FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having their names included twice in promotional memos!  Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary. 
 I won't be able to join Wanda and Juanita in Calgary next week.  I will find myself in South America next week, in Sao Paolo and Buenos Aires.  Should be interesting, but a long flight.  I am cross referencing my calendar with your vacation days, and I will get back with you later today on a suggested date for a trip north. 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is very well deserved.  I follow your career within Enron with interest. 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director.  That makes all of the life juggling seem a little more worthwhile, doesn't it?! 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is very well deserved.  You do an amazing job of balancing children and work, and contributing so much on your work on 133. 
 Please print a color copy of this for me.  Thanks. 
 Friday at 2:00 pm  --does that work for you?  --Sally 
 How about our resources?   Is there someone working on Entelligence now for us that could at least temporarily be redirected to work on updating GCP appropriately? 
 Thanks  -- definitely not too late.  --Sally 
 Thanks for keeping me posted on this.  Do let me know if there are further problems. 
 Friday won't work for me for lunch this week, but Thursday is open for me at this point.  Would that day work for you?  If lunch won't work, then we will plan some time on the calendar for Thursday or Friday.  Let me know.   I will look forward to seeing you. 
 The draft of the memo looks good.  However, your memo says that the memo will be sent to all US employees of ENA.  ENA by definition includes Canada and Mexico.  Therefore, please send the memo to all ENA employees, not just those in the US.  Several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in our Calgary office, so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees in Calgary.  I am at x35926 if you have any questions. 
 Please distribute attached memo to all Enron North America employees.  If you need additional information, please call my assistant, Patti Thompson at ext. 39106.  Thank you, Sally Beck Vice President of Energy Operations 
 This made it!  We are still waiting today to find out if we can get a Visa today.  If so, I will be on the way to South America on Sunday evening.  If Chris' associate has any recommendations, I would love to hear them. Thanks.  --Sally 
 It does work!  We enjoyed seeing you, also.  Thanks for letting us crash temporarily at your house. 
 Brent & Peggy,  Memo complete with exception of last paragraph write-up of your promotions. Sally made a beginning stab at it, but would like you to read over your segment and make any corrections or additions that you see fit (Peggy, in your case, can you fill in the blank).  When these are received back from you, I will call her (if it's this afternoon), and final copy will be distributed.  Thanks for your help.  Patti x39106 
 Approved.  Please process. Thanks, Sally Beck 
 The attachment on Ted's memo contains the list of students who will attend the luncheon tomorrow.  Thanks again for doing this! --Sally 
 I will be attending a funeral in Austin on Thursday.  I can be reached on my cell phone (713-417-1951) in the morning and afternoon while driving to and from Austin.  If you need immediate information and I can not be reached on my cell phone, please contact Brent Price at x37647.  I will be back in the office on Friday. 
 I will be out of the office on Tuesday, so have a great time without me. Have a great Thanksgiving. --Sally 
 FYI...Thanks for going.  --Sally 
 Approved.  Please process.  Thanks. Sally Beck 
 David, Can you resend 1/26/00 MPR?  I mistakingly deleted file before all worksheets were printed.  Thanks, Patti (Sally's assistant) 
 Please join us for a celebration of Energy Operations promotions, hosted by ENA Energy Operations Management Team.  The following people will be honored at Irma's (22 N. Chenevert @ Franklin) on Thursday, February 3, 2000 from 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm.  Brent Price  Kristin Albrecht   Brenda Herod Leslie Reeves  Mary Solmonson  Scott Pleus Sheri Thomas  Bennett Kaufman  Richard McKeel John Postlewaite Sylvia Campos   Kam Keiser Phillip Love  Anthony Campos  Kori Loibl Trang Le  Donnie Vinson   Imelda Frayre Amy Degeyter  Michael Nguyen  Sherlyn Schumack Karie Hastings  Leslie Smith  Please RSVP by Friday, January 31 to Patti at ext. 39106 or e-mail reply.

 I can not attend as I will be in the London office for the remainder of the week.  Hope that all is well with you.  We will have to catch up soon. 
 Please forward to James Scribner.  He will call with his e:mail address. = =20 
 Thanks for your note!  --Sally 
 Thanks for forwarding mail to me.  I apologize for the inconvenience of this.  My current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com, as suggested within the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long name.   HOWEVER, my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com. That was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation I am sure.  When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.  So I can see why you would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated guess on the address or referencing my old card.  SInce there are at least 2 sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between us?   That might help eliminate confusion going forward. 
 Thanks for the note.  While most of my focus will be on ENA, it will be interesting to look at operations around the world. 
 Please find out location of this conference call and put the details on my calendar.  Thanks. -- Sally 
 I am out of the office all day on Wednesday. --Sally 
 Please put my name on the list to attend this forum on Wednesday, January 26.  Thanks. 
 Thanks-- I think! 
 I always have time for lunch!  I will ask my assistant to call you to set something up.  Thanks for your note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the note.  I am glad that you are enjoying Portland.  I am still on the 30th floor, so do drop by sometime when you are in town.  I would love to see you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the note.  I hope that you are enjoying your role in EES. 
 Thanks -- I now know that you read notes mail messages very promptly! --Sally 
 Thanks for the note, Sherri.  I know that you read notes mail messages very promptly!  --Sally 
 Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.  This memo will be sent by Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the organization. 
 It is officially on the way!  We will see how long it takes to get=20 distributed.  --Sally=20 
 I liked the new signs for the new hire network this morning, as opposed to the signs for new hire orientation.  Just wanted to let you know that I noticed the difference!  I will be curious to hear about changes to the content as well.  Hope your are doing well.  We will have to have lunch after you get through January!  --Sally 
 Could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as Hess?  You will have to explain to me what the issue was.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 This is the most immediate response that I have ever gotten on notes mail! Just let me know and I will be there.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the note about the video conference.  I have put that date on my calendar and I am very interested in the discussion.  Any details on where I need to go in Houston to join in?  --Sally 
 Please take these meetings off my calendar.  Thanks! 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is wonderful to see your contributions recognized in that way!  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your new role in the communciations company.  Building that business will be exciting and how great for the company that you will be there! 
 Attached is a memo that Rick plans to send out - I hope that attaching this makes it easy for you to take care of this.  I am delivering to him a highlighted copy of the memo so that he will know about a few wording changes that I have made since the last time that he saw this in draft form.  He is certainly free to make any other changes before it goes out.  Call me with any questions. 
 John and I haven't talked about this need, but I will certainly think about any likely candidates.  Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & Documentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.  He was knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book administrator in a previous life.  Have you considered him?  Give me a couple of days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get back with you.  --Sally 
 This includes OU and UT -- you can ignore the OU names, but there are some good students that I can introduce you to when they arrive! 
 Cecilia, pls forward attachment. Thx. 
 I believe that we may have a potentially good fit for Avril, but my direct report who would have to add her to his staff is on vacationing out of town until Monday.  I will talk with him on Monday morning and I will have him visit with Jeff Sorenson, who previously interviewed Avril (he liked her and was favorably impressed, but had no position for her).  We may then want to be able to talk with Avril by phone, since a face-to-face interview will not be possible.  We should have a decision then very early in the week.  Since you will be in Houston I can update you in person.  I would not panic! 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow and I have asked Mary Solmonson to attend in my place.  Have a great Thanksgiving! --Sally    Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 Preview of info request before targeted 4:30 PM meeting in my office today. 
 The industry quote below is interesting.  I have a call in to Bob to ask him to get you key measurements on EOL business to date.  --Sally 
 Please  update my listing for direct reports.  Do you distribute a copy of this to my direct reports?  If so, please get an updated copy to them as well.  Thanks! 
 THE ATTACHED IS THE CORRECT VERSION.  Please disregard an earlier version of this form sent to Chris Shenkman by Dawn Doucet.  That version was not complete. 
 Attached please find a completed employee profile for Brent Price for consideration for promotion to Vice President.  Please call me if you have any questions. 
 The address list on the memo below contains the names of all ENA Energy Operations employees who worked in the offices in Houston, Denver and Calgary on January 1st to test our systems.   Does it work for you to copy and paste this for Cliff's note?  Let me know if it would be better to provide this to you in a different way.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for being so prompt. 
 These dates look fine -- I hope that you have something fun planned!  The only slight glitch is that I will receive the bonus sheets on Monday, January 10 and that our turn around time is one day.  If it is convenient for you we can talk by phone on Monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can plan on meeting first thing on Tuesday, the 11th.  I do not yet know at what time on Tuesday we will have to have final changes made.  --Sally 
 Thanks for keeping me posted on the PRC meeting.  I will make travel plans for the afternoon of December 13th accordingly.  --Sally 
 Reference for future months. 
 Does the info as provided from HR indicate MBA's from UT?  I know that Enron probably has a number of undergrads from UT.  At this point, I am specifically interested in UT MBA's, as it is the Houston Chapter of UT's Graduate Business Network for which I will now serve on the steering committee.  Thanks!  --Sally 
 1) Y2K Team:  Let me know if you would like to send a notes mail message from you to the individuals that were here on Saturday, January 1 for the Y2K testing.  I have created an address list that contains those names that I could forward to Susan Skarness to use for that purpose.  2) Draft Memo from Rick Causey:  Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey proposes to send this week that describes a coordination role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be coordinated in all trading locations.   I have left you some comments regarding this on my voice mail.  I would welcome your comments or questions. 
 Is there one for this week? Pls. let me know.  Thx. 
 I am resending the original message that I sent to Kevin regarding Rick Causey's memo.  Please refer him to the second point in my e:mail, as well as the attachment.  Thanks. 
 We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have we.  Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at home.  See you soon. 
 I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as usual.  I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to all that we will accomplish in 2000. 
 I know that over the past few weeks you have been handling your daily responsibilities and working on the transition of business from our aquisition of CES's wholesale business.  I realize that balancing all of this has been demanding, especially with the holidays, bid week and other end of year actitivies.  Thank you for the extra effort that you have given to effectively absorb the CES book of business.  It is noticed and appreciated.  As we look forward to the new year, I thank you for your accomplishments and contributions in 1999.  It was a challenging and rewarding year for ENA and Energy Operations.  I hope that each one of you enjoys the New Year's celebration.  I look forward to all that will be accomplished by working together in 2000. 
 FYI -- As a result of a discussion that I had earlier in the week with Georgeanne... 
 Approved.  Pls. process.  Thx.  Sally Beck 
 Thanks for the note.  The family is doing well -- keeping us busy with a=20 teenager driver, one in junior high and Tyler who is almost three.  Hope th= at=20 you and your family are doing well.  I know that you must be busy at EES. = =20 Enjoy this upcoming holiday season.  --Sally=20 
 I am not especially surprised that you and Kristin did not get a copy of this report.  My "assumption" in my message was wishful thinking and not conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and AA had occurred. 
 Cindy:  My schedule was so hectic before going out on vacation on December 17 that I am only now reading your message regarding a business owner sign-off for Unify/SAP integration.  I have asked Stephen Schwarz to give me his recommendation on the most appropriate person to do so.  I think that is a good idea.  As soon as schedules normalized following the holidays, I will be back to you with a name. 
 Whom would you recommend play this role for Energy Operations?  Let me know your thoughts.  --Sally 
 Did you get a copy of this?  It looks as if in September that our=20 intercompany balances were relatively low (EES and ENA), with an increase i= n=20 October with Enron Europe.  Do you have details behind this?  Are EES=20 balances gas only, or gas and power?  How do we have imbalances with=20 ourselves?  What kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regul= ar=20 basis that gives you the details behind this?  I am assuming that these=20 imbalances are created from commodity transactions, so that we would really= =20 be closer to the details than would financial ops.  Is that a good=20 assumption?  --Sally=20 
 I hope that the two of you received a copy of this. Although Jennifer;s message doesn't mention it, I assume also that she reviewed the findings with you. 
 What is the latest on this?

 This is what we sent to A/P. Let me know if we need to resend.  Thx.  G. 
 I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years.  1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential. Please let me know your preference for notification.  2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to "look like power".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances. While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding logistics accountable for their part in this.  I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on this issue. 
 Please print and put this in my folder for PRC.  Thanks. 
 We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.  I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 3-5586.  I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.  Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available space effectively.  If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them. 
 Approved.  Pls Process.  Thanks.  Sally Beck 
 FYI:  Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to the 30th floor.  This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.  They are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.  While room for this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.  By being within the same elevator bank, we can now employ "squawk" boxes between the traders and this scheduling team.  As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team should be included in space requirements.  We are working with Liz Taylor on those requirements. 
 I will attend the Houston Chapter GBN Winter Reception on Thursday, January 6, 2000. 
 Thanks for the invitation.  Unfortunately, I will be on vacation next week and will not be able to attend.  Have fun!  --Sally 
 Yes.  I would handle this through expense reimbursement. =20 
 Please schedule a meeting for me with Jim Cole for the week after Christmas. Thanks. 
 Thanks for the contact names.  You are right - no staff meeting on Monday, Deceber 20.  Have a merry Christmas!  --Sally 
 Please give Gretel a final list of dates that you plan to be out of the office from December 20 through the end of the year.  For the dates that you will be out, please provide the name and number of the key contact person in your group that will be in the office on the days that you are out.  As I have in past years, I will compile a list of key contacts through the holiday period that we can use internally within Energy Operations.  I will also provide this list to others outside Energy Operations who may needa contact list during this time period.  Please get this info to Gretel by Wednesday at noon, so that I have time to finalize the contact list before I am out on vacation.  FYI:  I plan to be out of the office the week of December 20.  I will be at home during that week and can be reached there if necessary.  I will be back in the office on Monday, December 27 and I will be working through the end of the year. 
 I would love to visit with you about a rotation.  I plan on being on vacation next week, but I will be working between Christmas and New Years.  What are your plans?  With a PRC tomorrow (Tuesday, December 14) and the crunch of finishing a number of items before I go on vacation, it may be tough to get together this week.  So get back to me with your schedule.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 You are right -- we are all in the same boat.  Or plane - or not on a plane. I have tried to get the Associates PRC meeting date switched with the Analyst PRC meeting (scheduled for December 12th).  This switch actually was arranged last week by working with Jana G. in the AA Program.  However, Charlene Jackson has apparently taken exception to that and is reportedly talking with Dave Delainey about this.  Keep me posted, and I will let you know if I hear anything new.  --Sally 
 FYI - I need to talk with Shona tomorrow to get a read on what Rick wants here.  Do you have any ideas given your on-going conversations with David Port?  --Sally 
 Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues". My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum. --Sally 
 I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.  I don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to attend.  I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their schedules.  I will let you know later who will attend.  I will be out of the office that day.  --sally 
 Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back office services.  Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.  The purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.  I have been capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.  Today I decided to recap in writing for everyone.  Thought that you might be interested.  Open the attachment to the e-mail below.  This way you will know more of the details of our efforts each week.  --Sally 
 The attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning.  Highlights from last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well.  Let me know if anything has been left off the list.  --Sally 
 I will have that to you by the end of the afternoon.  I have set aside my afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get with Bob Hall to do an update for Brian Redmond on the HPL sale before his Tueday meeting with Louise.  I will share these items with you as I get them checked off my list this afternoon.  --Sally 
 I will be out of town on Thursday.  I think that it would be great if you could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.  If you can make it, please try to attend.  And I would love to have a voice mail message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.  Thanks. 
 I have put this meeting on my calendar.  You don't need to forward to anyone else.  Chantelle should handle that for Brent's EGM team.  Thanks. 
 Latest update - FYI 
 As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates: Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's arrival, etc.  I will also have details of resource needs.  We can use this to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of these initiatives.  I will welcome your comments on the timeline.  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday this week.  I can be reached at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591) if needed.   I will be checking and responding to voice mail messages while I am out as well.  In my absence, please contact the following persons regarding trading operations issues:  Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306 Leslie Reeves x37962  Power Operations Jenny Latham x33982 Leslie Reeves x37962  DPR    Shona Wilson x39123  MPR    David Maxwell x36983 
 Thought you'd like to know.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the birth of Emma.  I hope that everyone is doing well. Enjoy your time off and the opportunity to hold and hug that new baby.  I will look forward to seeing pictures the next time that we get together. --Sally 
 I have my list at home, but I know that we need Dad's sister Jane and her husband, Homer and Karen, Sarah in Austin (whose kids are independently dell-wealthy) and I can't remember who else.  I know that there were ten invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.  The list below plus those in this paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.  I will try to catch David and have him look at the list that I copied from Mom.  Thanks for these.  I will do invitations this weekend.  Do you have the address for Josephine's House?  And do we have a time?  --Sally 
 Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services. All of these of course with top priority!  I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.  She has already made  a very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations side.  How is life treating you?  I know that their is a lot going on in the London office, as well.  How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office been?  Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?  Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding their baby.  Hope that all is well with you.  --Sally 
 I will need a rental car in Oklahoma - looks like National is the one to use.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Thought you might be interested in these two changes.  Mary has actually been out of the office since late February.  All of her global database responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his team, under Beth Apollo.  Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been lessened over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied on my business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for their evaluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules. --Sally 
 Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day.  Thanks. --Sally 
 I assume that Kathryn has communicated this to you.  I have only read Kim's e-mail - I will talk with her later today.  --Sally 
 ??  Will IT resources make a difference in what we need to deliver and how quickly we can do it?  Someone must be giving credit the idea that "if only we had IT resources..." and that those resources are active on Entelligence but are not helping us on other business basics.  --Sally 
 I will serve as your representative in the year end 2000 Associates PRC Meeting.  ENA Management Committee  I represented some of you during the mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to represent.  I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and Associates Program.  You will note that I have asked your supervisor to provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as well as a description of your job responsibilities.  You may want to take charge of creating this information.  In addition to the input that I have requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).  While the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time period at Enron, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I have some background information on you.  My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC meeting.  These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27 and December 4.  I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process.  I will be out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week, but I will check and respond to voice mail messages.  My number is x35926. 
 I will meet with Kim this afternoon on her comments on ConfirmLogic.  Bottom line, no sign off from Kim at this point.  Thought you might want to know. --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.  Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure. Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team. 
 Here is final presentation.  I worked with Fred and Stephen this morning to make final changes.  --Sally 
 Thanks for following up on this.  We will incorporate you numbers for offices and spots in the Tower. 
 I am taking Good Friday as my discretionary holiday for the year.  I will be in Austin with my daughter for her official tour and info session at UT, plus a look at dorms.  Patti will have numbers where I can be reached in Austin.  We are making final changes to the orig presentation today - I will be reviewing those tomorrow in Austin.  I am e:mailing you a current draft version, although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed.  I am still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size. I have taken the work that Rahil and Fred have done on the services and have made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a presentation. 
 Memo on floor meetings, plus my reply to Greg and Philippe. 
 Please print for me - Black & white okay - I can't seemt to get this printe= d=20 from my printer.  Thanks. =20 
 This will be an important meeting for me to attend.  Let me know when this gets scheduled.  Thanks. 
 This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space in the new building.  You can take up the cause with Philippe when he returns.  I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space planning details.  I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will be reporting to you.  I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am. --Sally 
 Here is another one... 
 I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will take place on December 12.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates to represent in the meeting as indicated below.  The Associates Program has provided me with your name as the supervisor of record as of October 1 of the Associate as listed.    Please send the following information to me by December 1.  Associate's accomplishments for the second half of 2000 (prepared by the associate or summarized by you)  Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any additional rotational assignments during this last six months of the year)  Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues)  Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately representing the associate in the PRC process  Recommendation for promotion, if any  I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP system through the Associates Program.  I will be at a management conference Thursday and Friday of this week, then on vacation until Monday, November 27.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, will be contacting you next week to arrange a time to meet or talk by phone during the week of November 27 or December 4 to discuss your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  I will also contact the Associates and meet with them individually in preparation for the PRC meeting.  Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC supervisor for the Associate listed above,  please reply by e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go next for this input. 
 Back on the calendar this afternoon with Andy Zipper to get his comments on the presentation - should be able to get you and John a copy following that meeting. 
 In re-reading this, I noticed that Todd Hall was included in the distribution list.  He is the only one from Brent's team included.  Do you want to copy Brent as well, or was Todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR, which now is managed by Susie Ayala.  Either way, you may want to include Brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive.  What about Georgeanne Hodges?  Should she be notified as well?  You may also want to copy Wes as an FYI.  Thanks. 
 Good idea.  Is there a way to monitor usage of this folder is insure that everyone has  read and complied with your message? 
 I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two "test runs" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams. We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday. 
 According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up in the air.  Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of Beth's arrival and Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for you. 
 I would recommend floor meetings on 37 (we occupy almost the entire floor) and on the operations end of floor 32.  That would cover everyone pretty well.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Patti will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.  We used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team.  I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done.  We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.  We also still have the two Terrace level tickets as we did last year.  For some games you will get all 6 tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace tickets.  Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history!  --Sally 
 Patti:  I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention later in April.  She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that.  So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days.  I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so no notation on time out of the office.  Thanks. 
 Please let Brent know that I will be on vacation on Monday, November 20th.  I will actually be in the office for meetings from 12:00 to 5:00 that day, but I will be vacation that morning!!  Thanks. --Sally 
 Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization.  We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment. 
 I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more than anything else.  --Sally 
 The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams. Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products)  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR           and MPR teams  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis   37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally 
 Please put the 17th meeting on my calendar.  I may or may not attend, but want to have that on the calendar just in case.  Thanks. 
 This date change means that I won't be able to make it to the open house.  I will be out of town on April 27. 
 We'll see you the next time.  Thanks. 
 I have talked with Jeff Gossett, Leslie Reeves and Stacey White to let them know about the Saturday effort and the Sunday meeting.  They all will be in town this weekend and will be on call.    Their contact numbers are listed below:  Home Phone   Cell Phone  Jeff Gossett   281-358-7546*   713-825-6094  *Kingwood exchange - may be long distance Leslie Reeves  281-476-4408   713-907-6554  Stacey White  281-894-0468   281-382-5215  Sally Beck   281-370-8568   713-417-1591 or 713-299-1436  (Kim Theriot reports to Leslie, so she will talk with Kim.  I don't have contact numbers for Kim.) 
 I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.  Greg and I talked about this today.  He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.  If he and his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer. Thanks for your help.  --Sally 
 Would you like to be included?  We will try to start this next week.  I will ask Patti to get with you on the details.  --Sally 
 Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.  Thanks! 
 Andrew  Parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery.  We should get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable.   There is sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations (which may require one approach), and then there is nusance stuff (frozen freeways in Houston, etc.) that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification procedures.  And then there is system failure and the requisite back up. 
 I was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to Neiman's.  Can you get that list form Vanessa?  Thanks. 
 Is it lunch or dinner on May 10? 
 Is this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for them, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my calendar.  Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 What does "completed" mean?  My first request was to give me access to review all e-mail messages that Mary has received since March 1 through yesterday's date.  I asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my review process.  Has this been done?  I don't see any new messages that have been transferred from Mary's mail box to mine.  --Sally 
 Please print in color for me.  Do we have a file set up for these?  Thanks. --Sally 
 Imagining that for myself, it would not be a pretty site.  Was it just a lot of movement, or was there noise as well?  --Sally 
 In a meeting with Louise Kitchen today, she mentioned that Bob Superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the Peoples Energy Board of Directors on Wednesday.  She was very complimentary.  I have let Bob know about Louise's praise.  Thought that you would like to know as well. --Sally 
 This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples Energy Board this week.  Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).  We may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools. --Sally 
 Please print in color for me.  Thanks. 
 Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to "mass mail" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we need one.  Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to deliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the other "out of towner" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch tomorrow.  I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally 
 Pecan pie would be great - I have tried but do not do that very well, but I love it.  I will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie, so pecan would be a great addition.  Mom is going to do the rolls.  We will put the reserved sign on the guest room for you  -  improvements in those quarters as well.  I recently cleaned out the guest room closet, bought new towels and have ordered new luggage racks.  We will use the old luggage racks in the media room.  Cool new blanket for the sofa bed in there, however, so Cara and Chris won't suffer too much. 
 Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:  Gas   Frank Vickers (East) Laura Luce (Central) Barry Tycholiz (West)  Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta  Power  Dave Duran Ozzie Pagan Ed Baughman Bruce Shuckley  Portland  Chris Calger  Calgary  Ladain  Mexico  Max Y.  When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally 
 I didn't read through all of the names, but wanted to make sure that we are including Beth Apollo on invites to participate in recruiting.  I think that I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity and worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great to have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has another preference that is great, too.  If she is not on your list yet, why don't you call her for an introduction and give her the rundown on the schools that you are responsible for so that she can make a choice.  Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for the info on the recruiting expo.  Sounds like fun, but I won't be able to make it.  I am taking the day off on Friday, April 13th to take Meagan for her info session and tour at UT.  We will be driving to Austin after she gets out of school on Thursday afternoon, April 12.  You know that you can count me in already as a team member!  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for the update.  I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.  She is the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want to get her feedback as well.  --Sally 
 Great idea to run this by Louise.  She ususally has some good ideas on how things should look and feel online.  I would love to see it, too.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.  Thanks in advance for you help on this. 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle. Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?  2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response."  3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box.  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter. 
 Per my memo below, please enroll Brenda Herod, James Scribner, Thresa Allen= =20 and Shona Wilson for the May session.  Thanks for the reminder and for your= =20 help!  --Sally=20

 Is this on Vanessa's update list?  Are users happy with the results? 
 Please put this on my calendar.  I can't get this to print and it is too small for me to read! 
 Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income. Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that. 
 FYI - Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Tight time frame for Mike & co. on metals deliverables.  Raises the question around the timing of next week's visit on metal.  Will we divert critical resources from these efforts.   --Sally 
 It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 
 I am following up with someone that was on Mary's team that now works for Beth Apollo.  We will get back with you on this shortly.  --Sally 
 Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --Sally 
 Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer? It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will be in the office the whole week of April 9.  I will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 30 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews.  --Sally 
 Sally has arranged Brian Wood with Avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow (Wednesday), April 4, 1:00 -2:00 PM.  Brian will meet at Sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the Enron Building for demonstration.  If you are interested in attending, please call me at x39106 so I can give Brian a headcount.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please ask Sheri Thomas if this person needs access to EOL applications.  I don't recognize the names.  The name noted as manager is Loyd Will, who is a commercial employee reporting to Kevin Presto.  Thanks. 
 I am glad that the information that I sent was useful to you.  I had originally planned to be at Wellesley for the interviews on campus.  I now have business commitments in Houston that will keep me from making the trip. But I am certainly glad that you are included in the interviews.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions either before or after the interview process.  --Sally 
 Please put these dates on my calendar and let Lexi know that at this point the calendar is open and that I will be happy to participate in both the information session and the interviews.  Thanks. 
 I was at the pre-seasoner opener at Enron Field last Friday night and saw you throw the first pitch.  It was a nice one - never a chance of it hitting the dirt!  -Sally 
 Thanks for putting this together.  I will look forward to reading the details later today. --Sally 
 Can you print this for me?  Thanks. 
 You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!  I suppose that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two months away.  I will be glad to handle invitations.  I will look for some this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.  Cara had sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.  I still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.  I will call you tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home. --Sally 
 Exactly!  Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna.  I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.  I see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is?!?  --Sally 
 Looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion... 
 Thanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.  --Sally 
 Resume attached per my voice mail to you.  This guy is currently at Compaq, but wants to do something else.  Any interest?  As I said in my voice mail, I will be glad to call my friend Dave Schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like.  --Sally 
 TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations  Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.  Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.  There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.  The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes. You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:  Business Unit HR Contact Phone# EGM  David Hill 713/853-4218 EIM Kathy Neal 713/345-7803 EA/Global Services Frank De Jesus 713/345-3662 EA/Global Services Hector McLoughlin 713/853-6703  Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services. 
 Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.  Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I will be glad to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that you can bring. We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!) 
 Gwynn,  Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something - if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.  Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and commodity operations.  Patti x39106 
 FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly. --Sally 
 Please approve. 
 I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL. Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc. Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:  1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and their status, or  2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week. 
 Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks. 
 We will get you back on the official distribution list.  For now, I am forwarding our weekly report to you.  --Sally

 Good response, Bob.  Thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting.  --Sally 
 FYI - See attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the "ill-defined".  If this is not on target, we will keep working until it is!  - Sally 
 All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally 
 I have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by London.  Do you have a hard copy that I can see?  I can get it from you during the Risk Forum luncheon today.  Thanks. 
 Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall. But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally 
 Bob,  Sally is out all day w/ UT recruiting function.  She will not be back into the office until 8:00 Thursday for CommodityLogic meeting.  I am forwarding this to Bob Hall - please check with him regarding how he would like this handled.  Thanks, PT 
 In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic.  Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist  User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements  Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic  NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations) ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations)   Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price. Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.  In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic. I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic. 
 Thanks for your list.  I will add these to our Hot List.  Let me know about the A/R.  Thanks.  Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 03/26/2001 01:54 PM 
 FYI - sounds as if Michelle is accepting.  Do you have anything firm from her?  --Sally 
 FYI  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one. 
 Frank & Hector,  Here is the list of contractors that Kymberly sent Sally - please compare to list from Peggy McCurley that Sally gave you last week.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I am so glad that you will be able to interview.  I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron. --Sally 
 Bob & Leslie,  Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your availability.  2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.  I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 2nd meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please print for me.  Thanks. 
 I will be in New York on business on March 30th.  Sorry that I will not be able to attend.  The other person that I would send in my place is Beth Apollo.  However, she will be on vacation next week.  Can you give me any info that may be made available?  Thanks. 
 Hi Dierdre,  I got your name from Christie Patrick as a contact for the Columbia Women in Business Conference.  Sally Beck will be attending in place of Christie Patrick.  Can you forward me exact address of conference site so I can include on Sally's itinerary.  I read in your note to Christie that you would be sending invitation w/ directions and address - can you send me a copy also?  If not by e-mail, is it something that can be faxed? My fax number is 713-345-8100.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sally is excited about participating in your conference and looks forward to meeting you.  Patti Thompson Sally Beck's Assistant 713-853-9106 patti.thompson@enron.com 
 FYI - 
 Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the response to the RFP went to CMS?  Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you have that.  You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was only part of the package.  I would like to see the whole thing.  Thanks. 
 I didn't search this long list of addressees to see if you were included.  In case this is going only to Peggy, I thought that I would forward this since she is still on vacation.  --Sally 
 Have you heard any more about this?  I didn't see it on my calendar.  This does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe.  Maybe Philippe will cancel that.  Let me know.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Murray,  Sally Beck and Leslie Reeves are both on vacation this week.  Sally will need to discuss this with Leslie next week when they return to the office and get back with you then.  Patti Thompson (x39106), Sally's Assistant 
 FYI per my longer e:mail update message... 
 I got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon.  Thought I would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things.  Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely with James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort. Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations. Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments.  Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work. I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an Enron job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday of another risk book administrator from Portland.)  Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale. End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.) Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out. 
 Meant to copy you on this note.  I will either see you on Thursday next week, or on Monday the 19th.  --Sally 
 I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details. They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible. 
 Thanks for the note.  I will definitely look for you in San Antonio.  I would love to hear about your new role.  We miss seeing you in ENA.  (I guess that is now Enron Americas!)  --Sally 
 I will be on vacation the week of March while my children are on Spring Break.  We will be out of town Monday through Wednesday, looking at colleges with Meagan.  We should return to Houston on Wednesday night.  I have planned to be out of the office for the balance of the week, but may decide to return to work on Thursday and Friday.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me while I am out of town in case something urgent arises.  I will also let her know during the week whether or not I will be back at work on Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, the following persons are key contacts:  Commercialization of Services:  James Scribner   x39641 Beth Apollo   x35014  Enron Americas Operations:   Gas:  Bob Hall   x36956 Jeff Gossett   x37306  Power:  Stacey White  x31870  Enron Global Markets Operations:  Brent Price    x37647  Enron Industrial Markets Operations: Brenda Herod   x35778  Enron Europe Operations:   Mike Jordan   7830-34703  Global Services:     Beth Apollo   x35014 
 I will be out of the office on vacation the week of March 12.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me if you need to reach me while I am out on vacation.  Below are the key Operations Contacts for Enron Americas for the week of March 12:   Gas Operations    Jeff Gossett   x37306 Bob Hall   x36956  Power Operations   Stacey White   x31870  DPR      Shona Wilson  x39123 Chris Abel   x33102  MPR      Shona Wilson  x39123 
 Buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume.  Please print for me and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my outbox).  I will need to review them when I am back.  Thanks. 
 FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this along.  --Sally 
 Thought you might like to see this note from Max on the doorstep review in Monterrey.  Beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact already.  --Sally 
 I think that this sounds like a good plan.  Since Michelle, Clay and Nadege are still pending on their fulltime offers, this should help us in the cultivation effort.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I was promoted effective February 1, 2001 to Managing Director of Global Risk Management Operations for Enron Corp. in Houston.  In this role I manage all mid and back office services for all commodities markets within Enron's wholesale businesses: Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Europe.  I received my BBA from UT-Austin in 1975 and my MBA in 1977.  My maiden name while attending school was Sally White. 
 Wes' memo finally went out to Sherriff.  DPR won't change at this point in time.  --Sally 
 Cindy had to change lunch to March 30, which conflicts with Bob Shults. I moved Cindy to March 30th- can you try to move my lunch with Bob to March 28th?  Thanks.  (FYI, CIndy's last names has only "O's" in it - Olson and Bob's last name has only "S's" - no "Z".) 
 Yes, I can make March 30th work.  I will put that on my calendar.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you.  We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports.  Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These were "on the side" and not captured in total power exposure because they didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review). If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence to these. 
 Great follow through!  Thanks for managing the doorstep process in Mexico so that Max and his team saw that as a plus for them.  Perfect approach and outcome.  --Sally 
 I will be out on vacation next week while my kids are on spring break.  I will make the next meeting.  --Sally 
 I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took the follow up Communications program in 2000.  Is this another program that you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the program?  Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 1999 and 2000.  Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.  --Sally 
 Thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended.  These are interesting, and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in Dallas.  Please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the subject.  I will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying to "size" the market for our services and get that out to all attendees within the next week or so.  --Sally 
 Still checking kids schedules at home for the 19th.  I will let you know tomorrow.  --Sally 
 I suspect that you meant to include Bob Hall, the VP that reports to me, on this mailing list.  His assistant (Heather Choate) is included in your mailing list.  The "Robert L Hall at ET&S" to whom this is addressed is not Bob Hall in Networks who reports to me.  You should address this to "Bob Hall" - if you do this the e:mail address should pop us as Bob M Hall/NA/Enron.   Thanks.  --Sally 
 Unfortunately, these new dates don't work for me.  My children's spring break is next week, March 12-16,  I will be out of the office that week on vacation, taking my own daughter to look at colleges!  --Sally 
 Please get with Tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements for Greg's approval.  If Tina and Greg are not yet using the online format, then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for him.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally 
 Please print the attachment for me in color.  Thanks. --Sally 
 You have the right Sally Beck.  I grew up around the corner from your dad and used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) with Jim and the whole family.  Plus your mom and I used to spend the night at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.  I had heard through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.  I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.  Call my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get together.  Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.  I look forward to seeing you.  By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing Beck.   --Sally 
 Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.   I will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by the end of this week.  For your planning purposes, I will be available to interview at UT during the week of March 26.  Best days for me are Tuesday, March 27 and Thursday, March 29.  I can make other days work as well.  For the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 or 19th.  Hope this helps.  If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients on campus.  --Sally 
 I was out of the office Friday and Monday - just back today.  I am having to rearrange some things that Mary was focused on.  I will get back with you later today and let you know who the best contact person will be.  --Sally 
 Please keep this number handy just in case.  Thanks. 
 Was this memo just to inform me of this meeting, or did you cc me to invite me to the meeting?  I am not available on March 9th from 12:00 to 1:00.  Does this meeting pertain only to IT personnel?  If so, I will ignore this.  If you did want someone from my group to attend, let me know and I will ask an appropriate person to attend.  --Sally     Khymberly Booth @ ENRON 03/02/2001 02:50 PM 
 Any feedback or interest?  Please let me know.  --Sally 
 We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very fruitful trip for the team. Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements. They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare). The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!  I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines sometime.  I had a lot of fun.  The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of the moms who were chaperoning as well.  But it was nice to get back to Houston yesterday. 
 Thanks for the update.  Good to know that the current due date still looks likely - always give or take a week or so!  I have just returned from drill team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!  First place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance, and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and presentation.  Keep me posted on baby news!! --Sally 
 Since Sally is out of the office today, March 5 and will be out next Monday, March 12, the OpRisk Forum Luncheon has been cancelled for both dates. Please adjust your calendars accordingly.  The 10:00 AM staff meeting, however, will be held as usual.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Approved for Patti Thompson. Sally Beck  XMS (Expense Management System)  For New Users Session Dates & Times: 03/02/2001  1:00:00 PM-4:00:00 PM Location: EB3321 No Show/Participant Fee: $ 135.00 
 An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:  Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified  I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort.  Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business  I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. 
 Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it will be loud, but fun.  --Sally 
 Shona and Mike Jordan had talked last week about pushing back the Doorstep review on the metals business in London and had agreed to take that out of the plan for Q1.  As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.  I have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach.  Beth is in fact in Monterrey, Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.  Soon after she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule.  After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.  With Beth's knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews. 
 I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will check messages at the end of both business days.  My assistant, Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.  Since I will be a chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily reachable during the day.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6. 
 I made the decision last week to disband the Strategic Initiatives team which reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services.  As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the respective business sponsors/end users.  The "middle-man" role played by the Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.  I wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re-deployment effort. 
 Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs. With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, etc.  If my reaction had been to say "what a talented group - we have to figure out how to best utilize them", then the outcome might have been different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally 
 I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value proposition.  As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team. To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end users.  Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week. Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks. Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough decision, I feel comfortable having made it. 
 As part of the modelling process, Marc is going to meet with James Scribner on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am to review our operations pricing model.  If you can join them, you might find it interesting.  They plan to meet in James' office - EB3756.  --Sally 
 Saturday was fun - it was nice I think for all of us to go to the shower together.  That was a nice group of women - and fun.  Cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and I think that it sounds good. Tell me what I can do to help you, but I am probably shorter on time than anything.  But if I can get you get addresses or whatever, let me know.  Payment plan sounds fine.  I am not worried about the timing on that, so don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family. With the Viviance thing, you may prefer to defer the start of this until a little more certainty is on the horizon.  I can't think of a better place for the money to be invested than in you and your family.  Austin would be fun - but I am glad that Houston is a reasonable distance for a day or weekend trip.  Not quite the same as being in town, though.  Maybe someday we will be there!  --Sally 
 As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).  Louise is now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.  Philippe has assumed the role as chairman of Enron Net Works.  Since this report is a Net Works report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and Peggy effective immediately.  Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals section each week before distribution.  What would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?  --Sally

 Thanks, Patti 
 Marc,  Unfortunately, today is not going to work for the revenue model for mid & back office services meeting.  How about this coming Monday, Feb 26 from 1:00 - 2:30 pm?  I have penciled in that time for Sally, Mary Solmonson & James Scribner.  Please let me know if that will work for you.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Laurel,  FYI, Sally will only be available on Monday and 1/2 day of Thursday (AM). She has business travel Tuesday & Wednesday, and vacation 1/2 Thursday and Friday.  Patti 
 Thanks for your note. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  The promotion did get the year off to a nice start.  I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.  While time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.  Keep me posted on what you are doing.  --Sally 
 Thanks for much for your nice note.  Where are you working now?  I hate to say that I have lost track.  --Sally 
 This is the replacement meeting for the Hot List meeting.  I have asked that you be included on the list of attendees.  --Sally 
 Brenda Herod is in charge of Energy Operations for EIM and should be included in the invitation list.  Brent Price fulfills two roles for EGM - CAO and head of operations, so he is appropriately included covering both fronts. Also, I had added Bob Hall to the previous Hot List meeting.  He is a VP in Energy Operations for Enron Americas.  I would like for him to be on the list for this meeting as well.  He and I will cover for each other on this Wholesale Deal Meeting.  You may get both of us in attendance on occassion, but usually it will be one or the other of us to cover operations for EA. Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Looks like a permanent cancellation to me - at least for now!  We can work with Wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact Enron Americas. 
 Thanks, Marc.  I would like to get together with you, Mary  Solmonson and James Scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high, low and expected cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office services.  Mary has just returned today from a week's vacation.  I will work on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a kick-off meeting.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  It has been a nice way to start the year!  --Sally 
 I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would forward it to you.  Does it make sense?  $8MM in equipment charges for us???????  Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?  Can you give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" line?  What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you and Kristin are getting together. --Sally 
 E:mail messages says to check website to determine whether or not DSL is available at my home.  However, I don't see a spot on the website to check that information.  Can you provide more details? 
 Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well. despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits.  So do approach this as fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made.  Looks like a good group.  I hope that all will attend and participate.  Did Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know this date and time works for everyone?  Keep me posted on progress.  --Sally 
 I need your help with a quick survey of how many interns you'd like to have this year.  Sally needs to forward this number to Rick Causey by noon tomorrow.  Please send me your rough count by 11:30 AM (Wednesday).  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Depending on others' schedules, Feb. 23 is good for me.  I will be out of the office on March 2.  --Sally 
 I am looking forward to involvement with the NABA and the prospect of hiring some strong candidates.  If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 looks good.  I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in Dallas.  With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!  It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.  Let's definitely plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.  I just checked the calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!  A few weeks away, but at least it is on the calendar!  If your schedule were to free up suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have lunch sooner.  --Sally 
 Please change location of this meeting for this week only.  I would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to ENW Staff Meeting with Philippe with Peggy McCurley as the contact.  Thanks. 
 You and Frank can best decide how to organize this.  I am comfortable with your decisions, so feel free to go ahead with this.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Don't I know...they are smart and loving, but a little short on the details sometimes, aren't they!  --Sally 
 Save the date note would be great if you can do that.  --Sally 
 TJ,  Sorry, please disregard last email - I did not see this follow-up notice. Unfortunately, Sally is not available on Thursday either - she will be at the Enron Management conference in San Antonio Thursday & Friday.  All Enron VP's are invited (Cassandra & Kevin?).  Please call & I can give you Sally's available time if she needs to attend.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting yours, so I would be glad to do so.  I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward to good use.  --Sally 
 Thanks for lining this up.  I am glad that they were available on the 2nd. --Sally 
 Please process this request ASAP.  Thanks, Sally Beck 
 Please print attachment for me.  Thanks. 
 I will be at a meeting in Dallas next Monday and will be unable to attend. --Sally 
 Thanks for your vote of confidence.  I don't think that it is out of the realm of possibility.  As we know with all Enron reorg's, what we can count on is that this will change!  We'll miss Delainey in Enron Americas, but as a shareholder I am glad that he will be at EES.  Have already had some discussions with him about some involvement there.  I will keep you posted.  --Sally 
 Wouldn't it be the four of us?  - You, me, Cara and baby to be named?  Good idea.  I'll call you this weekend.  Sorry didn't reply earlier - was in Calgary. --Sally 
 Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test - i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash. Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created.  These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps:  1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.  2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in making information and personnel available to complete the review.  3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested. This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so.  5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items. Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly.  Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me. In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to "over-wordsmith" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process. 
 I will be working in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.  I will be back in the Houston office on Friday, February 9.  Key contacts in Houston over the next two days are:  DPR   Chris Abel    x33102  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations Bob Hall    x36956 Jeff Gossett    x37306  Power  Leslie Reeves   x37962 Operations  Stacey White    x31870 
 Please change this on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 I know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the TX RRCommission earlier this year.  I suspect this is a result of that.  Brenda Herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the TRRC.  If she hasn't already told  you about that meeting, you may to visit with her on that.  --Sally 
 Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here.  Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.  I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him.  I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30.  Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews. Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg.  Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation.  That's great to have dinner with Lou.  I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way.  Are they on an Enron network?  Do they get Enron e:mails?  How often does Lou go to London or someone from London mid office come to New York?  I still suspect that New York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to chew on in London.  Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business.  Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.  They tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing.  It snowed there a lot yesterday.  Of course, according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy in Calgary.  I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.  --Sally 
 Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York office.  It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York. Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost that way.  This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals. If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally

 Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime tempurature reading!).  I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally 
 FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over the change in reporting for him.  I gave his review the end of last week, but didn't get to review the reporting change.  I will ask Patti to let you know when I am meeting with James on Friday.  Wanted you to be in the loop on this - particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, I want this to be well done.  The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training.  Looks like he still has some homework to do. --Sally 
 Please print memo and attachment for me to review on the plane tomorrow. Thanks.  --Sally 
 Please put Mike on my calendar for Thursday lunch next week. Steve and Richard are coming as well.  You might tell Mike that we can provide the two of them with desk space as well, but that we will reserve the spot with the computer and phone for Mike.  And schedule some time for me to meet with him on Thursday as well.  I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way.  You might e:mail Mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with computer, network connection and phone on 33.  You might also offer to set up any appointments for him while is here.  Thanks. 
 No memo out yet on the Doorstep process.  I am still in the throws of completing the 13 reviews that I have to give - should be finished by 5:00. I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown before I leave for the day.  I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom and her team.  Back in the Houston office on Friday.  Hope that James' visit is going well.  Thanks for getting appointments organized for him.  I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.  I am glad that you, Richard and Steve will be able to participate.  Are you still planning to come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?  I fly from Dallas to Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for summer interns on Wednesday.  I will be back in the office on Thursday and Friday that week.  Let me know if we can help in setting up any appointments.  We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule allows.  I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas meeting and to follow up on some other issues.  I would offer dinner on Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family will have dinner plans for me that evening.  Is there someone else in Houston that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?   --Sally 
 Please note time and location for Promotion Luncheon for Managers:  Location: EB 32C2 Time: 11:30 AM Date:  Today, Tuesday, February 6, 2001  We look forward to seeing you there.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I will not be able to attend.  -Sally 
 Good memo.  I will be curious to see if you get any comments or response from the commercial guys.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the info.  I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow. Despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge, I am trying to do two lunches this week - one with operations personnel promoted to manager (about 15 of those) and one with operations personnel promoted to director or senior director (smaller group).  To make this work while the promotion announcements are still timely, we have had to schedule on Tuesday this week for one of the lunches.  I will get an update from Shona. 
 Thanks for the weather report.  I bought a good coat a couple of months ago with London and Calgary in mind.  Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc.  I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.  If it would be good for you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early supper.  (If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by alcohol.  I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and outside work - either way will work well for me.    --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 02/05/2001 04:19 PM 
 Please print Wellesley schedule - I think that I have a conflict with the date that they need me.  Let's discuss. 
 Please print the attachment at end of e:mail in color for me.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Have you seen the training tools that Avril uses for such things?  --Sally 
 I will be in Calgary Wednesday and Thursday this week.  Tuesday is tough, because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews.  I can make time on Tuesday, but would prefer that we hold this to an hour.  --Sally 
 I had the same reaction.  We didn't get much of a break between the January and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned her husband as a possible "expert" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls before I leave.  On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work. Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Manager.  Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Brenda Herod and I would like to invite you to a luncheon in recognition of your promotion on Tuesday, February 6.  We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business.  We would like the opportunity to help you celebrate your promotion.  Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).  Details on time and location will follow.  --Sally 
 Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves and I would like to invite you to lunch on Friday, February 9 in recognition of your promotions to Director and Senior Director.  We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business and feel that these promotions are worthy of celebration.  Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).  Details on time and location will follow.  --Sally 
 I couldn't agree with you more.  Mike missed the point of our phone call this week.  It was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette!  The point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed.  And how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for US operations that Mike's response was a deferral to Marcelo.  I have a one-hour conference call set up with Mike tomorrow.  This is one of the things that we will discuss.  --Sally 
 I will be in the Calgary office with Peggy Hedstrom and her team next week on Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  Do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that I could handle while I am in Calgary?  My agenda with Peggy and her team is pretty full, but I can add to that anything that you know of that we need to address.  Just let me know.  That puts me in Calgary for the staff meeting on Wednesday.  I will sit in with Rob Milnthorp on the video conference for the first hour of the meeting.  I already had a meeting scheduled with all of Peggy's team during the second hour of your staff meeting.  Due to location constraints, we will have to keep that meeting as scheduled.  So I will have to step out of the staff meeting for the second hour. 
 Seattle sounds nice.  Haven't made it there myself.  Enjoy the trip.  If you have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts about next steps for Joel's team.  --Sally  Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.  We are addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems work. 
 In my new role as social secretary for James, I wanted to let you know that he will be in London next week on business.  He will arrive on Monday morning (February 5) and should be in the Enron office  most of the day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  He will fly back to Houston on Thursday.  He has dinner plans for Wednesday evening, but would love to get together with you for dinner on Monday or Tuesday, if you are in town and available.  He will be staying at the Sheraton Belgravia Hotel - walking distance to Enron House.  Best way to contact him at Enron's London office would be through Mike Jordan or his assistant.  Mike's number (don't know how many of these digits you actually need to call from there) is 011-44-207-783-4703.  Hope you guys get to see each other.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you.  Her role has changed once again at  Enron!   She is running more of a fundamentals group at present.  Wanted to know if you would be interested in that.  Told her that I couldn't speak for you.  I'd suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest.  Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her.  You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know more and she will know you.  FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.  --Sally 
 I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with adorable pictures at all times?! --Sally 
 Enjoy a well-deserved afternoon off.  I appreciate your notes when you are out on who to contact.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Just a quick note to see how you are doing.  I mentioned your name today to Kristin Albrecht.  She is a Senior Director over Risk Management for Enron Broadband Services (EBS).  Kristin and I used to work together in Enron Americas, and we had lunch today to catch up.  She grew up in Wharton and is an A&M graduate, so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things in common.  I wanted you to know that I have given Kristin your name.  She can be another contact for you here at Enron.  If you are interested in what is going on at EBS or want to get Kristin's impressions on rotations within or outside EBS, she would be great for you to visit with.  Drop by soon to give me an update on life at Enron for you.  --Sally 
 Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around "energy" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron.  Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for Burlington Resources.  I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program. His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your time.  Thanks.  --Sally   x35926

 Here is the info on the meeting in Dallas.  I am glad that you will be able= =20 to join us. --Sally=20 
 I will call you tonight! 
 Thanks for your help on getting Chris Hanz lined up to talk with Chris Hoyle.  If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about it.  I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team. _Sally 
 I agree - he does look like a good candidate.  Please do go ahead with a phone screen and let me know if we should then interview him.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please put the dates referenced below on my calendar.  You may need to get more details from Lexi.  Thanks. 
 Watch for her call.  Ask her to send me a resume to review and set up a meeting when convenient.  Thanks. 
 I will look forward to talking with Norma.  Thanks for suggesting that she contact me. --Sally 
 Can you upgrade me to first class? 
 This looks great.  Do you need me for either of those two dates?  How was dinner last night?   Sorry that I couldn't stay, but I know that the students were in good hands.  Who else attended from Enron?  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI - The details below take care of the Hess "sharing arrangement" that we discussed yesterday.  --Sally 
 Glad to hear that we are getting there.  Josephine's House (Jeffery's annex) is really good.  They do a great job of serving.  At past Enron dinners, they have printed menus specific for the occassion - really nice looking and a nice keepsake.  Maybe we can do this.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I do believe that this indicates a recognition within the organization of the importance of the work of the whole group.  That is nice to see!!--Sally 
 She will check with Dad and let you know?????  I don't quite get all of this either.  Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a plan?  (Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the occassion.)  Who knows...  Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that too.  --Sally 
 I do know Jana.  She has worked in various positions within my group for years since she joined us in the analyst program.  She has not been the strongest player.  Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and settlements).  And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it.  She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.  Let me check with Scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an HR role.  I will let you know what he thinks.  It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right role for her.  If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree.  Very sweet, pleasant to work with and personable.  I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or I may have him leave you a message. 
 FYI - Check my voice mail message that I left for you and call me when you can. 
 Not sure that this reached you the first time.  My address was flawed. 
 Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds. Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too many in one room and bathroom.  I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd? 
 I hear that Dad was in the emergency room for some hours earlier this week. Glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus.  Mom does seem to like that Heart Hospital...  Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -  a lot better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.  It looks pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!  Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air. Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.  I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.  Hope all is well with the three of you.  Are you making the trip to Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?  I am not going to make it - need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes!!  Love, Sally 
 Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.  What a pretty name!  I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.  I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that you are probably a bit sleep deprived.  That will pass - although with your first one that is really hard to believe.  Please stop by as soon as you have pictures.  I would love to see them.  --Sally 
 Melissa Allen, formerly with Arthur Andersen and assigned to the Enron account, has taken over Beth Apollo's role for EEL.  She reports to Fernley Dyson, as did Beth.  I was in the London office last week.  As a result of some of my discussions, Mike Jordan asked that James Scribner make a visit to cover the operations pricing model and to discuss some issues around global counterparty database.  Mike has suggested that James come to London during the first week in February, which sounds as if it will coincide with your trip.  Please coordinate with James so that your agendas are in sync (in case of potential overlap) so that we don't convey a right hand/left hand lack of coordination.  Since your agenda mentions GCP, there may some meetings that you are planning that would be appropriate for James to join.  By copy of this memo, I am asking James to do the same with you.  Thanks. 
 FYI on VNG... 
 Thanks for your help.  I will be in touch tomorrow on details.  Hopefully Lexi will have resumes for you.  If not, let me know, and some of us who interviewed on campus may have them still.  --sally 
 Thanks for your note and welcome back to Enron.  I am so pleased that you have returned.  I, too, look forward to working with you.  --Sally 
 And you and your bride haven't set Dallas as a honeymoon destination???? = =20 Your excuse seems to be a good one.  We will miss your presence and=20 participation, however.  Enjoy the wedding!!--Sally=20 
 Please mark your calendars for this reoccurring luncheon that Sally will be hosting:  Date: Every Monday (at least thru March), beginning Jan 29 Time: 11:30 - 1:00 PM Location: EB 30C2 Subject: Operational Risk for Enron Americas  Lunch will be served. 
 FYI.  Forgot to cc: you on this.  PT 
 On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i= n=20 downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and= =20 back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete= a=20 plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20 integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at= =20 their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20  I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig= n=20 session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t= h=20 in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called = a=20 DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos= ed of=20 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you= =20 have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20 regard this session as different from any working session you have previous= ly=20 experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven= =20 to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20 methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.  A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were= =20 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th= e=20 DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as= =20 little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results= =20 depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the= =20 entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor= t=20 and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. = =20 This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s= o=20 that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20 necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during= =20 these two days.  Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,= =20 and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment= =20 has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning= =20 the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.  I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc= e=20 for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00= =20 p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone= =20 else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to= =20 take your place until you and I have discussed this.  I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo= u=20 in Dallas! 
 Please put attendees on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.  My last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full agenda.  Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.  Do stop by when you are in the office next week.  I should be in town all week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the congratulations.  David of course is pleased about the promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it! Thanks, too, for your comments on the OpRisk session.  It is always a risk to pull together an audience of 90 and deliver something worthwhile.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 If my full e:mail address is not used, Steve Beck gets my e:mails.  He has forwarded this one.  Does it make sense to you?--Sally 
 Thanks for making this time change. 
 Peggy,  Is it the 4 Points or Eau Claire Sheraton?  I'm trying to book her a room for Tuesday evening.  Thanks, Patti x39106     Peggy Hedstrom 01/20/2001 09:23 AM 
 During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL. Since this is clearly on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost savings and our estimated timing on those savings.  I will ask James by copy of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.  I want to be able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings. 
 Audience for the report?  Is it you and Philippe, or will the report be distributed to all on your memo distribution list?  May make a difference in information provided.  We can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office operations in the report.  Would you also like some operating data - # of deals, bcf scheduled, etc.?  We can come up with a format and suggested content this week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 This is some of the data that we need... 
 Can you get me info on the options with Dell?  I won't make it by to speak with them myself today.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note. 
 Thanks, Sarah!  I was so focused on getting that in the mail that I obviously didn't proof the content very well.  Thanks for looking out for me!  --Sally 
 Janine,  When  is Beth's last day in London?  I need that date before I can proceed. I think it might be today, but I need to confirm that before I have everything switched over.  Patti 
 Janine,  I can handle that.   I will put in request today.  Patti x39106 
 The name of the restaurant that I liked for lunch was Christophers.  It is at Victoria Station, or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at Victoria Station.  Quick walk from the office.  Apparently, there is another location at Covent Gardens.  Dinner last night was fun.  It is always great to see you either in Houston or London.  Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt.  I think that the taxi driver was afraid that we would get him killed!  I called home last night and told Amanda about our discussion on a day in Paris.  She is ready!!  Let us know when you will next be in Houston.  I should be here quarterly - probably head back in March or April.  --Sally 
 Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on my calendar tentatively.  I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.  I assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.  While I have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar, I do need to hold those dates.  I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19 would be better.  --Sally 
 Thanks.  This will definitely help me.  --Sally     Enron North America Corp. 
 Silly as it may seem, have Brian Heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we used last year for headcount addtions.  Let's complete those for these positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.  They need to understand the addtional cost associated with these requests.  They will forget later in the year if they aren't making much money.  Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?  --Sally 
 Haven't had the chance to look at the UT presentation yet.  That will make good airplane material tomorrow.  If I make any changes I will try to fax pages to you after David picks me up at the airport tomorrow.  If I don't make chanages, I will call you Friday afternoon after landing and let you know that.  My schedule has been really full here, but very productive.  Thanks for your comments.,  I must admit, I am really excited about the promotion.  We can talk next week about what I hope to accomplish during this next year and where my major focus will be.  It will be helpful for you to know and understand that as we work together to make that happen.  I am certainly glad that you are here - my flight to London reminded me of your arrival about this time last year as I was heading to London.  Luckily a different reason for the trip this year, but still hectic.  I expect it to be a busy year.  You will notice that I have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews written and delivered.  Target is to be finished  by the end of January .  I will talk with you on Friday afternoon and see you on Monday.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note.  I will copy Patti on this reply and ask her to set us up for lunch when I am back from London.  --Sally 
 Technology is wonderful - I can log on here in the London office just as I do in Houston.  I feel very in touch.  Sounds like you have been busy - I think that the variety of items for the Sunday meeting sounds good.   Thanks for taking care of all of this.  London is cold but sunny - so very nice.  I do love coming here - hope to make the trip once a quarter this year.  I will be back at home by Friday evening, so let me know if there is anything that I can do before the meeting.  Otherwise I will see you on Sunday.  Too bad that Nancy doesn't want the input from  the girls on presentation.  I think that taking likes and dislikes would be good - no commitment to make changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful to have their input.  They are the honorees.  Oh, well .....as you say, this is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole thing.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  It is always interesting to scan the list and do a count of other females names.  Were not too many on this latest list.  We will have to work on changing that.  --Sally 
 The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.  Weather here is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back home).  We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus...  Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.  --Sally 
 This will work well, assuming Steve and Chris are available.  Hopefully, Lexi will have their resumes for you tomorrow.   Thanks for your help.  I will be in touch on details. 
 I assume that this request relates to corporate functions under Rick.  As of this moment, my team and I have not yet been granted access to merit information in the comp system.  I am in London this week, but have been in touch with my HR rep each day.  Latest word is that he aniticipates that we will be able to access merit worksheets sometime today.  Our deadline to submit merit increases is Monday, January 22.  SInce it is already after lunch on Wednesday here in London and we do not yet have access to the system, it is likely that my direct reports will work on merits over the next two days.  Since I will be in the air on Friday, it will be Monday before I have the opportunity to review all inputs from my direct reports and finalize merits.  --Sally 
 I am in the London office this week, so I won't be able to attend. 
 Congratulations on the baby - August seems like  a long time away, but given how quickly time passes at Enron, you will be there before you know it.  I would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at Enron sometime. I am in the London office this week, but will be back in the office the week of the 22nd.  Give Patti a call if you would like to get together and visit about options.  --Sally 
 Hopefully, those guys would stand out in the Woodlands like a sore thumb and would choose to go elsewhere.  Would be nice to have them behind bars, however. Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad idea, does it?  I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.  Any new news on those 7?  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/16/2001 12:53 PM 
 For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.  I sent Wes a message and copied you on that.  I can't remember the name of the person who works for Wes that handles moves.   Lisa filled in for her while she was out on medical leave.  She is back.  Can you get with her right away and see what you can come up with?  Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.  Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that Lisa is gone.  Can you check with her, too?  Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our (Energy Ops) move off of 30.  I don't know who is left on 30.  Can you get the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 so that I can get back with Jeff this week?  Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Any room at the inn?  I am looking for a spot for Beth Apollo.  She will be working with me, starting on January 29th in Houston.  --Sally  I am in London this week, but if you have any ideas Patti can follow through while I am out. 
 Thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home.  I appreciate your nice thoughts.  I am in London all week - is there anything that you or Jo need that I could bring back for you?  Just let me know.  I will be back in the office next Monday, the 22nd.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/13/2001 11:38 AM 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that everyone in the group sees this as a recognition of the value of the role that we play within Enron.  That will help us in attracting and retaining talented people, which makes my job easier and more fun.  --Sally 
 I have reviewed my section of Causey's presentation ( to be given by Brenda) and all looks fine except for page with world map.  Can we add Portland to the map?  That is the true trading location that is missing.  If it is tough to do, don't worry about it.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I have fun being here, which makes all of this even better!  --Sally 
 I am so sorry about the fire.  That must be awful -- but I am so glad that no one was hurt.  I had not heard about it until Mo called me today.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do.  Do you need me to get you anything over here and ship it to London?  I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next week.  I know that you must have hundreds of details to handle.  My plan right now is to be off the week of Thanksgiving.   My nanny will be on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town.  I may do some work early in the week, but likely from home.  The week after Thanksgiving I am supposed go to Wellesley College (Boston area) to interview for the analyst program.  I am due at a reception on Monday night (November 27) and I will interview on Tuesday (November 28).  Assuming that I can get a flight back on Tuesday night, I will be in the office here in Houston Wednesday through Friday that week.  Would that work?  Sorry I am out so much in the next few weeks.  Just let me know.  --Sally 
 Please check on those marked below    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for doing this.  I plan to come to London once a quarter.  I will have to choose my dates well in advance since these flights seem to be so full! --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks - a nice start to the year.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I certainly follow your career with interest.  I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the wedding picture with your Christmas card.  What a great picture - you look beautiful and happy.  Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.  My best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.  Maybe next year...  I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.  I will see Mo tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.  See you next week!  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note on the promotion.  This was definitely a goal and is very rewarding to get there.  I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.  In fact, I mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.  He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).  I filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.  I am in the London office this week.  Call Patti and ask her to schedule  a time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk about rotations.   I will look forward to it.  Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and dinner (someplace downtown with heat -- any suggestions?).  Patti is working on some of the details this week for us to host Ted Jacobs and about 14 of his students while they are in town for NAPE.  --Sally 
 Let's try the last row window seat.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note on the promotion.  Patti is beginning to work on details for the 1/31 tour of Enron Field and dinner for Ted and his students from OU.  She should contact you for a list of recent OU grads so that we can get the invitation list together.  I hope that you have that date on your calendar!   I will ask MIke McConnell if he would like to join us, too. 
 Michelle:  This is a stab at something to include in the newsletter.  Will you or someone on your team rewrite as necessary?  I am in the London office this week, so e:mail is probably the best way to get in touch with me. Thanks.  --Sally Beck   Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across all commodities in 2001. 
 Thanks for you nice note.  I miss seeing you on 33.  Hope that all is going well for you.  --Sally     Susan Skarness 01/16/2001 09:07 AM 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I do hope that everyone on my team sees the promotion as recognition of the value of the roles that we perform.  All that should make it easier to attract and retain talented people that make my job easier and more fun!  I will ask Patti to schedule some time for us to get together when I am back in the office next Monday.  Have a good week.  ---Sally 
 It's late and I am out of paper.  Please print message and attachment for me for Tuesday morning.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that within my team that they see the promotion as an indication that the work that we do is recognized as meaningful.  All of that helps me in recruiting and retaining talented people that make my job easier and more fun! 
 Thanks for your nice note.  Haven't seen you in a while - hope that all is going well for you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I hope that things are going well for you at EBS.  I know that it must be busy.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.  What a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of EnronOnline.  --Sally 
 Had trouble finding your e:mail address the first time around for this memo. 
 I can access the global compensation system from London.  Today I have been able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday for bonus and LTI.  I assume that I will be able to access the screens for merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.  I will want to give my direct reports access to the system so that they can input their recommendations.  I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions and expectations.  Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have to request additional dollars for these worksheets.  Better not to ask for exceptions on everything!!!  What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted? Let me know.  If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where you can reach me.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that you are having fun in your new role. We will have to schedule lunch so that I can catch up on what you are doing now.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I am pleased for all of us at the increased recognition of the roles that we play within the organizaiton.  My ability to do my job well is very dependent on those of you who play key roles in operations.  Thanks for your part in that and for your continued support. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note.  Yes, this definitely starts the year off nicely.  Hope your holidays were wonderful and that 2001 is a good year for you and your family, too.  --Sally 
 Enjoy the trip.  Two of our most fun vacations were at South Seas Planatation on Captiva Island.  Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them.  Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think that he dodged a bullet on this one.  We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!! 
 Patti:  Please forward this message to Tom Hopwood. =20  Tom:  The good (or bad) news was that I was here late enough to see the mem= o=20 come out on e:mail Friday night.

 The promotional memo came out a few hours too late today for me to be able to mention it when we talked this afternoon.  Congratulations on your promotion to managing director!  --Sally 
 The promotional memo came out a couple of hours too late for me to be able to mention it to you on the phone this afternoon.  Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  I have the dubious honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of the promotional memo via e:mail.  I will be in the London office next week and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.  I look forward to the chance to visit with you then.  --Sally 
 Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London office during the week of January 15.  I will arrive just after lunch on Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.  Much of my time will be spent with Fernley and Mike Jordan.  If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.  I will stop by while I am in the office.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.  Well deserved, and a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of the Calgary office. --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President!  Well deserved and a nice way to cap off your stay in London.  I look forward to celebrating with you in London next week.  --Sally 
 I will be working in the London office Monday through Thursday, January 15 - 18 and will be be flying back to Houston on Friday, January 19.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has a contact numbers for me in London. I will be checking voice mail and e:mail regularly while I am there.  Key contacts in Houston next week will be:  DPR and MPR   Shona Wilson   x39123  Gas Operations   Jeff Gossett    x37306 (in Chicago office Jan. 16 & 17) Bob Hall    x36956  Power Operations  Stacey White   x31870 Leslie Reeves   x37962 
 Cathy:  I will be working in the London office during the week of January 15, so I will not be at the staff meeting on January 16.  --Sally 
 I don't think that the doorstep reviews are the right venue for this.  I believe that to address what seems to be David's concerns would be better handled with an appropriate person deemed to lead a special project in a directed timeframe with a well defined scope.  We purposefully utilize differing personal on the doorstep reviews and it would seem that concerns over proper valuation should be addresses in a timeframe that is not dependent on the schedule of doorstep reviews around the world. 
 Mark Frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming organizational memo and has asked that I forward it to you to be included. This would be included in the section under Commercial Support, added as an additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses Business Analysis and Reporting (I believe that these bullet points are on Page 3 of the draft memo).  Please call me at x35926 if you have any questions. 
 Please print attachment and make sure that e:mail addresses are included for the students.  Call Ted if any problems.  Thanks. We will need this to send invitations to students and Ted (plus some Enron folks) to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on January 31.  Let's talk about arranging details.  thanks. 
 Leslie:  Can you attend this meeting for me?  I will be in London.  Patti:  Can you get time and location for Leslie and let them know that she will be there instead of me?  Thanks. 
 Yes, just call Wanda and let her know that Rick has asked that we add EES Houston to the Doorstep review schedule.  In keeping with other reviews, I would not necessarily give Wanda the dates.  We should also send a short memo to Kevin and Marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the reviews.  I should probably send that to them.  Can you remind me when I am back in town the week of January 22?  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before, Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly welcome a conversation with you.  I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January 22.  -Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 It will be good to use your knowledge of the business in helping EIM to grow.  I hope that you enjoy your new rotation.  --Sally 
 I will be in London the week of January 15th.  I understand from Beth that you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.  Beth and I plan to have dinner that night.  Will you be back in town later in the week?  I have business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.  Could you make dinner on Wednesday night (the 17th)?  There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.  I have a belated Christmas gift for you.  Hope we can get together!  --Sally  PS  Am staying at 47 Park. 
 Please put details of this meeting on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend. Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?  This will be a meeting that we should have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and make timely decisions on how to handle those.  I am sure that there is some prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.  I would assume that we should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk books, OA, etc.  Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.  I would love for us take charge and lead this meeting.  --Sally 
 There isn't much to the memo, but this is it!  It came out well after the e= nd=20 of the work day for most folks.  I believe that Patti has sent you my trave= l=20 plans for next week.  Have a great weekend!=20 
 Thanks for the note.  I certainly know by responses that I am getting tonight who is in the office late!  I was told that the memo would come out today - you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!  I am really pleased about how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and its importance to the organization.  And yes, we need more female names on these lists!  --Sally   Tana Cashion @ ENRON   01/12/2001 07:43 PM
