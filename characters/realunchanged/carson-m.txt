 It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redir= ect must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmiss= ion available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at leas= t, there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TV= A.  Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...

 I will be taking vacation days March 13-15.   Twist 3-6203 
 This $27,880 will be subtracted from tomorrows wire(Tuesday 1/22/02).  This amount reflects the $250,000 prepay from last Friday(1/18/02) for the power purchased on Monday(MLK 1/21/02) for delivery Tuesday. 
 There is NO Tuesday markets available today.  We can not wire cash on Monday due to the holiday.  So, Koch will allow us to make to them an "estimate payment",,, aprox $250,000.  We will cover the postions on Monday.  The difference in actual will be netted out of Tuedays payment.  Michael Carson 3-6203

 Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing, which should be fun!  Have a happy holiday!  MC

Check our web site for more information  houalum.zk-state.com.  As we have said  before,  this new SRO has outstanding new televisions and a great sound  system.  The whole place is new and quite spiffy.  However, they still  have the same outstanding hamburgers!  Our new Houston Alumni Club polo shirts are in and will be on  sale Saturday.  Price is $35.00 and these shirts are really sharp!   Purple of course, with black collar and cuffs with a white stripe.    Shirts are perfect for casual business wear and you can boast about Kansas State  at the same time!  We have a limited amount so come early to get your  shirt!  We have ordered new purple tee shirts but have not yet received  them.  They should be here by Saturday and the price will be  $15.00.  SEE YOU SATURDAY!  GO CATS!  Joyce '85 and Ken' 57  Nesmith
