 Margaret,  Just wondering how my Visa was coming along? I had a confusing conversation with Jeanne in relocation services this morning. The way I understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same time or after I leave the country. She seemed to think that I had to go to the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada. Can you shed some light on this?  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork for him.  Chris
