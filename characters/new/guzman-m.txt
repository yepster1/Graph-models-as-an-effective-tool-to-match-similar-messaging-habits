e Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was pretty cool.  I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these girls that I met there until about 5 am.  I talked to Burns a few days ago and I guess he is still seeing that chick.  I didn't ask about the living situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down there.  So anyway how was your New Year.?  How did everything go with Ricky? I would be stoked if you came up for a long weekend or something!  Anyway I gotta run.  Talk to you later! 
 No i guess not I was just giving you some shit and you didn't respond. Usually you respond when I give you shit 
 Herro?
