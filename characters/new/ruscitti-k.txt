I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the 11th. Keep me in mind for next time though.  Kevin 
 Murli,  Great to hear from you.  I'm glad you accepted the offer - I'm sure you'll enjoy you're experience at Enron.  Good luck during your final semester.  Kevin 
 Dan,  Please take a look at the new Purchase agreement and let me know what you think.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 That is if you ever get you LLC set up.  Look forward to trading with you in 2001.  KR 
 Joke, huh? 
 Davis,  Let me know if this helps.  kevin 
 If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis differentials as well. Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying to do.  Kevin x3-6320 
 I received the email.  Thanks,  kevin 
 Dude,  What's your work #.  I need to give you a call.  Kevin 
 T.J.,  I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it. How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the holidays or staying in LA?  Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 You too.  Make sure you tell Paul I said Hi.  Kevin
