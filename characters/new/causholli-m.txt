mments on the FOEX recent trends. I''ll keep that in mind for next time.  Thanks, Monika 
 Andrea,  Attached is the pulp presentation. Please take a look and let me know of any changes or additions. Also, tissue facts are taken from a bank of America report as RISI does not have any studies on it. I found one guy in Germany that seems to do quite an extensive work on tissue. I sent you an email yesterday stating what he can offer us and what the costs are.  Also note that fluff pulp data is very limited. I am waiting David Pinault from RISI to get back to me as he is researching and digging inside his organization to find anything on the fluff pulp. All these data can be added to the presentation upon availiability.   Thanks, Monika 
 Yes I did forget it. Here it is.  thanks, MOnika Causholli
