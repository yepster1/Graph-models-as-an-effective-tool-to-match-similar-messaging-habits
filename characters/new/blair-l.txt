 Terry, I would like for you to attend as well.  Thanks. Lynn 
  I will be on vacation Tuesday, November 20 through Monday, November 26.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, November 27th.  John and Terry are in the office all week and Terry is on call for the holiday weekend for scheduling issues.  Terry and Steve can get a hold of me over the holidays if needed.  For accounting issues, Raetta and Larry will be in the office Tuesday and Wednesday, with Raetta taking a half day vacation on Wednesday.  All of you have a great Thanksgiving with your families.  I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Looks good to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Debra, thanks for your reply.  Are you comfortable now that you can perform this function instead of Raetta if Jean is gone?  Does Jean need to have more specific instructions to cover Transok that specifies the timing for putting the allocations in the system?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tim and Mike, would it be appropriate to have Mike call Bill and get specifics from him?  Then we can do a conference call to explain the cuts?  Just a suggestion.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Don, this is great.  This report was a big hurdle for us.  I will check with the team on how it is working.  Thanks for all your support as we go forward in our Business Objects training. Thanks. Lynn
