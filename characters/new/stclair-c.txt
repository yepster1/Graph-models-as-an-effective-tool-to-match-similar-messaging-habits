 Mark: Thiat sounds right but I would have Leslie take a look at it.  all of this work is in connection with the deal that we inherited from Lou and it all should be allocated to whatever group Bill Windle and Gauarav Babbar are  a part of.

 Suzanne: Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift. Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.  Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.  I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it? I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet (which I know you will).  As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.  Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by for a visit.

 Tana: This should be pretty straight forward.  The only remaining issue was they needed to put in an effective date for the assignment amendment that they wanted us to sign.  The papers should be in my office.  Call me at home if you have any problems.
