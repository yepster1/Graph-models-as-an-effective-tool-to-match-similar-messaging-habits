E 18. HE18-although it shows nothing from the CAISO on their site (their server went down) is the same as HE17-the CAISO specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line. Thanks, Bill 
 Jill, Could you look into my concur expense login/password. I am at a class today and need to approve these expense reports in the system. However,I cannot access the system. I am not sure if this is related to our floor wide network problems or what. Also, we are a go for Edgefield. You and I just need to talk about the expense report.  Thanks,  Bill

 Amy, Hey! Great to hear from you! Hope you are doing well. But... What are you talking about? Who's on what side? And what are you trying to recall?  Bill 
 I know Jim. You guys are doing well.  Thanks, Bill 
 Extra ST-SW transmission can be viewed in the Available Transmission Sheet. B 
 Good afternoon. We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13. Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning. The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3. We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5. This cost us $7.50. We imported it from MEAD 230. We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. This is from Redding.  Finally, ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead. You can query by Enron Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased. If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased. We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning.  Thanks,  Bill 
 Of course.  Deez nuts. 
 Dude-- It was $5. My total bet for the game was $40. $5 to you, $20 to Porter, $15 to Mark Fisher.  Come on...don't try to run me over. The gloating has to be worth $5.  B
