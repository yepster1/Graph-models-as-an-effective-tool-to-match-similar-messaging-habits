 Theta is hurting me but gamma will hopefully come to my rescue.  Waht do you think about these funds buying ENE and its effect on price?  ENE at 70-9/16!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 A good time, indeed!  Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the near future.  I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" or otherwise contribute.  I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your knowledge of business, etc.  We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.  I'm looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around. I added my sisters to the GOPUSA distribution list and may add some others later tonight.  When is the website going to have our pictures?   Thanks,  Charlie
