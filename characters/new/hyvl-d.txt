before the contract is signed by ENA..    Kevin Ruscitti 11/14/2000 12:01 PM 
 Barbara & Anne, I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, Joe would like as much up front notice as possible. 
 Randy, I have attached a simple release and settlement agreement for you use with the customer.  Please call if you need anything further. 
 Veronica, The form of the Guaranty is okay.  Please have them correct the name "Enron North America Corp." in the first paragraph.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 11/14/2000 03:56 PM 
 Now why did you send this to me.  I believe that I was aware that you were out of the office.    Stacy E Dickson 11/15/2000 06:19 PM 
 Can you give me any more information.  What type of deal is it.  Who did the deal.  How was it documented.  Where is the paper work.  etc.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 11/15/2000 12:39 PM 
 Russell, The guaranty documents are attached.  Please impress upon your contact that we need separate guaranty documents for ena and for hpl.  Call if you need anything further. 
 I could use all four.    Janette Elbertson 11/16/2000 11:48 AM 
 Why couldn't this be done with a new GTC confirm for the extension period? 
 Sounds good, count me in.  I will let you know if anything changes.    Lee L Papayoti 05/01/2001 04:15 PM 
 I forwarded a request to Russell for the credit worksheet on 11/08.  No response to date.  I will forward our master to them once I get the credit worksheet.    Jeffrey T Hodge 11/16/2000 01:24 PM 
 Mike, The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please forward to Ami Beard for her review.   I will be in the office all day tomorrow.
