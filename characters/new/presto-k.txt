 proposed 2-ways. 
 The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives:  Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on this project. Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.   If Ben elects to continue to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon. Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton restructuring project.   If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself.    The value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team.  Chris - Do you agree with the above description? 
 New Albany will accept proposal assuming my deductible is limited to $1 million per occurence and my BI deductible is limited to 30 days and includes full replacement revenue (less marginal fuel costs) after the 30 day period.
