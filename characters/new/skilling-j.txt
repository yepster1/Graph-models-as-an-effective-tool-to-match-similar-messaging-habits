 twice, which I believe had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.  That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to the football game Saturday.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Rocky 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Tamara, was Jeff Skilling copied on this e-mail in error or is there something I should be doing?  It means nothing to me, but will be happy to follow up on it  if necessary.  Thanks.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Shouldn't have responded so quickly!  Thanks for the clarification.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I think we have some flexibility on that and am checking it out.  I'll be back in touch as soon as I've resolved that.  SRS 
 Patti, can you believe that out of all those dates you offered that Jeff is only available on October 14?!  I have penciled it in on his calendar as has Rebecca.  We'll look forward to more details.  Thanks, and have a wonderful time in Cabo!  I'm so envious!!!  Sherri
