He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file this "Suggestion of Bankruptcy."  * Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a "debtor in possession" and a trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.
