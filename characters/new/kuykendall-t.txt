 would be there, but that still leaves us short.  i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too much.  the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can possibly be.  kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming. we'll have to get a water basketball goal - pat will love playing with all the kids. 
 hey there!  hope everything is going great with you.  things are still going pretty smoothly with me - thank goodness.  my actual due date is 6/11 so i only have about 2 months left.  i'm starting to realize why people are always miserable in the last couple of months.  anyway - my address is 4419 Stackstone Ln.     Katy, TX 77450.  Talk to you soon. 
 hey beverly -- do you have phone numbers for any of the people that werent there last time?? 
 This is just to remind everyone that bunko is at my house on Monday April 9th.  Please let me know as soon as you can if you are not going to be able to make it.  Thanks and I look forward to seeing all of you there. 
 scott and i talked and we cannot say definitively that triad called us first every single day -- there may have been some days when we called them.  we can call you if you need further explanation.
