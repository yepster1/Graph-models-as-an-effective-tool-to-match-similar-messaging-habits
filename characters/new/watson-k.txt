t.  If not, please let me know so that I can pass it on to someone else.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paula,  Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for Jim, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.  Some of the names we mentioned last night were:  Bill Tarter Lenore Fenberg Muffin Alfred  Any other names that come to mind?  .....Will Eucker, Art, Tammi Semi, Carolyn Brown, Ken O'Neill... are other people who have been involved in various efforts.  Your thoughts?  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI....  I believe Dave N. and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. I've got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, James has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow. The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations? We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy, FYI, I have a call into Tiny to discuss this picture and the ownership of the pipe in question.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Thanks for setting this meeting up.  K. 
 Audrey, here they are....

 Lindy, thanks for looking into this.  I agree with your comments.  Kim. 
 Hi Dot.  Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see what she says.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.
