to have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me know if that sounds good.  Kate 
 Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:  1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask Jeff?  2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"  3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?  4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed deals as well?  Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. Thanks for your help!  Kate 
 Both have been changed to CAISO energy - we have two new Real Time guys training at the same time. Scary!  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be specified as CAISO firm.  Thanks, Kate 
 517814 - added .0075 fee per Chris Mallory  535228 - I'm waiting for Tom's desk to settle down a bit - they're in the middle of trading.  Any idea why APB's just checking these deals out now? They're from the beginning of February. Just wondering.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her number is 703-853-3001.  I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, she said.  I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.  Kate 
 535228 - broker fee added per Tom Alonso 
 I've left a message for Jeff, but I can't seem to find him or his trade log anywhere. Until I hear back, I don't know anything about these deals. I'm sorry! I'll let you know as soon as I hear from him.  Kate 
 Looks like Mark already changed this to 3/28 to 3/31 - looks good to me. 
 Mike confirmed with Natsource this was a 25MW deal with no broker fee. 
 I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/26/2001 03:22 PM 
 I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.  Thanks, Kate 
 Kim - I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the following deals:  557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp? 552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?  And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be confirmed.   Diana - I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty. 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, Montana System, etc.), do we confirm? 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that I'm doing this right. Please let me know.  553666 553667 553668 555174 555175 555177 555178 556365 556366 556367 556368 557665 557666 557667 557668 557734 558952 558957 558958 558959 558960  Thank you both for all your help.  Kate 
 I just entered these deals and backdated them -  562162 - buy Duke 562164 - sell Calpine  Sorry about the delay.  Kate 
 Following are EPMI weighted average trade prices for Tues., March 27. After discussing this e-mail with my manager, we've decided to only send the information previously sent via fax. If you have any questions on individual deals, please don't hesitate to call.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for catching that. It should be good now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office and it just got bumped off the mental "list of things to do." Don't worry - I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!  Kate 
 We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 PREBON Matt Motley 562635  Jeff Richter 562556  Jeff Richter 562546 - corrected to 25 mw  BLOOMBERG Mike Driscoll 562546 - Mike would like to keep this as Pinnacle for now because that is the true counterparty - Bloomberg's system has not been updated  Tom Alonso did not do this deal (he did a BUY  with the same terms)  Sean Crandall 562641 
 Mike Driscoll is entering this ICE trade right now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 02:08 PM
