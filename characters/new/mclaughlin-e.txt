 I paid extra for the 2 Business Day delivery from UPS.  Per the tracking info on their website they have not tried to deliver to my house yet and it has been three business days.  Do I receive some sort of refund or credit?  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Done!

 I corrected it.  Thanks for the heads up.  Errol 
 Please speak with Jason Wolfe regarding this file.  It is for the West desk. I am sorry, from the original sheet you showed me I thought it was ours.  I have forwarded your request to him.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  I just saw you call.  John Arnold is on my phone so I couldn't pick up.  How does Thursday sound for a meeting.  I am available all day until 2:30. Friday is also good for me.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  Friday at 10 am is great.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin
