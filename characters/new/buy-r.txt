to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.  The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.  This process should begin immediately.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.  Rick
