 Here is my mark-up.  Please make sure that it is factually correct. 
  I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.  If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices.

 Sherry called Kim the other night to see if he would run for the HOA.  Surely there must be more to this.  Why wouldn't the HOA pay their bills?   I'll have to ask Joe Carrabba tonight.

 I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.  This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue...... 
 You don't need to keep the attachment.  I was going to read it online -- but since you've printed I'll take it along for casual reading.   I just want to add Liz Gras email address to my contacts.  Sorry for the confusion.
