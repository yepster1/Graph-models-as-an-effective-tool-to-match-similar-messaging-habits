filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.  Thank you,  Stacy Dickson Granmayeh
