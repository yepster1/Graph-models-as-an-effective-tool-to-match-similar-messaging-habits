 Dear Curt-- thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions. 
 Geneva, see the document below for the music system bid.  Call me and let's discuss.  kh 
 it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around. 
 contact Nova Guides in Minturn, Colo 970-827-4232  have fun!!!!!!!!!!
