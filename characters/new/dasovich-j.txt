terested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements.  We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition.  In exchange for joining the coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information.  I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc. However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead partner on the case.  I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case.  Because the majority of this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly fees.  However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition, and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all participants in the coalition.  With this discount, these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.  I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be.  Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates.  If you require some type of estimation sooner than that, please let me know.  Thank you for your interest in using our services.

 thanks again for hosting.  most kind of you, and we seemed to make a lot of progress.  did you get enough money for dinner? 
 Thanks.  Will do.  It's going to be a long haul. 
 Hi.  Nice to see you in Houston.  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points you circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the talk?  Finally, rest assured, you're the best resource anyone could hope for on gas issues anywhere in Enron.  If it seems like I've bugged you less recently it's because 1) I feel like I've bugged you a lot--too much--over the past couple of years and don't want to wear out my welcome and 2) with the electricity crisis in California and the start-up of Broadband, my attention has been less focused on gas.  Though that will change soon, since as you may have heard, PG&E's "Gas Accord" is coming to an end and we've got to figure out where to go from here.  (You'll be hearing from me in the near future on that issue, since I'll need to get a company-wide view of what we want to happen out here in the West.)  Look forward to seeing you again real soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  How you feeling these days?  From whom can I get copies of the following presentations?  2000 RB-NGC-0800-2 2000 JN-2080039-4  Thanks a billion. 
 thanks very much.  can you email me a copy of the OII?  let's get together for coffee sometime and discuss things.    "Cherry, Brian" <BKC7@pge.com> 11/07/2000 06:59 PM 
 Thanks.  Wow, can you believe only a week?  (I bet you can.)  I'll be thinking of you.  Best of luck.  Will miss you while you're out. 
 Thanks.  FYI:  I won't need accomodations.  I'll only be there for the day on Tuesday. 
 I've got an idea.  Howzabout Ted cooks and you clean up?  Seriously, though, I'll try to host next time at my humble apartment.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/09/2000 01:31 PM 
 Greetings Ms Carson:  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points that Shelly Corman circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the talk?  And are there any recent analyses by CERA, PIRA etc. about gas nationally, in the West, and in California that you could forward.  And if you get a chance, could you give a ring?  I've got a couple of questions.  As always, greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 gracias, jose. 
 I assume, since C1's stock rose 10 points yesterday, that you struck a deal with them! 
 you @ ferc?  if so, give kahn my best, and tell him we look forward to the flood of plants he'll approve next week.  peace will never change.  Jeff 
 you hearing this horseshit?  jeff 
 for the "JN" presentation, could you send me the one that Gil Muhl gave? Thanks a bunch. 
 the hard copy i have (it's from the "media binder" developed for our offsite at the Woodlands on 9.19.00) has the number JN-2080039.  it's from gil's presentation to the AGA on 9.19.00.  Thank, Jeff      Simon Shih 11/09/2000 02:21 PM 
 that's wierd.  i'm, of course, very bummed.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/09/2000 02:59 PM

 Could you please send me the number you gave me before for purposes of getting the check to you?  Thanks so much.  Jeff 
 Hi Ginger:  Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on Monday.  I'll be participating in the conference.  Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless)  "UC Regents" and send it to:  Heather Cameron Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy University of California 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA  94720   The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is:  946002123.  Thanks very much.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 So far, all is well.  Thanks for asking.  Best, Jeff 
 Mark: Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation.  Perhaps the administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a "placeholder" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to "fix" the mess that California refers to as a "market."  As such, there hasn't been much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control regulation.  However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports, which I'll forward in a seperate email.  I look forward to seeing Prof. Littlechild at the conference on Monday.  He's on the first panel, I'm on the second.  I've attached the URL for info on the conference.   http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  Best, Jeff 
 well, don't seem to be an electronic copy out there.  trying to get a hard copy.    Susan Scott 11/09/2000 09:41 AM

 FYI.  December 2000 HEADLINE: "Perfection in California" AUTHOR: Wilfred Wong SUMMARY: Recommended: 1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130) 
 darling.  please.  don't taunt me.  i'm now too flustered for words.  got your page and voicemail.  been wrapped up ALL day.  i'll try to call later.  give me your number again, please.    Colleen Silva <Csilva@redsky.com> 11/09/2000 03:34 PM 
 Margaret/Elizabeth:  Simon doesn't have Gil Muhl's presentation (job # I have is the "JN" one listed below).  Do either of you konw how I might get a copy?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff  P.S. Margaret.  Got your voicemail.  Thanks.  Will call you as soon as I'm able.    Elizabeth Linnell 11/09/2000 01:32 PM 
 FYI. 
 OK, the tours are booked (it ain't much anyway).  But you're on the guest list for a complimentary OPUS tasting (see previous note).  OPUS is across the street from and just south of the main Mondavi winery.  When you get there, check in with the concierge, who will have your name and will set up with the complimentary tasting.  It gets real crowded sometimes, which causes them to close the gates.  If that occurs, you simply need to buzz the intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up.  You should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a cool place.  Finally, they're open from 10:30-3:30.  Later it gets, crazier it gets.  I suggest you try to get there around 11:30, which will ensure that you get the attention you deserve.  Have a great time.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Greetings. I really encourage you folks to be in close contact with Robbi and company.  Please keep me tightly in the loop about any conversations, activities, etc.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Hopefully you mean "buy?" 
 John:  I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting. Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.  I apologize---you may have read in the papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.  It's taking up a considerable amount of my time these days.  I would be happy to reschedule for next week.  Wed-Fri.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 John:  We must thinking alike.  I just sent you a note.  I apologize, but I need to reschedule.  Monday and Tuesday of next week don't work, but Wed. thru Thurs. do.  Just let me know what works for you.  Again, my apologies, and I look forward to meeting next week.  Best, Jeff 
 Monday--Morning office; Afternoon--UC Berkeley participating in roundtable on California electricity crisis Tuesday--AB 1890 implementation group--presentation on gas issues in California Wed--In office Thurs--in office Fri--in office 
 Greetings:  Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC hearing that took place today.  We've been invited to attend.  Focus of hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather than FERC's.  Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.  Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California? Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee? ("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell group of people.")  If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST). Please let me know if this works for folks.  And if it does work, Ginger could you set up a call-in number?  Best, Jeff 
 This schedule is correct. 
 you're very welcome. 
 Greetings Diane:  Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying!  In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the head, I just wanted to say it's been great working with  you guys. Unbelievable....   In any case, congratulations.  Sounds like, all in all, it was a good meeting.   Scott:  has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet? 
 Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody.  Amen. 
 You have access to generation daily?  Just wondering if the guy wrote the story... 
 the feeling is quite mutual.  best, jeff    Donald Lassere@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/10/2000 12:08 PM 
 I apologize if I offended anyone.  Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large, regulated utility in  California.  Thanks for attributing the quote to me.  You did a great job at the hearing----it went decidely downhill after you left.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you for the note.  I'm very much looking forward to meeting you, and hope that you can visit the office while your hear to discuss California. How long will you be visiting?  Best, Jeff    "Stephen Littlechild" <littlechild@tanworth.mercianet.co.uk> 11/10/2000 12:27 PM 
 u going to w.palm beach to help christopher? 
 go for it.  not enough people fighting any good fights anymore.  instead, we get the likes davis and peace.  best of luck. 
 thank you very much.  i left a message on her voicemail.  that oughta do for now. 
 Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday. If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL: http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"  I've been asked to identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).  There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10 meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the "facilitator."  All comments are appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 You coming diving with me and Shea tomorrow?  You gotta do it, man. 
 i don't know the exact address.  it's between 15th and 16th, same side as the mission.

 Hey folks: Here's my rough cut at question #'s 1-4.  Let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Lately, my email's been mangling addresses when I reply.  Just noticed that I got alot of "couldn't send/big error" messages from the answers I emailed out late last nite.  Did anyone get them?  I'm trying again.  Please let me know if you get this one.  Thanks, and sorry about the mixup.  Best, Jeff 
 That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her. In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll look into setting up a meeting with her.  Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the "undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move ahead.  Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control Peace at her hearings.  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 11/12/2000 02:35 PM 
 Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be there in person.   Thoughts?  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 11/13/2000 08:16 AM 
 Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing something, please let me know.  Thoughts?    Harry Kingerski 11/13/2000 08:45 AM

 We said no. 
 sunday. 
 If Karen thinks it would be useful to have the PR firm go and report back, that's how we'll handle it.  Otherwise, we'll get reports from others.  Other commitments win out over FERC's "open mike."    Susan J Mara 11/13/2000 12:28 PM 
 Welcome Chris.  I can meet during the break. 
 Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday. Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far as to push the "core/noncore" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:  I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act as a "quasi-governmental" body offering reliable, low cost service to small customers. I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive market willy nilly. People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of the "good" power, leaving the "dregs" for small customers.  While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening that we should try to exploit.  In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the utility live or die by the benchmark.  There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the Legislature will get on board.

 Can we try Friday at 10 am, again?    John Protzel <John.Protzel@Cambira.com> 11/13/2000 05:58 PM 
 As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to. Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 11/13/2000 04:57 PM 
 Sorry that I've been incommunicado.  At the UC Berkeley conference yesterday, and on my way to an AB 1890 meeting to present on gas in about 5 minutes. Got your message re: PR firm.  Sounds good.  When I'm back in tomorrow, I'll fill you in on yesterday's conference and today's meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Dub and I are going to go to Stinson/Bolinas to seela the deal on Saturday morning/afternoon prior to going to Napa for Nancy's Bday on Sat night. Would love to have you two join, but worry not if you've got conflicts.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Sorry to bother you with this, but I'm travelling, and if you could leave the call-in number for tomorrow's meeting on my voice mail, I'll be forever indebted.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you very much for the summary. 
 Man, Illinois is tough.  One has to submit testimony to get certified!  How are things going?  Got your voice mail.  Hope all's well.  Recovered yet from the conventions? 
 call in number? 
 Glad to hear you're coming.  I'll be sure to wear the lime green shirt....  Best, Jeff    Richard Shapiro 11/14/2000 07:34 PM

 FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed electricity model created by AB 1980.
