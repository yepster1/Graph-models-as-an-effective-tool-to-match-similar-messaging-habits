ckage which lists all of the closing costs.. Am I too assume you are paying those directly and getting reimbursed by ENA or do I need to pay them myself? 6. Have you secured mortage financing for me ?  MONDAY morning is very important for you and I go hammer out final details. 
 No problem... !!!! Perhaps another time.

 Fran.... Kerri Rigsby from Associates will be contacting you regarding the Bridge Loan.  She needs a letter on file verifying that I will have these funds.  We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a cheque sent up to me in Canada so that I can consolidate with the rest of the funds required for closing.  Thanks. BT 
 Did I send this to you already ?
