 Some of these are cute! 
 Hi!  I sent a message to the above address - please let me know if I need to do anything additional.    Thank You! 
 Hi!  Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in place for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enron and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.     Thank you! 
 Hi!  I submitted the claim by mail earlier this week - this is the third claim in a row I have had to send more than once.  I have only submitted three in the last several years and have had problems with all of them.   Thanks for listening! 
 I resubmitted the claim by mail and have not heard anything  -  the service I have received from the customer service department in the last six months has been terrible - one delay after another  - lost claims.  It is very frustrating.  I will let you know when I get a response.   Thank you! 
 This is wonderful - thanks for the memories!  Love ya! 
 Beverly -  once again thanks so much for your help on this. 
 The deals should have been corrected in Sitara by now - if not please check with Beverly.  Thank You! 
 Hi!  The sitara deal # is 527410.  Hope this helps! 
 Sorry,   I changed the deal ticket to $10.50.    Thank You! 
 Thanks Victor! 
 Elizabeth,  Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices Altrade is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have found in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct and this is not a large amount in question.  Thank You! 
 Hi!  You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas! 
 To all,  If you would like to contribute towards a gift for Scott Neal and/or Kimberly Brown, please drop your contribution by my desk.  Would like to collect $20 for each but any amount would be appreciated.  I will take a check and would like to receive by Tuesday!  Thanks in advance! 
 Hi!  These sales to Torch are valid.  Accounting is going to correct.  If you do not see this happen soon - please let me know.    Thank You! 
 Hi!  Are we still on for dinner? 
 Hi!  Juniper is an Enron owned company that seeks and finds new wellhead production and sells it to ENA (in most cases).  The Koch Midstream gas  Joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into Tennessee Pipeline which is a East Desk Pipeline - I believe the Texas desk asked that we be respnsible for this volume.  I hope this helps!  Sorry it took so long to get  back to you! 
 Hi!  I gave his resume to Scott Neal.  He is going to look at it and pass it on to the appropriate people.  It looks like his backround includes more origination experience than trading.   Take care! 
 Thanks for the invite but we already have plans for the game.   Hope you have a good time and Nebraska wins! 
 Hi!  It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron. I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday season!  Take care!   Andy 
 This will make your day! 
 I think the kids would like this! 
 Thought you might like to see this! 
 Hi!  Sandra Brawner trades the Gas Daily Finantial products for the Gulf Coast.  She will be on vacation tomorrow and has asked me to run these products for her.  I need to be able to manage these products.  I can already manage the Henry Hub (Griff Gray set this up for me).  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help! 
 Hopefully this will cheer you ( just a little)! 
 Maybe this will help cheer you up - I know how much you love cats! 
 Hi!  I know your probably mad at me but I took vacation on Friday and could not get my husband interested in coming downtown ( I know your thinking yeah right)!  Scott said it was fun!  Just because I didn't make your party does not mean you are out of sight  -  out of mind!  I wish you much happiness and a very bright future.  Take care and come to see us often (we are still waiting).     Andy 
 Ignore my comment about being a one day deal!  Sorry! 
 Can you tell me anything more about the deal - date & price?  Hopefully I can help with additional information.  Is this a one day deal? 
 Hi!   How was your lunch with Dan?  I hope you had fun! Thanks for going with me to the YMCA - I can't wait untill we get into the routine we talked about. When do you want to start?  Next Monday?     Love You Much!!! 
 Hi!  How are you?  I wanted to call you this week-end but I had such a bad one that I never had time.  First, I made a mistake at work that caused several people to have to work extra time on Saturday so I was on the phone with them all day ( I felt bad).   Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos and I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.00 to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).  I was off Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (to nice for us actually).  We finally got our chandelier for the dining room - it is so beautiful.  I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Don told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn has to work.  I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla & Russ are not doing well.  Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just  you & me.  Well better go.  Love you and take care of yourself.

 Hi!  How is your day going?  Yesterday was better for me!  The vote for who did better in the debate last night seems to be Gore.     Love You! 
 Thanks so much - your the best! 
 Hi  I guess this is a case of be careful of what you ask for!  Since you helped me last week delete all products except physical gas from the All Products section of stack manager ,  I can no longer select a financial swap product as a link to my physical products.  For example, I would like to link my HEHUB physical rest of month product to the gas daily HEHUB swap product.  Can you help me once again or refer me to someone who can?  Sorry, I did not realize these options were connected.    Thanks in advance for your help! 
 I do not show I did any deals outside of EOL with Koch at the Sabine Hub during this time frame.  Sitara deal #369260 refers to EOL deal ID 369298. 
 I was told you may be the person to help me.   I am a trader on the East gas desk working for Scott Neal.  When I was originally set up to operate on EOL I  was set up with many more products than I needed.  I am having problems with my system being very slow and the suggestion was made to delete everything from All Products in stack manager but US Gas.  Are you the person who can help me accomplish this?  All other attempts to speed up the editing process have been unsuccessful.  Even if this does not help improve the time it takes to change a price I would still like to delete these product options because it takes me to long to find my products each day.      Thank You! 
 Please set me up for Thursday at 2:00.  THANK YOU! 
 Per our verbal conversation earlier today, Enron North America Corp. would be interested in selling gas under the following terms:   Volume:  400,000MMBtu during the month of August, 2000 and 800,000MMBtu during the first 10 days of September, 2000 Price:  Fixed price  as agreed by both parties at time of  request  by Duke for a firm price equal to the September NYMEX  +$.01 Delivery Point:  as agreed by both parties   Please call with questions and concerns.

 Hi!  Yes,  we were discussing your lending habits and everyone was calling me a fricken mouch!  Your like a legend around here. We still need to get together and share some of your previous comments with Craig.  How are you?  I miss you and get regular updates about how you are doing from you know who.  Been to any exciting ports lately.   Any baby news?  Not much new around here - John Craig keeps us laughing.  Take care!  Andy 
 Hi!  I'm so glad everything is going well with the kids - what is Jay going to study?  I am worried about Dani driving too - just don't tell me - there's no need for both of us to worry (just kidding).  When do they start back to school?  Some kids in Houston started this week already.  I so enjoy the summer when the traffic is lighter.  I have started getting to work earlier between 7:00 - 7:15 so that helps some.  Dick told me his brothers Charles & Russell and families are planning to come to Houston for Christmas - I started sweating immediately.  What will we do with all these teenagers & ANDREW?     Love you & take care of yourself! 
 How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Not much going on here - I think I'll go see the new movie with Richard Gere on Friday - wish you were here so we could go and sob together.  Drop me a line if you get a chance. Say HELLO to the kids!   Love you! 
 Please contact Kimberly Brown for all the details - she planned the party and took care of the final  charge to my account. 
 Hi!  You are correct as usual - the premium is +$.0125 for the time period May - July 2000.   Thanks for checking!

 Hi!  Your not going to believe this but I just opened your email from a month ago.  Apparently I had so many at one time I thought I was seeing them all  but I wasn't.  It is (was) so good to hear from you!  I'm sorry about all the problems PG&E has had but I hope it hasn't dampened your spirits to much.  It will all work out in the end.  Dick & I are still here.  We were not smart and only sold about a third of our Enron stock when the price was above eighty so we have just been riding it down.  I guess we will be here for awhile.  I'm glad you got your house done - that is such a good feeling. We only have a few things left to do inside.  Then we get to start on the backyard and patio.  It never ends!  We had a very mild winter and it is just starting to get warm - I'm already dreading the heat.  I hope you can find a place to do ceramics.  I used to go with my mom every Saturday when I lived in Omaha.  At first I just went to spend time with her but I ended up really enjoying it - very relaxing.  I was very slow - in the year I was there I only finished two projects.  I still display them proudly on the appropriate holiday.  Are you going home for Easter?  This Friday I am going to have nasal surgery - something I have been putting off for years.  I am not looking forward to it.  Once again this highly predictable market is moving so I better go!  Take care and I'll try to call you when I get back from R&R . Sorry it took so long to write! 
 Hi!  For some reason I can not open this file - could you please send me a hard copy to (713) 646-8453 fax.  Thank you! 
 Hi!  Do you still have all the notes I gave you on how we should break this out?  This is the deal from hell!  Thanks. 
 Hi!  CMS is correct - the price should be $8.74.   Thank You! 
 Hi!  I'm easy - any night works for me! 
 Hi Terri,  Sorry I missed your call!  I would love to get togerther this week sometime - any night will work for me - just let me know.    Thanks 
 Please include the following:  Andrea Nicks - Aquila Scott Garrison - Axia Pat Bergin - Axia Brian Rickers - Sempra Mark Chambers - Coral Ann Riopelle - Coral Ragan Bond - Bridgeline Chris Cokinos - Cokinos Kevin Cokinos - Cokinos Tim Riordan - Hess Duane Lawhorne - Williams Steve Jaques - Williams 
 Has unify been changed?  I thought you told me a couple of weeks ago that everything had been changed.  Please let me know - thanks! 
 This is incorrect.  I started in 1976 -  I believe in June.  Please recheck.  Thank You! 
 These are so cute! 
 I think I would be a "1". 
 Hi!  What group are you moving to?  Have you finally had enough of us?  I can't blame you!  Good luck & take care. 
 Hi!  Thanks - these were very good!  Take Care! 
 Hi! The sitara deal # is 1068979.  Thanks! 
 Hi! Thank you once again for all your sucessful efforts to renegotiate th= is deal.  It means so much to Enron and the physical desk. =20 =20 =20 
 Hi Susan,  I have not really been MIA just taking some time off.  I received an offer to trade for UBS which I have accepted. Our desk will be very small to start out.  Brad did not accept his offer and is moving to Kansas City to work for Aquila.  Pete quit before he was made an offer to work for a bank in New York City.  I am so happy for him.  All that is left are me, Scott, Judy (working full-time), Chuck, Sandra and Jon McKay.  Scott wants to trade all the points we were trading before so it should be interesting.  He is going to trade the Hub physical and financial.  Judy and I are going to split up everything else. Chuck is going to trade market area.  Frank Vickers, Jared and Craig are all that is left of origination.  Jared had a baby girl on Thursday.  Her name is Kendall Gill (do not know where the Gill came from)  and everyone is doing fine.How are you doing?   Andy 
 Yes - I received it last week. 
 Please call me back - I love you so much. 
 Please terminate any contributions to the United Way for 2001 & 2002.  Please call me at X35775 if you have any questions. 
 Hi!=20  Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vac= ation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of= us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading compa= ny.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the = company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  Th= is is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something= would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible t= hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on= I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit= h our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a trag= edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad= for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been r= etained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his jo= b will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is = going well for you and your family.  Take care! 
 Hi!  Sorry it took so long to respond but I took a couple of days off.  Tuesday is fine for dinner - looking forward to it.  It looks like UBS Warburg is our new owner.  We do not have any information yet from our management so I can't tell you any more about the structure of the company.  Hopefully I'll know more by Tuesday.  Let me know what time on Tuesday. Maybe we could eat somewhere closer to the loop since we only work until around 3:00 right now and you are out that way and Cindy has to go that way. 
 Corrected price - sorry for the confusion! 
 Hi Steve,  I spoke to Jeff Hodge this morning. Jeff asked that I provide to you the pipeline contracts we will need to put into place for the East Trading desk as soon as possible after  we find out who is going to buy us.  As expected the pipelines would only provide us will shell sgreements but we would like to get a step ahead by having legal review them so we can hopefully turn them around quickly when credit is established with the new entity.  You should receive them this afternoon.  I am at X35775.  Thank you! 
 Hi!  Count me in!   Thanks 
 The sitara number for November is 1143838 but you probably know by now - sorry for the delay. 
 Per our verbal discussion of Friday January 4, I requested 2000MMBtu/d of storage gas for the period January 5-7 to serve an existing market on Florida Pipeline. Ragan Bond at Bridgeline informed me that my request would be denied.  ENA needed to purchase pre-paid gas from Sequent to fulfill the market's request for additional supplies.  ENA did not attempt to schedule the delivery of gas out of storage after Bridgeline informed me they would not perform on our request because we would have needed to request the customer to submitt a nomination for a delivery that would not be confirmed.  Please let me know if you need additional information concerning this transaction. 
 Hi Aunt Mary and Uncle Bob,  Sorry it has taken me so long to write.  Life is not good here at Enron.  I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold.  I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format.  Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people.  It was so sad the day they let all those people go.  I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job.  Dick's company has basically been shut down.  He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business.  His job will eventually end but we have no time frame.  I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation.  We had sold all our Enron stock in our 401K some time ago so we have done ok. It is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays.  Please tell them hello and MERRY CHRISTMAS.  It sounds like everyone is doing well.  Michele is disappointed we are not coming home for Christmas but Dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible.  He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working.  I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing.  Take care.  All our love.  P.S.  Next time I write I promise to be more upbeat. 
 Hi!  It is so nice to hear from you!  I am trying not to think of all that is going on here - but it is not fun.  Seeing you next week,  however, will be. Would you have any free time to go to lunch or dinner maybe on Wednesday?  Let me know - sorry for the delay in responding I just opened your note. 
 Hi!  Yes,  we were discussing your lending habits and everyone was calling me a fricken mouch!  Your like a legend around here.

 Some of these are cute! 
 Hi!  I sent a message to the above address - please let me know if I need to do anything additional.    Thank You! 
 Hi!  Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in place for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enron and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.     Thank you! 
 Hi!  I submitted the claim by mail earlier this week - this is the third claim in a row I have had to send more than once.  I have only submitted three in the last several years and have had problems with all of them.   Thanks for listening! 
 I resubmitted the claim by mail and have not heard anything  -  the service I have received from the customer service department in the last six months has been terrible - one delay after another  - lost claims.  It is very frustrating.  I will let you know when I get a response.   Thank you! 
 This is wonderful - thanks for the memories!  Love ya! 
 Beverly -  once again thanks so much for your help on this. 
 The deals should have been corrected in Sitara by now - if not please check with Beverly.  Thank You! 
 Hi!  The sitara deal # is 527410.  Hope this helps! 
 Elizabeth,  Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices Altrade is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have found in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct and this is not a large amount in question.   Thank You! 
 Sorry,   I changed the deal ticket to $10.50.    Thank You! 
 Thanks Victor! 
 Hi!  You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas! 
 To all,  If you would like to contribute towards a gift for Scott Neal and/or Kimberly Brown, please drop your contribution by my desk.  Would like to collect $20 for each but any amount would be appreciated.  I will take a check and would like to receive by Tuesday!  Thanks in advance! 
 Hi!  These sales to Torch are valid.  Accounting is going to correct.  If you do not see this happen soon - please let me know.    Thank You! 
 Hi!  Are we still on for dinner? 
 Hi!  Juniper is an Enron owned company that seeks and finds new wellhead production and sells it to ENA (in most cases).  The Koch Midstream gas  Joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into Tennessee Pipeline which is a East Desk Pipeline - I believe the Texas desk asked that we be respnsible for this volume.  I hope this helps!  Sorry it took so long to get  back to you! 
 Hi!  I gave his resume to Scott Neal.  He is going to look at it and pass it on to the appropriate people.  It looks like his backround includes more origination experience than trading.   Take care! 
 Thanks for the invite but we already have plans for the game.   Hope you have a good time and Nebraska wins! 
 Hi!  It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron. I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday season!  Take care!   Andy 
 This will make your day! 
 I think the kids would like this! 
 Thought you might like to see this!
