 This is 80% true.  You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF: ? 1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids. 2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name. 3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata. 4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children. 5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer. 6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight. 7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing. 8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting. 9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra. 10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice. 11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready. 12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!" 13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid. 14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00." 15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped. 16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party. 17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool. 18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes. 19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake. 20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake. 21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior. 22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box. 23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy. 24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby. 25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party. ? Power to la Raza ? I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........  ?

 Rich, tell me this meeting is work related.  I say this because I have limited passes each month.  Let me know, I hope its work related. 
 Yes it was Laura.  Sorry for the inconvience. 
 SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.  OPC was also a hig 30's bid much of the afternoon.  We managed to sell SOCO 200 mws for 2 hours until TLR's ended the sale.  -For Sunday SOCO was a low 20' bid in the morning and in the afternoon was a low 30's bid.  Duke was seller  in the mid 30's all day.  SCEG was also an hourly seller, unfortunately SCEG was limited to where they could go.  DUKE and VEPCO will have hourly to sell for Monday.   FRCC-For Saturday Florida was a seller due to rains over much of the state. FPL was offering 60's much of the day.  They were a big seller to SOCO much of Saturday.  -For Sunday things were a little different.  FPL was a bid in the low 60's for the afternoon peak.  By afternoon time TLR's prevented any power from going into Florida.   ERCOT- For Saturday an afternoon schedule traded for $75 and after this went through ERCOT prices went up.  WE sold $75  to Reliant for HE 16.  For HE 17-19 no power was to be found in ERCOT.  HLP was $100 bid for these hours. TU would not show us bid for these hours.  -For Sunday power was offered out at $55 with no bids(low 30's bids).  No transmission avail. for HE 14-19 going up to the North. 
 GRETCHEN  I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SOUTHEAST HEDGE BOOK IN DEAL BLOTTER.  THE GTC TRANS. HAS NOT BEEN ENTERED/ROUTED IN ENPOWER. 
 SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00. SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the North could not flow to SERC.  Off-peak bids for Saturday were in the low teens.  SOCO was an $11 bid for off-peak.  Everyone else in SERC was flat or a low teen bid.  For Sunday SOCO was a $26 bid during the afternoon peak. SCEG was a $34 bid.  TLR's prevented any deals getting done with SCEG during the afternoon.  DUKE, SCEG and SOSO will be on the bid for Monday.  FRCC-   For Saturday we sold power to Florida in the morning but were cut due to TLR's starting HE11.  Bids in Florida got to as high as mid 60's.  FPL and FPC were the one's bidding in the mid 60's.  TLR's were not lifted until H/E 1, for H/E 1 we sold FPL $22(100mw's) into JEA.  For Sunday FP&L and TALL were both on the BID @ $26-35 Hourly in the morning and  BOD @ $ 55-65.00. Sunday morning we began buying  power from CE  and selling it to FPL and TALL.  TLR's were called startng H/E 11.  Florida was bidding in the mid 40's for a 16-hour schedule for Monday.    Offpeak bids were in the mid teens for both Saturday and Sunday night.  ERCOT-  For Saturday bids were in the low to mid 30's.  Offers were in the high 40's(CSW and HLP) to mid 50's(TU).  We sold the City of GARLAND $54 for he 23 and 24.  Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these hours. 
 FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12. For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35. DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the $35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.

 SERC  A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and SCEG will be on the bid.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5    FRCC  Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought $21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a decision on any b.o.d preschedules.  FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 68.8  OFFER $ 139.7 
 Jeff, I fax the ecar hourly price index again for the 19th.  I did forget to put "attn:  bobette" on the fax to her. 
 TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m. We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units. VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them $24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have hourly to sell tomorrow.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 43.9  OFFER $ 60.2   FRCC  After the preschedule we sold FPC through he 19,  FPC was a $50 bid.   FPL would not show a bid for he 20.  FPL was a $70 offer beginning he 21.  FPL was the only offer for across the evening peak.  FPL showed $140 for he 20. FPL began  selling $60-$70 to SOCO for he 21-22.  Off-peak was the same as yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules. 
 SERC  Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics. SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 50  OFFER $ 80   FRCC  Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait until mid morning to look for preschedules.   FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 90  OFFER $ 150 
 hey, baby you are the only person who e-mails anything!  i have the dental forms, can you take them to the dentist tomorrow if you get a chance, thanks!! 
 FRCC  For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours. For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    SERC  TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's. We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO $45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA starting in the afternoon. 
 Ginger, here is the information you requested.  Cherie D. Hernandez 07-30-70 465-47-0999 
 Kerri, here is the information you have requested.  Cherie D. Hernandez 465-47-0999 
 ECAR  Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday.    MAIN  Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only bid for a preschedule in Main. 
 ECAR  There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most utilities will be sellers in the morning.  ECAR   FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 25.6   OFFER $ 27.5 SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.5   OFFER $ 26.9 SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $  9.9  OFFER $ 17.2   MAIN  TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in picking up a preschedule.   MAIN  FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 19.7   OFFER $ 30.4 SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.1   OFFER $ 20.7 SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $ 9.4   OFFER $ 15.7

 Hey guys and gals our problems with pjm #'s has been cleared up at last.  A spreadsheet has been set-up to give us pjm #'s.  Its located in M:/ELECTRIC/24HR/NIGHTSHIFTDATA/PJMHOURLY.  The northeast guys will import their numbers into this spreadsheet everyday before they leave.  Our group will be responsible for the evening hours.  Please keep track of these when you come in to work the evening shift.  This procedure is temporary until the northeast guys start their 24 hour desk.

 This is 80% true.  You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:  1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids. 2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name. 3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata. 4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children. 5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer. 6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight. 7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing. 8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting. 9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra. 10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice. 11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready. 12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!" 13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid. 14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00." 15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped. 16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party. 17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool. 18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes. 19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake. 20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake. 21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior. 22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box. 23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy. 24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby. 25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.  Power to la Raza  I thought this was something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........

 ECAR  There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most utilities will be sellers in the morning.  ECAR   FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 25.6   OFFER $ 27.5 SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.5   OFFER $ 26.9 SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $  9.9  OFFER $ 17.2   MAIN  TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in picking up a preschedule.   MAIN  FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 19.7   OFFER $ 30.4 SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.1   OFFER $ 20.7 SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $ 9.4   OFFER $ 15.7 
 ECAR  Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday.    MAIN  Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only bid for a preschedule in Main. 
 Kerri, here is the information you have requested.  Cherie D. Hernandez 465-47-0999 
 Ginger, here is the information you requested.  Cherie D. Hernandez 07-30-70 465-47-0999 
 FRCC  For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours. For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    SERC  TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's. We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO $45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA starting in the afternoon. 
 HERE ARE MY ACCOMPLISMENTS FROM JUNE OF 2000. I HAVE TRACKED AT LEAST 40,000 DOCUMENTS IN THE TAGG DEAL CLEARING DATABASE.     THIS INCLUDES GAS, POWER, AND SITARA DOCUMENTS. I SEPERATE AND DISTRIBUTE ALL INCOMING PAPER FROM OUR INCOMING PRINTER.                   I HAVE FAXED OUT AT LEAST 5,000 LIQUIDS DOCUMENTS AND M-DEAL DOCUMENTS. I HAVE ENTERED AT LEAST 5,000 DOCUMENTS INTO THE LIVELINK DATABASE. I HAVE ASSISSTED THE RESEARCH OF VARIOUS LISTS OF GAS AND POWER DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO UPDATE THE STATUS OF THESE DOCUMENTS. I HAVE ALSO TRAINED FOUR EMPLOYEES IN THE VARIOUS DATABASES SUCH AS TAGG, DECAF II, LIVELINK, ASCENT, AND ENCOPY, AND ALSO TRAINING OF USING OUR FAX MACHINES. 
 hey, baby you are the only person who e-mails anything!  i have the dental forms, can you take them to the dentist tomorrow if you get a chance, thanks!! 
 SERC  Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics. SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 50  OFFER $ 80   FRCC  Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait until mid morning to look for preschedules.   FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 90  OFFER $ 150 
 TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m. We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units. VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them $24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have hourly to sell tomorrow.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 43.9  OFFER $ 60.2   FRCC  After the preschedule we sold FPC through he 19,  FPC was a $50 bid.   FPL would not show a bid for he 20.  FPL was a $70 offer beginning he 21.  FPL was the only offer for across the evening peak.  FPL showed $140 for he 20. FPL began  selling $60-$70 to SOCO for he 21-22.  Off-peak was the same as yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules. 
 Jeff, I fax the ecar hourly price index again for the 19th.  I did forget to put "attn:  bobette" on the fax to her. 
 SERC  A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and SCEG will be on the bid.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5    FRCC  Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought $21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a decision on any b.o.d preschedules.  FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 68.8  OFFER $ 139.7

 FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12. For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35. DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.

 SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00. SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the North could not flow to SERC.  Off-peak bids for Saturday were in the low teens.  SOCO was an $11 bid for off-peak.  Everyone else in SERC was flat or a low teen bid.  For Sunday SOCO was a $26 bid during the afternoon peak. SCEG was a $34 bid.  TLR's prevented any deals getting done with SCEG during the afternoon.  DUKE, SCEG and SOSO will be on the bid for Monday.

Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these hours.

 SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.

 Yes it was Laura.  Sorry for the inconvience. 
 Rich, tell me this meeting is work related.  I say this because I have limited passes each month.  Let me know, I hope its work related. 
 I'll call in tomorrow to get the time and place.

 Please e-mail the policies that you consider too conservative.  If these issues affect your own personel life, then you have big problems.  Just keep in mind that your family lineage is very conservative.  And please remember that I supported G.W. "frat boy" Bush. 
 That's no problem.  With 2 kids we like to catch up on our sleep during the weekend.  Nicolas was one of our finalist  for Alex.

 This is 80% true.  You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF: ? 1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids. 2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name. 3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata. 4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children. 5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer. 6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight. 7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing. 8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting. 9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra. 10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice. 11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready. 12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!" 13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid. 14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00." 15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped. 16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party. 17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool. 18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes. 19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake. 20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake. 21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior. 22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box. 23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy. 24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby. 25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party. ? Power to la Raza ? I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........  ?
