 I will be running the power options desk with UBS. I will still be trading gas though. how about you ? 
 This looks good. what were the system vols and when can you get me the rest ? 
 We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement. If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement. 
 same plan 
 cool go for it. 
 close enough for 5 9's, no ? 
 no interest. 
 I know Steve Murray quite well. 
 Add Barrick Gold to your list. They like Enron, and Bruce Garner has had extensive discussions with them. 
 what would be the product the Sabre would list ? I like the name but can't see the business idea; help me out. 
 where are we at with them ? 
 Please work with the group so that I am no longer inundated with erequests for additional mailbox space. 
 andy zipper john lavorato dutch quigley larry may mike maggi 
   how does this relate to what we are working on with them ? 
 When will we have a draft available fo distribution to Accenture ? 
 Unfortunately I will not be attending, but I would like to participate via videocon. 
 This is my simplistic first take: 
 Bloomberg has come back to the table with us and are being good boys so far. So I don't have a problem issuing them a EnronOnline journalist ID to view your prices. Thanks for the cooperation.  Andy 
 1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.  2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.  3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.  4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.  5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.  6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.  7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.  8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7). 
 I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.  I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.  A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline. $150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.  I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.  Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.  I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy. 
 Congratulations !  Now let's focus on closing the deal and getting someone else signed up.  Well done all.  AZ 
 huh ? 
 700 NM, 4 hrs total 
 Earthsat requires a password for enron, what is it ? 
 1). Reuters will give us 75% of all subscription revenue, which is how the product is sold. This is on a monthly or yearly basis.  2). Lynne T. Jones ASID phone: 281-437-3307 pager: 713-833-0736  good luck. 
 Let's you and I get together for lunch today, and do the same with Brad tomorrow. 
 I will be participating by videocon. 
  This is where we are with banks for fx product hosting on EOL. 
 please put greg piper, phillipe bibi, and greg whalley on  distribtuion list.  Thanks 
  I have had you added to distribution list. 
 Sounds kind of vague to me. I think we should stick to known publications who we think add value. 
 In case you guys didn't have a copy. 
 done. 
 I can get in but I have no access to gas messageboard. Can you please fix.  Thanks 
 have we heard back ? 
 Jorg,  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are. I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail. I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...  A big Mazel Tov on the engagement ! Married life is the way to go.  I heard about Sonny. Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.  I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.  Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994  AZ 
 Ras,  This looks fine. Please distribute to Accenture.  Thanks, AZ 
  open up attached word doc. that should cover it. thanks. 
 would you like me to fill it out and return it to you ? 
 sorry for the delay I will have my check tomorrow. 
 John,  We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.  We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.  Revenue expectations:  Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.  thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;  With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.  This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.  If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.  AZ 
 Can I get a Reuters screen as well ? 
 I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.  1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.  2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.  3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.  4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.  If anyone has any questions about this let me know.  AZ 
 Still does not work. 
 please... 
 Next steps are he gets me a contract for the API, and lets me know when they are meeting on mid and back. 
 Let's table this for now. Too much going on.  On another note: Where do we stand with TFS ? 
 Heard you had ended up at Allegheny. In NYC or Hagerstown MD ?  Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.  Hope all is well.  Andy 
 Arvind, The propoer contact at Enron for you is Jay Webb. He can be reached at jay.webb@enron.com. I will foward this to him.  Good Luck, Andy Zipper 
  Over to you. 
 dave forster. 
 I need this deal closed by month end. 
 why are we bothering with LOC, I thought we had moved past that ? 
 Why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform ? This provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time, no ? 
 Please remove me from your contact list. Thank You. 
 Not enough of a background in finance. Thanks and keep trying. 
 Stewart,  It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.  Andy Zipper Enron Networks 
 Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !  On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.  On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.  Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?  Hope all is well  Andy 
 Please check with me prior to traveling to conferences.  Thanks 
 my work phone is 713 853 6994 
 I think this guy would be a good fit for RAC. Send the resume to them. 
 FYI 
 I've asked Bob to be the business side representative to work with Operations and IT in getting the Kiodex project off the ground. In addition he will be pursuing the channel partner opportunities with them regarding Product and Environment hosting services. On the sales channnel effort he will work closely with Dave Forster. 
 looks good. what are vector's major receipt and delivery points ? 
 Naveen,  I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.  1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%  2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%  3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%  4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap  5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap  6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap  7). Same for Nov02/Mar03  8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02  9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap  10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle  If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.  Any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Andy 
 Claudio,  I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?  Thanks Andy 
 jeff said he does not have access to trade emissions allowances. if he indeed does not, please turn him on for those. if he does, let me know. thanks. 
 I understand; however my request stands. I would like a heads up whenever you are planning a trip like this, it is the same I ask of all my direct reports.  Thanks 
 John, On the first note: OK, thanks.  On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills. You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.  Thanks, AZ 
 I realize that traveling to see a client is part of our job. I would just ask that we try to spend those expense dollars as efficiently and conscientiously as possible.  Thanks, AZ 
 Mike's thoughts on subject... 
 What is, exactly, the state of play here ? I nothing else happens, on Monday does the product go up on the wallboard ? Has Eddie quoted on px to the Merc ? I need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between Whalley ,Arnold and Lavorato. 
 Thanks, are we talking to GreatLakes pipepline as well ? 
 do we have a contract in front of them yet ? 
 Harry's comments. He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue. 
 Why is Mr. Frank Alexander interested intalking to me ? Furthermore who is he ? 
  Greg and Philippe  Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:  1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.  2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.   Recommendation:  EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.  Thanks, AZ 
 Yes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench. If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going. 
 I talked with Greg and he and bibi are for it. Start the process with Guadaramma but keep it close to the vest as it is not official with the DealBench folks. 
 thanks. 
 Wasn't me. 
 Do we want to make this official ? 
    Give Raj a call.  --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 I do not want my name in the article. Please use Greg Piper's or Phillipe Bibi's.  Thanks 
 Thanks for the note. Awaiting your review and response.  Andy Zipper 
 I keep getting asked for a username,password and domain name. What do I put in these fields to get access ? 
 Kenny, Peggy, Mike,  We would definitely like to get this finished by end of June. We can move as fast as you need us to. Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences. How does this work for you guys ?  Thanks AZ 
 My pleasure. 
 Claudio,  I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want.  My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.  questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.  Regards, Andy 
 You're right he does look good. I am very interested. Can you set up a phone interview, and if that goes well bring him down for rounds. 
 Stu,  When you get a chance can you gice me a call re: the above and Natsource. I'm around most of tomrrow so any old time is fine with me.  Thanks Andy 
 thanks. 
 I agree. The whole thing is a sham. 
  FYI 
 any help you can give us would be appreciated. thanks. 
 Thank you. 
 Eddie,  Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.  Andy 
 Stewart,  I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal "can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? "  The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.  For what it is worth.   Andy 
 I agree completely. We are the delivery vehicle for Kiodex. 
 I hear Shell.... 
 I got this from ICE. Thought you should have a look at it.  AZ 
 Hi ! thanks for message. I will try to call you on cell phone.  Love you mucho,  KPD 
 I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying. 
 I sold 2,000/d of apr/oct @ 3.19, and 2,000/d @ 3.18. Please put these in the ng-opt book, not the jv book.  Thanks 
 Jay, Thanks for the help.  Andy 
 It has the  hO numbers but not the Cl numbers. 
 Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Thanks Andy 
 Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.  I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying. Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...  How is yor flying going ? 
 Congratulations on the new job !  Good luck, Andy 
 Sanjeev  to be honest this looks a little to convoluted to me. a nov/mar peiod for weather versus a jan-feb-mar basis ? I pass on this.  andy 
 After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.  Just thought you would like to know. 
 sure 
 let me know when you want to talk.... 
 I sld 500/d of cy03 2 3.56. pls book this in the JV book. thx. 
 i bot 1,000/d at 3.175 apr/oct02. put it against the digital in gas-x.  thanks 
 That would be great. 
 I'm okay. How are you ? 
 I am attending the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) clinic at Adams Field in Little Rock. This is the big airport in Little Rock. The clinic will be run at Central Flying Service, phone number there is 800-888-5387. If you need to speak with someone from the clinic ask for Kathy Tatalovich who is the administrator. I will be staying at the Embassy Suites by the airport. I don't have the nuber now but I will call you with it.  I'll call you from the road.  Love you and the kids mucho, KPD

  Small issue but annoying:  If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit "set" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.  Hope all is well otherwise,  Andy

 Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as "shaken but all right" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome. "Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now," said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour. "And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria." Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

 1). Nov 1yr  close: 2.77 reset swap px: 2.70 resets to: 3.10 reset trigger: 3.15   2). Nov 2yr  close: 3.00 reset swap px: 2.90 resets to 3.35 reset trigger: 3.35   The mechanics of the swap are as follows:  It is a normal swap at the reset swap price unless a particular reference month settles at or above the reset trigger. In that case that month and only that month's reference price resets to the new price as specified in "resets to." all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again.

 how about 3:15 in front of plaza java ? 
 i asked ina rangel to send it to you. 
 sure. what time ? 
 Dave,  Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know.  Regards, Andy 
 I think it relates to Paul not getting the top job in their soon to be spun off unregulated unit. That job went to some guy named Shockley who Eric Vanderwald will report to. Their press release makes for fun reading. 
 Don't know if you saw it, but your friend and mine Paul Addis is leaving AEP to "pursue other interests".

 In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. ``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''

 GLENDALE, CA- Rock guitarist Steve Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday. "His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked," said Jimmy Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry. "He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow." The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani "showed off a few licks" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah. 
 Let's do it.Sorry I didn't get the messages but lets's have dinner next tuesday if that works for you. 
 no problem. they seem okay so far. 
 Monica,  Things are a little bit unsettled right now. I am working on them and will have something shortly. Your patience is appreciated.  Andy Zipper 
 Can I please get an NG run asap. Thanks. 
 Thanks, I think I am okay, but let's talk tonight. 
   Enron does not place NYMEX position limits on its desks instead using overall VAR limits. If a desk is authorized to trade a particular instrument, such as a NYMEX contract or swap, the size of that position is governed by the VAR it generates.

 Hate to pile on but I think KM is circling the drain here. I told your mom a couple of weeks ago that there is high probablility they file chpt 11 by end of first quarter. Get out while you can. Hope boarding went well for you and you didn't break anything.  Andy 
 Spoke with Rick Stuckey who advised me that a group of seven of them will be arriving today. They would like to heave specific discussions regarding the Pro forma as well as EnronOnline technology starting monday morning. Rick also adivsed me that they are amending the original term sheet that they disucssed with Greg Saturday night.  I will keep you posted. 
 Robert, Here are the two messages from "Jeff Lawson" and the response I got from Jeff Sprecher at the ICE regarding my complaint. I appreciate your handling this matter.  Andy  --------- Inline attachment follows ---------

 I'm sorry, I did not get it. Thnigs have taken an interesting turn here, give me a call. 
 yes. 
 Eddie,  Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.  Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family, your friend Andy 
  I received this, this morning. I know you are busy right now with other things but I would really like this thing to stop. 
  Dave, This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.  Andy Zipper 
 Dave,  I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.  Andy 
 I don't know if Bob hillier talked to you yet, but I need Stack and Option manager set up on a stand alone machine. I am moving to the power options group as of tomorrow.  My cell is 713 419 0203. Call with questions. 
 Work for me. 
   --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 i'm considering this terminated. 
 I would be happy to, and yes you may use my name. 
 Rick,  I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it.  For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:  Average tenor: 5 months  Average trades per day: 400  average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu  average px: $2.7/mmbtu  With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7  You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.  That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).  The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.  As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?  Andy

 Have not called doctor, but will soon.  Love you siempre, KPD 
 Given the fact that we still have a significant number of transactions that are not captured on EOL, my answer would be thanks but no thanks.  AZ 
 I dont' know and I don't know. 
 Bruce Peterson at Korn Ferry International. He runs the energy practice out of Houston. They are located in houston, but I don't have his phone number. Information should have it. He is a good guy and very well connected.

 I'm ok. Things are pretty bleak. I don't know what is going to happen. Asking myself some serious questions about my career. 
 I think Enron and my career are finished. 
 John, Thanks for the note. Yeah things look pretty lousy here at the big E. From first to worst in 4 easy weeks. The untold story is how much money the gas and power trading folks have made that some weenies in three piece in suits in Corp pissed away. Looks like we are going to be bought by Dynegy. Hang in there with ONE. I am agitating for a Christmas visit to Mich by us, so hope to see you then.  Keep on it, Andy

 Can you believe it ? cat sleeping with dogs.... 
 Greg,  I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:  1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)  2). I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.  I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.  Good luck, Andy 
 There is a lot of confused bullshit floating around..... 
 Mooney's are great planes and are very fast. I almost bought an MSE a few years ago, which subsequently was called the Allegro, then the Eagle. They are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever. Drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward. They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy. Idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing.  AZ 
 Errol pleae make sure to put anything not mentioned by Justin into my book. Thanks. 
 wow, three weeks away from the kids ! brave and lucky man. life is very edgy here waiting for this stupid auction to happen. i don't really know what things will look like after even if we do get a bidder who wants to go foward. stay tuned. have a good time in oz.  andy 
 what about crude straddles ? 
 We should be watching this... 
 I can take this mission. Please advise.  Andy Zipper

 Jay,  Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night. I think this might have to do with orders getting wiped out duirng maintenance but I wanted to alert you to this.  AZ 
 I asked Steve and here is what he sent me. 
 FYI 
  got this from late friday. have you ever heard of him ? 
 Thanks for the note. Let's talk real soon. 
 Thanks. 
 thanks. good luck.

 A friend who works in New York asked if I could recommend an attorney who does Will/Estate preparation. Do you have any recommendations ?  Thanks, Andy  p.s. Happy New Year !! 
 Let me check on it and get back to you. I had mine done in Houston, but I can probably recommend someone.  Happy New Year, Andy 
 Thanks !  Have a safe and happy New Year.  Andy 
 who are you ? 
 I got it, whatever it was. 
 Sorry to see the absorption of TQ by APB. I suppose it is all for the best.  Hope that you guys come out of it allright. The irony is that TQ outlived Enron ! Haven't spoken to you in a awhile and hope that all is well with you and your family. Call me when you get a chance to catch up.  Best Regards for the Holiday Season, Andy Zipper 
 See you soon. Will do on the duds. 
 in Detroit @ 313 881 1166  Happy Holidays, Andy 
 In detroit @ 313 881 1166  Happy Holidays, Andy 
 huh ? 
 Mari,  I will be out Monday thru Wednesday. I will be in from 10:00am Thrus thru Friday.  My cell is (713) 419 0203. I will be reachable @ (313) 881 1166 through Wednesday.  Happy Holidays, Andy Zipper 
 no thank you. 
 no problem. good luck. 
 Will do, brother. 
   Ted, Try these guys. George is excellent. I don't know much about Balal. Hope all is going well for you and your bride. I know I owe you a phone call, and I will pay the debt soon.  Best, Andy   --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 I think the note I sent to Steve plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough. We will not support the app. It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information. As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than "gee, wouldn't this be cool" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project. I'm going to ask Dave Forster to do that.  Comments ?  AZ 
 Let's let Govt. Affairs get some more info before doing anything.

  Stranger than fiction.... 
   <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)> 
 let's discuss. 
 Talk to Matt Motsinger for that information. He is in charge of the reporting for that. 
 If we accept, then yes our IPE shares get converted to ICE shares. 
 yadda yadda yadda.... 
 the c1 guy's note is just more e-commerce blather...I don't know whether he would add any value or not, but would definitely add buzzwords. 
 Arvind,  Thank you for the note. We are evaluating the potential value that Techspan could bring to Enron. We will contact you when are ready to enter into a dialogue. Once again thank you for your interest in Enron.  Andy Zipper Vice President

 no interest. thanks. 
 ok 
 I don't know. 
 I need to meet with GM from 12:30 to 2:00, so the early offsite slot works for me. Thanks. 
 Can you schedule and send out the following note to the EnronOnline origination group:  "Please attend an origination meeting on Tuesday, May 29  from 8:30 to 10:00. The focus of this meeting will doing a walkthrough of an EnronOnline demo for both EnronOnline hosted products and X-online hosted environments. This demo will cover all relevant functionality of the system, similar to what we have been presenting to GM et al."  Send to:  Dave Forster Michael Bridges Bob Shults Dan Diamond Jake Staffel John Allario John Pavetto Mike Haney Leonardo Pacheco Carl Carter  cc:Greg Piper, Mark Palmer 
 Okay. It wil be Bob Shults. I will put him in contact with Joe. 
  Please call Joe Robertson of enron Metals in NY to discuss market-making deal with the COMEX. 
  this is the underlying deal. it needs work and i am not sure we would do it. also, no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals. 
 I AGREE WITH KAL. 
 I believe the attached note accurately summarizes our position. We do not see anything changing. The deal remains terminated for the reasons below. 
 I declined to review Drew because I feel I haven't really spent a lot of time with him. The times I have worked with him, he has done a great job and been easy to work with. 
 Let me make this clear: Accenture is not to speak to anyone other than ourselves regarding what they are doing with EnronOnline. We ahve too much at stake right now.  Thanks AZ 
 Who and why ? 
 Yes, and I would you and I to chime in as well. 
 Vin,  Glad we could hook up yesterday.  The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.  Thanks, Andy Zipper Vice President Enron Corp. 
  Please review the spreadsheet, and look at Daily Deals Graph. 
 Justin, The traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.  Thanks, Andy 
 Lara, You need to be the master user for the platform. It is EWS policy. Go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with Justin. 
 Guys, Let's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.  I'm good from 11:00 to 1:00  Andy 
 thanks. damned things never work. 
 millionth trade: eric graff @ Coral, TCO pool day gas, someone on scott neal's desk. 
 OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile. 
 Frank,  Thank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.  Andy Zipper 
 I've seen it before. It is Hong Kong Airport and the guy kicked out the crab at the last possible second. He was seconds from riping the gear off. 
 Mike,  That's fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline's concurrence. If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go. Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.  Thanks, Andy Zipper 
 We will do on Monday morning, but I don't think we need Jay involved. 
  Kal will be finishing mine shortly. Please be prepar
