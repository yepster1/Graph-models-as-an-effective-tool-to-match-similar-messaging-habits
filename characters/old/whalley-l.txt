 Greg Whalley has rented out the Rooftop Deck & Clubhouse at Union Station for Opening Game on Friday, April 7.  You are cordially invited to party with Greg "the Green Hornet" Whalley, with game time beginning @ 7:05p.m. - Astros vs. PHI.  Please contact me about the numbers of tickets you will need.  We may be able to accommodate some members of your team.    The rooftop can hold up to 75 people.  Many Thanks,   Liz Taylor x31935 
 Okay "Superman" how many tickets can you really use?  "Buffy - The Vampire Slayer" 
 Sure thing partner.  I'm giving Reck 8 tickets for the coal desk.  Liz 
 this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way to satisfying all constituents. 
 Yes, we watch the game from the rooftop.  You can also with your pass go into the stadium.  Liz 
 Kristin,  Per Greg Whalley, we need to install the Executive Report Viewer on Dave Delainey's computer.  He should have access to everything that Whalley has. Approval, for now, will remain with Whalley.  Greg would like this taken care of ASAP.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 see you then 
 just thought i would send you this link to see if we could both connect to this site and talk to each other 
 not to worry,  we'll see 80s within 3 weeks 
 Please extend badge #21771 through this week.  Liz Taylor Executive Assistant Office of the Chairman Enron North America 
 Jeff,  I will sponsor you in the amount of $957.23 in the MS 150.   The Green Hornet 
 Jim,  Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.  Please advise.  Liz 
 lets talk again before too long.  there is a lot going on. 
 you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan. 
 sounds like a good idea 
 Dave,  Fred Lagrasta came through for us on the tickets.  He'll deliver four to me on tomorrow.  Liz x31935

 just some thoughts on what we might say in a letter if we have to send one by the 4th. 
  Enron North America Corp. 
 don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.  i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing power plants anywhere.  Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our fundamental analysis of the region. Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week. 
 call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.  greg

 Mr. Bodily,  I was able to speak w/Greg this morning and I regret to inform you that he will not be able to join your class via video conference on April 3rd as we had previously hoped.  Greg will have to leave Houston for some of our overseas offices beginning April 2nd for approx. two weeks (London, Tokyo & Sydney).  I do apologize for the short notice, but these things tend to happen quickly, and with little or no notice.  Please provide me with some possible future dates during the month of May and I will discuss them with Greg.  Liz Taylor Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley 
 Thanks,  Cindy,  Can you copy me  also.  Greg does not check his emails regularly.  Thanks,  Liz 
 thanks for seeing him 
 Christie,  Greg has a conf. on his calendar during the period of May 9.  Let me check w/him to see if he really plans on attending the conf.  Liz 
 do we know the categories and nominees? 
 Do you have it now? 
 Christie,  Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could work out fine, it that's not too late.  Liz 
 would you have any interest? 
 Hi Richard,  Per my voicemail, are you available for at least an hour to meet w/Greg Whalley while he is in London?  He is wide open on Thursday.  Please advise.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor - E.A. to Greg Whalley 
 i'm certainly not opposed to training, but how does a weakly written review lead to an age discrimination claim? 
 here we go ............... 
 does it get any uglier than this? 
 call mark tawney.  we do occasionally make markets in precipitation. 
 Okay 
 the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a big plane. 
 Johnny,  What does Greg owe you for the champagne?  Is it $896.00?   Liz 
 what do you think?  why don't you give him a call 
 Per your reqest..... 
 Angela,  Greg is looking over everything.  I'll get back w/you later today.  We will probably have two to three slides.  Liz 
 i cant open this 
 Cathy,  Will Shankman be able to attend that one?  Liz 
 I have actually talked with these guys before.  More than a year ago I think.  I may have an old copy of their business plan.  The guy I talked to was Frank Levy, their CEO.  Just out of curiosity I would like to talk to them again to see if they have anything going.

 just saw that Louis Dreyfus traded with us today.  good job!!  one concern though -- several of the new names that we see coming across show up for 1 trade and then don't come back. are we getting any feedback from them on the WTI product??  it can't just be the size.

 i didn't do it !!!! 
 does this mean that you are a seller at 70% of the number you put in your retail column??  If so....  i will take  PJ Fluer Dom La Grande Dame  the cristal looks a little pricey @ 200,  but @ 140 i'll take that too. 
 i assumed it was intentional, but wanted to make sure.  for the moment it works, but if our volumes continue to rise, we need to move to absolute numbers 
 You're e-mailing me on Greg's address book.  It's because I responded to your first address from his e-mail and I thought I was in my address book.  Honey,  please feel better soon.  I'm saying a prayer for you right now.  I'm glad I put a smile on your face (and what a handsome face it is).    Liz 
 He asked me to table it til this week.  Last week was full of activities planning for the Analyst conference and tons of meetings about our problems in CA (Power).  Sorry you're not feeling well.  Take care of yourself.    I had a lovely weekend, thank you.  Edmond and I did dinner & dancing on Saturday night.  We had a picnic @ Allen Parkway on yesterday afternoon.  Followed by a  Super Bowl party for two.  This was a lot of fun.  We ate junk food and drank cokes all night.  By 3:30a.m. this morning we both had a stomach ache.  Am I sharing enough, to much?  I think I like me old way better.  Going forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine."  Liz 
 Good Morning Ken,  Good weekend?  liz 
 if the good catch you are talking about was the profitability assumptions being doubled, i didn't catch it.  Pavel did. 
 Pd = change in price V = volume per transaction S = bid/offer spread T = number of transactions   Profit =  T*V*S/4  -  V*(P2)/S?? 
 Robert,  I have on Greg's calendar the dates of Jan. 10 - 12 for Bonus & LTI Reviews w/you.  You booked this w/me a couple of months ago.  This has probably changed and should be removed from Greg's calendar.  Please advise.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 it is his job to talk.  he can't help himself. 
 your volume comparison chart is off by a factor of 10.  each contract is 1000 bbls. 
 Rebecca & Kelly,  For future correspondence, please also copy me on emails to Greg Whalley.  I check emails more frequently than Greg.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 D'Arcy, please call me tomorrow morning to get on the calendar.  It's best in the future to copy me on all emails to Whalley for a faster response.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 if i could only get IN the club, instead of being a mascot.

  Subject: Whalley's Budget Meeting  Date:  Tuesday, June 12  Time:  11:00 a.m. CST  Location: EB32C2   Please notify me only if you are unable to attend.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor x31935 
 i would be happy to meet with him, but i need to know exactly when because my september schedule is pretty ugly.  we have talked with rappaport about their eNymex project, but they do seem to be struggling for strategy.  it is really surprising that they lost money.  how did it happen?  volume couldn't have been down, given all the volatility. 
 it might be a reasonable idea, as long as it isn't a weekly event 
 Mr. Nimocks,  Greg has decided that he would like to do the 90-minute panel.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 what do you know about this company?  i can get a meeting with the CEO.  they recently bought APL stacktrain unit to become fully intermodal.  i also think they are moving toward IPO. 
 Iain,  First, thank you for being so helpful with me on the phone.  Below is the information you requested for the Whalley home fax machine.  I would love to meet w/you to discuss an updated fax machine for Greg's at home office.   Greg & Mary Whalley 11110 Claymore Street Houston, TX  77024  (Memorial/Voss area off Hedwidg) HM#713-465-1641  The repair person can come any time tomorrow, Wednesday, 8/30.  However, a.m. works better for Mary Whalley.  Please give me a call when the rep. is scheduled to go out.  The machine is jamming and eating paper.  HP Office Jet Model #45W - MAX 50-60HZ 
 i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out? 
 Mr. Nimocks,  Greg has committed to participate in the conference.  Give me until end-of-day tomorrow, for a format preference.  Many Thanks,  Liz

 Deborah,  When I met last w/you, Bill, and others, it was stated that Fastow's group was scheduled to move off floor 27 the weekend of 8/25.  I have just heard that they are not moving off until 9/8?  Is this the case?  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 i have kept in touch with Gildea and Brechbuhl.  i didn't really know Eckberg very well.  Powell is now an FCC commissioner, though i haven't kept in touch with him either.  i don't know if you remember james conforti, but i recently saw gildea and brechbuhl at his wedding in february.  give me a call when you get a chance.  my extension is 35220.  greg 
 Brad,  You're scheduled to meet  w/Greg on Wednesday at 3:30p.m. in EB2801b.  It was great seeing you and welcome back!  Liz 
 yes i am.  are you working here at enron? 
 your talking to the wrong person.   Liz actually controls the tickets.  take them if they are available, but i won't be able to go.  how long are you going to be in houston? 
 we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team. he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward your message to him.  thanks for the heads up  greg 
 just thought i'd send this your way. 
 sorry about that,  i forgot that the options are held in that book.  i dont have any questions.

 Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit. Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

 Jessica,  Am I outstanding an expense reimb. from you?  I seemed to be approx. $6000.00 past due and I have my check from the trading floor.  Please advise.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 Mr. Bodily,  I was able to speak w/Greg this morning and I regret to inform you that he will not be able to join your class via video conference on April 3rd as we had previously hoped.  Greg will have to leave Houston for some of our overseas offices beginning April 2nd for approx. two weeks (London, Tokyo & Sydney).  I do apologize for the short notice, but these things tend to happen quickly, and with little or no notice.  Please provide me with some possible future dates during the month of May and I will discuss them with Greg.  Liz Taylor Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley 
 Thanks,  Cindy,  Can you copy me  also.  Greg does not check his emails regularly.  Thanks,  Liz 
 thanks for seeing him 
 Christie,  Greg has a conf. on his calendar during the period of May 9.  Let me check w/him to see if he really plans on attending the conf.  Liz 
 do we know the categories and nominees? 
 Do you have it now? 
 Christie,  Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could work out fine, it that's not too late.  Liz 
 Fernley,  Per my voicemail, are you available to meet w/Greg Whalley on Thursday, June 5 for about an hour?  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 i'm certainly not opposed to training, but how does a weakly written review lead to an age discrimination claim? 
 here we go ............... 
 does it get any uglier than this? 
 call mark tawney.  we do occasionally make markets in precipitation. 
 Okay 
 the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a big plane. 
 Johnny,  What does Greg owe you for the champagne?  Is it $896.00?   Liz 
 what do you think?  why don't you give him a call 
 Per your reqest..... 
 Angela,  Greg is looking over everything.  I'll get back w/you later today.  We will probably have two to three slides.  Liz 
 call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.  greg 
 i cant open this 
 Cathy,  Will Shankman be able to attend that one?  Liz 
 I have actually talked with these guys before.  More than a year ago I think.  I may have an old copy of their business plan.  The guy I talked to was Frank Levy, their CEO.  Just out of curiosity I would like to talk to them again to see if they have anything going. 
 went to the rodeo 
 Greg Whalley has requested weekly budget meetings during the month of March. The meetings are scheduled for every Tuesday @ 3:00 p.m. in EB3321, for one hour, beginning March 6 and ending March 27.  Please advise if your executive can not attend.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 Hi Chris,  Greg is located at EB3324.  He is scheduled to be in Monday - Thursday (Thursday til midday).  Liz Taylor 
 You & Your Spouse are cordially invited to join me at the 2001 Houston Livestock & Rodeo on Monday, 26th February  with performances by Brooks & Dunn Event start time:  7:00 p.m.  Please RSVP to Liz Taylor (x31935) 
 John,  How do you want me to handle pmt back to Greg for your return leg on Travel Air from the Super Bowl.  Greg mentioned that Enron may be picking up the bill for you.  If yes, just advise and I'll do up the payment request.  The total charges are $3,621.50.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 just saw that Louis Dreyfus traded with us today.  good job!!  one concern though -- several of the new names that we see coming across show up for 1 trade and then don't come back. are we getting any feedback from them on the WTI product??  it can't just be the size. 
 don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.  i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing power plants anywhere.  Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our fundamental analysis of the region. Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week. 
 Chuck,  This is a read-only file.  I'm unable to print it out to show to Greg. Please provide me with a hard copy.  Greg doesn't read e-mail regularly.  I keep an eye on this e-mail and print out things that require his immediate attention.  You may want to deliver me hard copies of the P&Ls.  Liz 
 Sure thing.  Liz 
 Hi John,  Have you sent Greg Enron Europe's 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to 4 each)?  If not, he needs them asap.  I'll also check through his emails to see if you sent them already.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 Dave,  Greg is requesting Enron Americas' 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to 4 each) asap.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor x31935 
 Rebecca,  Greg is requesting Enron Global Assets' 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to 4 each) asap.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor x31935

 Louise,  Greg is requesting Enron Net Works' 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to 4 each) asap.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor x31935 
 Mike,  Greg is requesting Enron Global Markets' 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to 4 each) asap.   Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 i didn't do it !!!! 
 does this mean that you are a seller at 70% of the number you put in your retail column??  If so....  i will take  PJ Fluer Dom La Grande Dame  the cristal looks a little pricey @ 200,  but @ 140 i'll take that too. 
 by this ratio the rest ot the power group is really underperforming!!!! 
 You're e-mailing me on Greg's address book.  It's because I responded to your first address from his e-mail and I thought I was in my address book.  Honey,  please feel better soon.  I'm saying a prayer for you right now.  I'm glad I put a smile on your face (and what a handsome face it is).    Liz 
 He asked me to table it til this week.  Last week was full of activities planning for the Analyst conference and tons of meetings about our problems in CA (Power).  Sorry you're not feeling well.  Take care of yourself.    I had a lovely weekend, thank you.  Edmond and I did dinner & dancing on Saturday night.  We had a picnic @ Allen Parkway on yesterday afternoon.  Followed by a  Super Bowl party for two.  This was a lot of fun.  We ate junk food and drank cokes all night.  By 3:30a.m. this morning we both had a stomach ache.  Am I sharing enough, to much?  I think I like me old way better.  Going forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine."  Liz 
 Good Morning Ken,  Good weekend?  liz 
 if the good catch you are talking about was the profitability assumptions being doubled, i didn't catch it.  Pavel did. 
 Pd = change in price V = volume per transaction S = bid/offer spread T = number of transactions   Profit =  T*V*S/4  -  V*(P2)/S?? 
 Robert,  I have on Greg's calendar the dates of Jan. 10 - 12 for Bonus & LTI Reviews w/you.  You booked this w/me a couple of months ago.  This has probably changed and should be removed from Greg's calendar.  Please advise.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 where are you right now?  i am in london.  are you around? 
 it is his job to talk.  he can't help himself. 
 you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan. 
 this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way to satisfying all constituents. 
 i have a question on my p&l.  how did the hedge book make money on change in price when it was long and the market went down? 
 I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.  As I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to contact him next week.  Greg 
 sorry about that,  i forgot that the options are held in that book.  i dont have any questions.

 would you have any interest? 
 how did my august position change?  i didn't trade any august today. 
 Sorry I took so long to respond, but if they are still interested, I would like to learn more about it. 
 Rebecca & Kelly,  For future correspondence, please also copy me on emails to Greg Whalley.  I check emails more frequently than Greg.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 D'Arcy, please call me tomorrow morning to get on the calendar.  It's best in the future to copy me on all emails to Whalley for a faster response.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 if i could only get IN the club, instead of being a mascot. 
 do you want me to mail a check, or what? 
 Mr. Piazze,  I'm Liz Taylor, Greg Whalley's Admin. Assistant.  We have spoken a few times in the past.  I have just a few questions concerning the event on December 13:   When in the evening will Greg give his speech? Who long is he scheduled to speak? Are you wanting him to have a slide presentation or just talk?  He promises to be entertaining (smile).  He really is a greater speaker, if I may say so. What is the dress code?   Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 I'll try to give you a call tomorrow 
 yes, we might be interested.  can we talk next week? 
 i don't know if you've heard yet.  maybe you should talk to lavorato.  my debt is currently trading at about 60-80 cents on the dollar. 
 Dan,  You and Greg are dining w/Greg Brady, President of I2 & Mark Skoda, CEO of Freight Matrix @ 7:00p.m. tomorrow night.  McCormick & Schmick's Seafood (713-840-7900) 1151 Uptown Park Blvd (between San Felipe & 610 Loop - Galleria Area) Reservation under: Whalley     Liz

 you can laugh at me later for building this.  in the meantime, maybe you can use it. 
 have your lawyer call ours.  we probably need to test this position in court.  we need to set a benchmark for others who may be in this position. 
 Beth,  The mail room just dropped off your package about 30 minutes.  Liz Assistant to Greg Whalley 
 yes it does.  how have you been?  have the electricity shortages made it to Stanford? 
 heard a rumor that EIX may file for bankruptcy on wednesday. 
 Please launch the attached Holiday Party Announcement.  Online invitations to follow in a couple of weeks. 
 good idea.  i'll bring it up. 
 Please cancel Greg Whalley for the Exec. Impact & Influence Seminar for November 6 & 7.  Liz Taylor x31935 
 Charlene,  Which dates are the Super Saturday weekends for Associates?  I'm trying to= =20 get Whalley committed for an Associate Super Saturday.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 Jessica,  Please confirm w/Rosie when the polycoms and lucent phones will arrive in the conference room for floor 27.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 Thank you very much!  Liz 
 Hi Bob,  I'll be sure to print your note out to Greg.  I have a couple of Enron folks wanting to come tomorrow.  Do you have two tickets left?  Liz 
 Marcela,  I emailed you a couple of days ago asking for the Tail # for the plane the Whalley's will be returning on Sunday.  Could you please furnish me with this information.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 One more favor.  I'm arranging for a car to collect Greg & Mary Whalley on Sunday, Oct. 15.  Can you give me the tail # of that plane?  It helps the driver so very much.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 Marcela,  I faxed it this morning.  Have you still not received?  Liz 
 They do look tight.  But after a $2 drop, you'd have to expect it to pinch. Seems like, unless things really fall out of bed, this spread should widen from here.  Even if the front stays relatively unchanged. 
 You didn't include the form in your email below.  Please do and I'll take care of it.  Liz Taylor 
 i'm sorry that i did not call you on friday with my credit card number to secure this charter.  i will call in the morning. 
 Rick,  I was able to speak w/Greg and Mike McConnell on your Napa Valley conference.  Unfortunately, Greg nor Mike are able to attend.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 Don,  Greg would love to see you.  What about lunch on the 13th?  (He's in PRC all day on the 12th)  Lets say 11:30a.m.   We're located at EB2801.  Take Care,  Liz 
 i would be happy to meet with him, but i need to know exactly when because my september schedule is pretty ugly.  we have talked with rappaport about their eNymex project, but they do seem to be struggling for strategy.  it is really surprising that they lost money.  how did it happen?  volume couldn't have been down, given all the volatility. 
 Sounds like a good idea to me 
 it might be a reasonable idea, as long as it isn't a weekly event 
 Mr. Nimocks,  Greg has decided that he would like to do the 90-minute panel.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 what do you know about this company?  i can get a meeting with the CEO.  they recently bought APL stacktrain unit to become fully intermodal.  i also think they are moving toward IPO. 
 Iain,  First, thank you for being so helpful with me on the phone.  Below is the information you requested for the Whalley home fax machine.  I would love to meet w/you to discuss an updated fax machine for Greg's at home office.   Greg & Mary Whalley 11110 Claymore Street Houston, TX  77024  (Memorial/Voss area off Hedwidg) HM#713-465-1641  The repair person can come any time tomorrow, Wednesday, 8/30.  However, a.m. works better for Mary Whalley.  Please give me a call when the rep. is scheduled to go out.  The machine is jamming and eating paper.  HP Office Jet Model #45W - MAX 50-60HZ 
 i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out? 
 Mr. Nimocks,  Greg has committed to participate in the conference.  Give me until end-of-day tomorrow, for a format preference.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 Robert,  We are diligently trying to increase our United Way participation. Currently, Net Works is only at 57% participation.  Listed below are employees in your department who have not gone online to make their pledge.  I'm asking you to personally all each of them today, and encourage them to make their pledge.

Thank You,  Greg  Cards Not Returned Amanda K Curless Cecilia Hankamer David Davies Debi K Vanwey Jennifer Richard Kathy McKay Laura Lara Mark Cruz Norma Yeverino Philip Conn Rebecca Quintana 
 George,  My Assistant, Liz Taylor, is the United Way Coordinator for Enron Net Works. Your group is listed with Net Works' United Way campaign.  Our participation numbers are very low.  We started yesterday with our telephone and personal visit campaign.  Liz has listed below the employees, she believes, belong to your organization.  These are the names of those employees who have not gone online to make their pledge.  Please have your Assistant verify this list. If they are indeed your employees, I'm asking you to personally call them and ask them to go online and make their pledge.  If any of the names listed below are not with your group, please have your assistant notify Liz.  Should they experience difficulties getting online, please call Liz @ 31935.   UnitedWay.Enron.com.

 on my current trip request #382 it looks like someone is bidding it as a one way trip instead of a round trip.  can you check? 
 Mr. Nimocks,  How long are you wanting Greg to speak?  What's the format for the presentations?  Will there be a Q& A after the presentation?  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.  The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.  Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO position. 
 Mr. Nimocks,  I don't know if you have spoken w/Greg as of yet.  However, I do know he is= =20 trying very hard to work this into his schedule.  I'll get w/him again=20 tomorrow morning for an answer.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley
