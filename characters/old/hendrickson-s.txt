 Connie ---  Where's my morning email?  I don't have anything to entertain me this morning.  Scott 
 No, I didn't see my mom for Mother's Day because they left early Sunday morning to go to New England for about 10 days.  So, I'm glad that they feel okay to travel!  We'll do something after they get back to celebrate both my birthday and Mother's Day.  My weekend was fine.  I didn't do anything exciting....didn't really feel like going out.  I did run both days and am starting back at the gym today so I can become superbuff.  I've lost 6 lbs during this whole thing at least.  Just 9 more lbs to my goal of 140.  I saw Rayfael Friday when he came over to bring me a birthday present (he didn't think I was home!)  Then I took him some stuff that was at my house yesterday and we hung out a little bit.  I'm still hoping there's a chance we can get back together, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  He definitely needs some time to himself and to get over this bout of depression.  I just hope that if he does, then he wants to get back together then, but I'm not sure he does.  We'll see.  I'm not interested in seeing anyone else right away, so I guess I can afford to give it a little time.  Can you put a spell on him?  hehehe  Of course, if we do get back together, that's bad news for the puppies.  If it did come to that, though, I would take them to doggie daycare during the day and they could stay outside at night - that wouldn't be so bad and they wouldn't be lonely.  Anyway, that's a BIG IF that I really shouldn't be concentrating on...so there.  How are things in Germany?  How was your trip to London?  I saw Heather in the elevator here last week, but I didn't get a chance to talk to her.  Write back!!!  Scott 
 Thanks!  I'm doing a tiny bit better today I think.  Probably won't be my most exciting birthday ever, though!  Yeah, I wish you were here to take me shopping too!  At least now, I have some time to do some of those little projects around the house that have been stacking up :).  Scott 
 Well, I think for now that he's not wanting to be in a serious relationship.  I don't think he ever really did, but we just ended up having one.  But I think he's got alot of other stuff going on in his life now with job and friends and feels that he can't be committed to a relationship and knows he's not going to make the effort.  I don't know if that will change anytime soon or not.  I'm assuming it won't, but hoping it will.  Anyway, I'm just super-depressed now and my birthday is tomorrow!  This will not be a birthday to remember.  :(  I really wasn't ready for our relationship to end, and didn't think it was about to, really.  So, I have to deal with the shock as well as the sadness.  I'm going to talk to him tonight about a couple of things, but if nothing is different today, I guess we'll just leave each other alone for a while and see what happens.  Scott 
 Mike ---  Did you get set up on AOL instant messenger yet?  If so, what's your screen name?  I'm scotth1965.  I've got several of my usual trading partners on there and it works out pretty well.  Scott 
 Darla -  Contact is:  Ricky Hart 3800 New Hampshire Ave NW Suite 405 Washington, DC 20011-7930 877-637-6270 
 I hope it's not really over, but i think it is, at least for now.  I'm very, very sad.  I don't want to be at work, but I might as well be here and depressed and somewhat busy, rather than at home and depressed with nothing to divert my attention.  At least the doggies still love me!  Scott 
 you must not have got my second message....rayfael and i broke up last night :(  unrelated to dog situation....  scott 
 http://www.fitnessheaven.com/resources/workouts/myworkout/ 
 Now the dog issue isn't a problem...me and Rayfael broke up last night.  :( 
 Any news on whether you can make it for the weekend of Jun 22?  I now it's way past my turn to go there, but the show will be better in Houston that weekend!  Also, what about the Aladdin...did you get comped?  Scott 
 I'm so sad!!!  Mr. Bean and Greta are going to have to move outside.  Rayfael's allergies just can't take them, even if I relegate them to the downstairs bedroom and outside.  It's like he's building up an immunity to the allergy medicine.  He's just miserable anytime he's at the house - obviously, that doesn't help a relationship.  So, starting tonight (?) they are going to move outside.  I'm gonna have to get them one or two (probably one) doghouse.  I'm so depressed about the whole thing.  Rayfael feels bad too, but it's important he not be near death anytime we're together.  He feels like the bad guy.  And I feel like a bad father!!!  I can't bear to think of their cute little faces staring in the french doors wondering what they did wrong!  I'm getting paid back for all the nasty things I said about Barbara Dillard and her dogs!!!  I want  you to move back and let Mr. Bean and Greta live with you and Angus!!!  Nextdoor!!!  (the house is still for sale! - $269,000 list now, down from $314,000).  So, will you come back and be my doggies' mommy?  Armin can come, too.  Write back!  Scott 
 Dutch ---  I need to cancel a deal where East-CNG sold 10,000 Jun NX at 4.20.  It was a limit order that EOL never recognized, but during all that turmoil, somehow got executed, about 30-40 minutes later.  Scott 
 Hey Eric ---  How are things?  How is the job?  Is this still the best email address for you?  What's your work phone?  Things are fine here.  Same old same old.  Scott 
 I dunno what's going on there...the board gave approval to pull out of the deal, but I think that was just a threat.  I think we must be staying in the deal.  But our stock price is not so great right now.  There was an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE article about Enron in Bloomberg Markets magazine.  It basically said we were a house of cards and lied about all our earnings expectations from new businesses.  It was very unflattering.  That came out yesterday, I think.  If I could find it in an electronic format, I'd send it to you, but I only have it on paper....  Enjoy your sun!  It's been pretty rainy and nasty here the last few days, but that's good for the yard.  Don't forget that my birthday is Friday!  I need a present from you!!!  hehehe  Scott 
 Sheila - there should be an offsetting deal to this #662479.  The net effect is that Vineyard should pay us the differential of $0.05 on 37,373 MMBtu or $1,868.65.  Scott 
 John -  Do you have a problem customer????  Scott 
 Yeah, I remember everything in London being VERY expensive!!!  But I had a great time there, I'm ready to go back!  I wanted to take Rayfael there this summer, but I doubt that will happen now.  It's starting to get pretty hot....hitting 90 now.  YUK.  I wish I'd started running sooner while it was cooler....I'm trying to get back to 140, and I'm 8 1/2 lbs from my goal.  I'm going to have to get buff now that I'm on the market again - and partially to make Rayfael think twice!!!  heheh  Oops...I started typing this email two hours ago and got too busy to finish...I'll send this now and write more later...  Scott

 Hey ---  FYI, Dan Junek quit today....he's going to Allegheny Power in NYC.  Thought you'd be interested to know.  Also, Kim's brother-in-law died this week.  They aren't exactly sure what the cause of death is yet.  So you may wanna contact her and give her your condolences.  Not much going on here, except I'm losing money hand over fist!!!  Talk to you later....  Scott 
 you are correct sir!  scott

 Joann ---  Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and update it daily?  Scott 
 Molly,  I'd love to go, but I have guests in town this weekend, so won't be able to make it.  Thanks for the invite, though!  And tell Chris Happy Birthday....  Scott 
 good thing they only shake your HAND!!!  hehehehe

Scott 
 OH, that's too bad!!!  Are you feeling better now?  I guess the drugs are wearing off!  I was really looking forward to dinner tonight, too.  I had a bad night last night.  But, you may want to avoid sushi altogether until you've been remedicated.  I hope you have a better trip back!  Scott 
 Bobby....i'ts 10:35 am...do you know where Kim is?  I'm trying to get in touch w/her and let her know that my mom's appt. got moved up.   She was going to go, but we can't get in touch w/her.  Scott 
 i understand it perfectly!!!  it's saying the following:  I'm sorry to hear about your empoyer's relatives....it sounds like that Connie woman is really evil!  I hope she doesn't hit you anymore.  I do agree that you should put a spell on her.  In the meantime, I will think bad thoughts about her.  It's paraphrased, but you get the gist of it....  hehehe

 Ok, kids ---  We SOLD flex CNG Flex deals to El Paso (opposite of this month) for May.  The sitara deals are as follows:  737642 - ENA buys 5,000/d baseload from El Paso at CNG SP for Index flat. 737647 - ENA sells 0-15,500/d to El Paso at CNG SP for Index plus $0.055.  El Paso must take 155,000 for the month.  737645 - ENA buys 5,000/d baseload from El Paso at CNG SP for Index flat. 737655 - ENA sells 0-15,500/d to El Paso at CNG SP for Index plus $0.065.  El Paso must take 155,000 for the month.   On deals # 737647 and 737655 (we sell to El Paso), the volume is in as a baseload of 5,000/d but the expected volume is zero on May 1-21, and 15,500 on May 22-31.  CHRIS - make sure we keep up with this on the morning sheet and that the volume is zeroed out in the system until they actually call on it.  They will have to call us by 9:30 am to take the gas on any day.  Scott 
 yes, it should be dominion south point gdpa....sorry  scott 
 Oh well, the stock price is still going up!  http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010417/n17603037_2.html 
 So, what does that mean for last weekend?  Any love?  Scott 
 well, keep me informed of that little issue....  scott 
 good boy! 
 So did you get comped on the room/meals?  If not, what's my share of Elements and Commander's Palace.  I ended up about $300 in the money, a little less than the hotel room.  I didn't try to get comped because I know I didn't gamble enough.  But let me know how they treated you...  Scott 
 I'm assuming that's the law suit related to your former employer?  Sorry to hear about the hand that rocks the cradle!!!  So have you found a new nanny?  I REALLY REALLY REALLY need a vacation soon, so we should talk!  Vegas could be "in the cards" by late July or August, but maybe we can do something prior to that even...I've had sort of a bad last couple of months....we can get into that in more detail later.  So, do you like the new job?  How's Ethan doing?  Any non-psycho love interests?  Scott

 Well, sounds like everything is great in Germany!  You still didn't tell me about your trip to London?  I'm still doing just "ok".  The busier I am, the better I am, so I'm trying to keep as busy as possible.  If I wasn't poor and worried about my JOB right now, I'd schedule a trip to come see you, but I have to see how things shake out here.  I need to make some money quick!!!  And yesterday didn't help!  I need a vacation!!!  You guys MUST come stay with me at some point while you're here, and I wanna have a party one night while you're here.

 But I'm super busy in the mornings trading, so I can't write much....I can barely even catch my breath in the mornings!!!  Especially today because I just turned my alarm off for some reason this morning rather than getting up when it went off.  So, I woke up later and made it to work in like 15 minutes....showered, shaved, clothed and all.  But I'm not quite all here.  I had my front door refinished yesterday (which it REALLY needed - and it looks great now!), and I think the fumes all went upstairs to my bedroom and gave me brain damage and made me want to sleep!  I promise I'll write more in a bit after trading slows down....  Scott 
 Scott ---  I put this together to sort of summarize our activity to date on New England points.  As you can see, the volumes are moving up pretty steadily and we're at least getting a presence up there - with no assets, virtually no transport.  At the same time, we've taken pretty minimal risk.  Also of note, we are getting alot more calls for multiple month pricing on these points as well.  Please see attached spreadsheet....    Scott 
 FYI ---  They are opening a Freebird World Burrito here next to that Le Peep that we've eaten at - across from 59 Diner.  Jealous much?  Scott 
 Don't worry, your reward will come in heaven!

 That sounds great!  So will they get it all spread in one day?  Sounds like everything is taking shape now!!!  Not much going on here.  I had dinner with Rayfael last night, it was a little painful, but I survived.  He's so messed up in the head right now.  :(  Anyway, nothing too exciting happening here....at least nothing that's gonna cheer you up...  Scott 
 Good luck with the grass!  I can't even get my little yard covered.  Yeah, I'm open to going out with new people.  Just not really pursuing it just yet.  Depends on how long before I really feel the need :).  Actually, I'm more interested in just making some new friends right now.  I've decided I need a few gay friends to hang out with.  That will get me out meeting more people for other stuff too.  Yeah, mom and dad got back over the weekend.  They had a good time, sounds like they did nothing but shop!  She's been going to MD Anderson for a while now.  In fact they did bloodwork yesterday and she goes in to see the doctor today.  Anyway, that's the scoop from this side of the Atlantic....  Scott

 Guten Morgen!!!  How was your weekend?  We had the long Memorial Day weekend here....hahaha!  Things are fine here.  I just tried to relax this weekend.  Friday night I = went to a movie with Rayfael. We saw Angel Eyes with Jennifer Lopez.  It wa= s pretty good.  Saturday, I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the= day.  Julie and I went to lunch and ran errands.  I went running every day= this weekend, too!  I've lost 10 lbs since the big breakup!!!  Down to 145= now, may go for 140 - not sure.  I didn't go out on Saturday because I was= just in a mood to stay in.  Sunday, I took care of some stuff around the h= ouse.  I wasn't really planning to go out, but one of my new friends, Kevin= , called and wanted me to meet him and some other folks out at a bar, so I = went at about 9:00.  Well, you know how 1 or 2 drinks always turns into alo= t more...I ended up staying there pretty late and having a good time.  I cr= ashed at Kevin's house and got back to mine at about 7:00 am.  So all the w= ork I'd done on getting caught up on sleep was ruined!!!  I came home and g= ot right in bed, but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much.  I went ov= er to Julie's yesterday to get instructions on taking care of her cats this= week.  She leaves Wednesday for Prague and gets back next Thursday.  Now it's back to work, but it's a short week at least.  I'm getting more an= d more used to the fact that I'm single now, and even though I'd like me an= d Rayfael to get back together - it's nothing I'm gonna be able to push, if= it happens, it happens.  I really hope it does, but the best thing for me = is not to push it.  So, in the meantime, I guess I'm a free agent!  That fe= els weird...but, oh well.  Anyway, how are things there?  Scott

 I don't know if you got my email, I sent it to the office.  Here's what it said in case....  "Connie --  Actually, they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected.  They were sad, but not horrified or anything.  They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.  I'm very happy to have it off my chest.  Sorry to hear about your stomach!!!  That doesn't sound fun at all.  I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.  Scott"  So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.  Hard to say whether it was good or bad for my mom.  But, honesty is the best policy, right?  Scott

 Well, sounds like everything is great in Germany!  You still didn't tell me about your trip to London?  I'm still doing just "ok".  The busier I am, the better I am, so I'm trying to keep as busy as possible.  If I wasn't poor and worried about my JOB right now, I'd schedule a trip to co
