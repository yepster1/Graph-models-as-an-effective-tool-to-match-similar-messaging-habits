 Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what "suggestions" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.  So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something different? 
 got it, thanks.

 Thanks.  Dad has had problems digesting food lately.  It just gets stuck in there.  So Sasha took him to the hospital.  They used tubes to remove some of the food that has been stuck, but they are not sure what types of treatment they will do now.  I will keep you guys posted.  Eric

 I sold the 10 MW off peak to STEC.  Enpower 796442.  I thought the length was in the Asset book, but it appeared that the lenth was in the Ercot Mngmnt book.  So I put the sale in that book to keep everyone flat.  I did not make any other changes to Enpower.  Eric

 Hey there,  Hope everything is going well.  I have some bad news.  In case you have not heard, my Dad passed on a week ago Sunday.  I was in LA for Adnan's wedding when my brother called.  Drove up to SF Sunday night, funeral was Monday afternoon.  I stayed in SF for a couple days, but there wasn't much I needed to do.  My brother is and will be taking care of paperwork and my Dad's apt and stuff like that.  So I drove back down to LA and stayed there for a couple days before returning to Houston.  Life at Enron is pretty down these days.  I am very fortunate to still be employed.  As you prob know of the Houston employees were cut loose last Monday.  On Friday they swiped about half of ENA.  It was a bit of a shocker.  I thought layoffs would be minimal around this group.  Origination is almost non existant now.  Some good people I worked with or out.  Since I wasn't here Friday, I was really nervous coming in.  But I think it's ok for now.  They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor, or what is left of it.  They'll probably form a new patnership with a new name and everything.  Honestly, I think that is llikely to happen.  It's just a question of what will be left by the time that all happens.  I see on my streamer that CPN is down to 18 1/4.  Ouch.  Morgan Stanley downgraded the whole sector, what a bunch of geniuses.  Let's just hope for the best.  Ok then drop me a line when you have a chance.  My home address is esaibi@houston.rr.com in case Enron bites the dust.  Later  Eric

 Here's the load mix for Southern and TVA, for the region and top 5, in case you haven't gotten that far yet.  Don't understand why TVA (the utility) has no res/com load, but that's what PowerDat had.  Enjoy.  E 
 Sorry, Continental. 
 Listen, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.  That was not my intention.  I still care about you.  How could I not?  We were together for so long.  I'm just uncertain right now, about what type of relationship I would like to have with you.  I don't know.  Ok, thanks for listening.  Eric 
 Just like any other day, right?  Heh, heh. 
 Hey Dude, =20 Yeah the compnay is toast.  The story gets stranger every day.  Half of the= Houston office was laid off early December.  More to come I am sure.  My g= roup was purchased by UBS Warburg.  I am fortunate that they offered me a j= ob.  A bunch of guys in my group were not.  I feel lucky, things could be m= uch worse for me, but instead I have an opportunity to be part of a pretty = impressive organization.  Work has a actually been a little strange, since = the company had declared bankruptcy we litterally have nothing to do.  Sinc= e the first week of Dec, I've been going to work for maybe a couple hours a= day, just hanging out, talking to the other guys, surfin the net.  It give= s me the chance to take care of all the errand type stuff I normally don't = have a chance to.  I've been cooking a lot, taking care of my backyard, sel= lin shit on ebay, stuff like that.  Some of the other traders have been rea= ding trading books and stuff, but you know me...  By the way my permanent h= ome email is now esaibi@houston.rr.com <mailto:esaibi@houston.rr.com>. =20 I got your card that you sent to Adnan.  Thanks.  I'm not sure if I told yo= u, but I bought a house here a few months back.  When my Dad was planning t= o move here I thought it would be better to buy a place instead of renting = a big apt.  It's brand new, location is pretty good in that it is near a lo= t of things.  Although the area right around here is a bit sketchy.  I figu= re it'll probably get better over time.  I hope things are going well for y= ou.  When will you visit the U.S?  If you ever visit LA let me know.  I cou= ld always meet you there if you give me enough notice.  As you can imagine,= airline tickets are pretty cheap these days. =20 Can you believe Khan is married?  It was kinda strange cuz I was pretty muc= h the only one of his friends involved in the wedding.  His brother and fam= ily were able to show up for the ceremony at least.  That was good.  It was= a bit difficult because my Dad passed away the morning of his wedding, but= I knew I couldn't leave him then.  Khan has some pictures if he hasn't sho= wn you any yet.  He sent me a couple.  Well I gotta go to bed soon.  I'll d= o a better job keeping in touch.  It's just been a little difficult lately,= I'm sure you understand.  Don't work too hard. =20 Eric =20 6031 North Arrowana Lane Houston, TX  77036 USA =20 Check out these links re: my ebay success.  I got some heat about the chron= article.  They generally frown upon talking to the press at work.  This st= uff actually has been selling far above what the articles say, insane! =20 <http://news.com.com/2100-1017-816781.html?legacy=3Dcnet&tag=3Dmn_hd> =20 <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/business/1215116> =20 =20 
 Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of "Financial Portfolio Managment" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you kn
