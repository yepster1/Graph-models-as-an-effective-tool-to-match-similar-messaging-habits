 John  The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially different from the Thursday index.

 Tim  I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may help you prepare for Thursday.  Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load.  Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand.  Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking.  Very simplistic, but maybe it helps. Hunter 
 how did this go? 
 I don't remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on Saturday morning.  Thank You Hunter 
 Has the deal between you and Patrice been booked? 
 I will talk to her as well 
 looks good.  I can not think of anything to add. 
 I am sad to see you go.  Stop by if you have time.  Hunter 
 can you attend this? 
 Chris, can you attend this? 
 great 
 The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a basis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages this product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be selected for index calculation.  Hunter 
 has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would work like this:  Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable injection    .015 bid     .025 offer  I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.  call me 
 thanks 
 EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is EOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an increase in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need more info.  Hunter 
 EOL and Peoples 
 where did you get your copy of Green Markets? Hunter 
 The first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for parks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me know what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the deals? 
 Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?  Hunter 
 I think I have a meeting that starts at 4:00.  Please let them know that I can attend from 3:30-4:00. 
 Should we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust in the numbers. 
 The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three decimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make the basis column more straight? 
 I don't know if you read your email so I am forwarding this to you. 
 Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?  Thanks Hunter 
 I would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access through the firewall. 
 I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the product the index or product description in the index page.  I think the index calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the index page be calculated and posted? 
 Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.  We need to feel confident that the index is calculating correctly.  You can reach me at h-j@swbell.net  hunter 
 Brad  Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact statement was "If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have another talk".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.  Hunter 
 I have attached how I would do it.  check out the red comment marks.  Do not add day ahead + 1 I leave for Portland around 4:00  Thanks Hunter 
 next week sometime is possible.  not Tuesday  Hunter 
 Any more documentation on this deal?  Midwestern Gas Transmission 5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.  It provides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed commodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal to $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is greater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the spread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be $.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 through 10/31/00. 
 Donna  What is the ANSI Compliance Team?  Thanks Hunter 
 Colleen  What is XML?  Thanks Hunter 
 Laura  Dave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the Midwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to call you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  Thanks Hunter 
 I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every "Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above agreement.  Thanks Hunter 
 Dave    can you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data without placing multiple data in a given row?  I have attached an example. The first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.  This way I can sort the data in any fashion.  Thanks Hunter 
 can we create a link to a Chicago Hub EOL site?  If so, can the Chicago Hub site have new PA's and ETA's? 
 What is ETA and PA?  Thanks 
 we will need to do it after work sometime.  Let me know  Hunter 
 agreed 
 I feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing to look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.  I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants front-end production to be handled by her group.  We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow. 
 I am glad to hear your search is going well.  It sounds like you are on the right track.  Hunter 
 You need to get a mountain bike.  I like riding the trails through Memorial Park.  Nasdaq 5000 here we come Hunter 
 George,  what is our view on this?  Hunter 
 What is the latest on the EOL feeds.  I talked to Dave last week and he indicated it was no problem.  I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let me know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late nominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers changing their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated. Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.  Thanks Hunter

 sure.  Give me a call on the day that is best for you. 
  The following companies have stated that they will not execute trades with Enron.  Some of these decisions appear to be regional or product specific.  For example Aquila executed a trade in the Central region but will not trade with Sandra.  East - AEP Sempra Mirant J Aaron TXU Aquila BP Amoco  Price - Dynegy Bank of Montreal Vitol Phibro J Aaron  Options - Williams AEP BP Amoco Vitol Hess (will sell options only)  Central - Mirant Enbridge Vector P/L Transcanada Sempra BP Canada Coral Canada PG&E Trading Canada  West - Burlington Salt River Project Socal Gas Dynegy Phibro TXU Coral Engage WESCO Entergy-Koch J Aaron (They are clicking to close out positions only) Mirant (close out positions only)  Physical Trading  East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap  Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.  West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.  AEP was noticeably absent from all regions. 
 does this plan satisfy our needs? 
 gas is ok 
 let me know when you get back 
 The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.  Chris believes that he can create an accurate production forecast model by basin and county.  This would give us an edge in the overall and basis market.

I will attempt to gain access to him outside of Steve. 
 Can someone do a study on the tariffs of major pipeline storage fields to determine which fields require that storage gas is withdrawn regardless of price.  If not, how much to roll storage? 
 agreed 
  did you grab Bennett's internet favorites? 
 Grigsby would like to make an offer to Bob Badeer.  If you are ok with extending him an offer I think we should offer the same terms as his Portland deal.  Do you remember what we offered?

  Please make this change  Thank You Hunter 
  Chris,  what are our needs? 
 Fundies:  Due to rotations we need six analysts in Aug/Sept.  Chris has been assigned three new analysts from the pool.  I believe these people are outside of the 26 assigned to you.  We need a minimum of three.  If you want to give us up to six, we will send our allocation of three back to the pool.  We would also like a summer analyst. 
   Rain please forward to group 
 Sunday e-mail  hunter-jessica@houston.rr.com 
 I don't understand this 
 Friday may be best.  I need to check with the wife.  Hunter 
 can we get a calendar for factor changes? 
  I would like to pursue this with Jay Webb.  Do you support? 
 I will be in Chicago Thursday and Friday.  I will need to leave for the airport around 3:00.  Please let me know if you would like for me to call in.  Hunter 
  are we using this? 
 Yes.  Please communicate cost to me. 
  D  Could you please ask your assistant to change your supervisor for PRC from me to Laura.  Thanks Hunter 
 Can we delay the interviews by one hour?  AGA is released at 1:00 on Wednesdays. 
 Frank  Did this show in my Monday var? 
  Are we going to reschedule? 
 Chris Gaskill and I will do it.  Does the audience understand the basics of natural gas? 
 Please add a "daily change" column next to the "total position by trader" column.  Thanks Hunter 
  Daisy Liemonta - No - I think she is more suited towards a back office role.  However I am on the fence and If Presto wanted to bring her in, that is fine.  Eric Moncada - Yes - Trading experience and desire to learn fundamental trading  Sandy Wei-shan - No - little interest in trading 
  Fines:  I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.  EOL:  We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.  We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs. 
   Is it possible for Power to be on our floor?

 Technical issues  1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone volume starts to trail off.  2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.

 what is the latest  Hunter 
 Sounds good....marty mare knows where to get them as well.  See you Monday 
 the guys are not listed 
 Tim  I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may help you prepare for Thursday.  Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load.  Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand.  Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking.  Very simplistic, but maybe it helps. Hunter 
 how did this go? 
 I don't remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on Saturday morning.  Thank You Hunter 
 Has the deal between you and Patrice been booked? 
 This meeting should be on Geoff's calendar too. 
 I will talk to her as well 
 looks good.  I can not think of anything to add. 
 I am sad to see you go.  Stop by if you have time.  Hunter 
 can you attend this? 
 Chris, can you attend this? 
 great 
 The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a basis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages this product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be selected for index calculation.  Hunter 
 has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would work like this:  Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable injection    .015 bid     .025 offer  I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.  call me 
 thanks 
 book it 
 EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is EOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an increase in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need more info.  Hunter 
 EOL and Peoples 
 where did you get your copy of Green Markets? Hunter 
 The first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for parks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me know what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the deals? 
 Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?  Hunter 
 I think I have a meeting that starts at 4:00.  Please let them know that I can attend from 3:30-4:00. 
 Should we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust in the numbers. 
 The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three decimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make the basis column more straight? 
 I don't know if you read your email so I am forwarding this to you. 
 Ned Higgins met with Tim Herman on Friday.  However I don't think we are going to pursue the project.  How are ya? Hunter 
 Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?  Thanks Hunter 
 I would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access through the firewall. 
 I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the product the index or product description in the index page.  I think the index calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the index page be calculated and posted? 
 Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.  We need to feel confident that the index is calculating correctly.  You can reach me at h-j@swbell.net  hunter 
 Brad  Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact statement was "If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have another talk".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.  Hunter 
 I have attached how I would do it.  check out the red comment marks.  Do not add day ahead + 1 I leave for Portland around 4:00  Thanks Hunter 
 next week sometime is possible.  not Tuesday  Hunter 
 Any more documentation on this deal?  Midwestern Gas Transmission 5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.  It provides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed commodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal to $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is greater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the spread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be $.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 through 10/31/00. 
 Donna  What is the ANSI Compliance Team?  Thanks Hunter 
 Colleen  What is XML?  Thanks Hunter 
 I have little need for Volp at this time.  Thank You 
 Laura  Dave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the Midwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to call you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  Thanks Hunter 
 I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every "Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above agreement.  Thanks Hunter 
 Dave    can you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data without placing multiple data in a given row?  I have attached an example. The first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.  This way I can sort the data in any fashion.  Thanks Hunter 
 can we create a link to a Chicago Hub EOL site?  If so, can the Chicago Hub site have new PA's and ETA's? 
 What is ETA and PA?  Thanks 
 we will need to do it after work sometime.  Let me know  Hunter 
 agreed 
 I feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing to look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.  I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants front-end production to be handled by her group.  We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow. 
 I am glad to hear your search is going well.  It sounds like you are on the right track.  Hunter 
 ASAP - Tomorrow mid-morning would probably best for me but let me know 
 You need to get a mountain bike.  I like riding the trails through Memorial Park.  Nasdaq 5000 here we come Hunter 
 George,  what is our view on this?  Hunter 
 What is the latest on the EOL feeds.  I talked to Dave last week and he indicated it was no problem.  I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let me know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late nominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers changing their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated. Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.  Thanks Hunter 
 Trunkline LNG Company 5/18/00 - Trunkline filed for approval of a new rate schedule (LLS) for LNG= =20 Lending Service.  It is patterned on PALS services=01*short term loans, wit= h=20 repayment within 31 days.  any opportunities for us? Hunter 
 I will take a look.  Thanks again for letting me spend the day with you.  I have a call into Beth and I will let you know how that goes.  Thanks Hunter 
 We can accomodate you.  However I am not sure if Laura wants us to meet this week. 
 My map was blank.  Could you resend?  Thanks Hunter 
 looks good 
 yes....good idea 
 I would like for Colin and David to create security that gives access to the site for certain users only.  There are too many people logging in that we do not know.  We need to begin creating this list.  All Central, Texas, East, West, NYMEX desk and Chicago office traders (Richard Tomaski will provide the Chicago office names) Power traders Fundamentals Gas, Power, EIM Fred's group Lavo, Whalley, Kitchen, Frevert,  If you can think of any more let me know.  Can we implement the security this week? 
 I will be in the office all week.  Let me know when you guys would like to stop by  hunter 
 Hunter Shively - I have weather access and I would like to trade power  The remainder of the desk trades gas only 
 Unfortunately I am in Chicago on Thursday and Friday.  Hunter 
 These dates are good.  It would be best if they arrived between 8:30 and 10:30.  hunter

 Are we going to discuss these with Lavo before he makes a decision?  Hunter 
 Lisa and Jason should not be on our RC 
 yes 
 John  The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially different from the Thursday index.  We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.  I will discuss this with you tomorrow. 
 Rain,  Has Demetrion set up a meeting with you?  If not, please call him and arrange a time.  Thanks
