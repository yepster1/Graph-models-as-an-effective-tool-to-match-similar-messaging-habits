 Going to Scottsdale Wednesday night for a little sun, spa, and relaxation!   Have fun in Houston - 
 I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.  I will keep you posted - 
 What is the plan for tonight?  I am leaving and going home now.  Where would you like to meet and what time? 
 Still employed?  How are you affected by this bankruptcy news?

 Sara,  Salt River Project has attached their Schedule to the Master and their Credit support Annex to this email.  I know we have sent them our docs in the past so I don't know where this will take us.  It doesn't look like they have entered the pertinent credit information into the annex.  Are they expecting us to do this?  Please let me know what you think.  The guy that sent this to me is Mark Russell and his email address is below.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Some of these are pretty funny - 
 Hey,  Can you send over a list of people you know in this industry,  their companies and maybe their phone numbers?  For my charity golf tournament.  They were due on Tuesday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Send me your phone list as soon as you get a chance - my fax is 713-464-2391, phone 30685. THanks,  Kim 
 Did  you get a credit worksheet from Jay for Midesto Irrigation District - for a master Enfolio?  Kim 
 Jay,  Please call me when you get a chance. I have a list of customers that we use to serve out of our Socal pool that we want back.  However, we need to establish credit.  and then maybe some contracts.  Can I do < 1 year with these guys without a master ?  Maybe use the GTC?  I need to make some $ so WE can go to Pebble beach.  Kim 
 I left a message for ginger yesterday for lunch or dinner but havn't heard back.

 Mark,  The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.  Thanks for your inquiry -  Kim Ward 
 I left him a couple of messages but never heard back.  I will try to follow= up again today. 
 Jim,  Are you and or Steve Thome working with Black hills?  Should we work with E= OL to get them online instead of rejected?=20  Kim 
 here it is.  Check out B.4. and the last sentence which is our shared profit language.  Call me. 
 Sara,  I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti= ces.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  = The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or= der.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chris,  Could you send me Mary @ Socal's phone number - for the very last time?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Were we able to put together an agreement for Midesto Irrigation District? 
 Chris,  The package you sent me was delayed due to weather - I should get it in am. 
 I will try to show up - since it is right down the street from my house!  Looking forward to it!  Kim 
 I couldn't find your phone number -  financial offer at PG&E City Gate for 2 years out of may is $8.97.  Add $.14 for phys.  Kim

 when is the meeting and where?  thanks,  Kim 
 Here is Tucsons information.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kim 
 The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.  Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!! 
 Sorry I am just now replying - busy afternoon and I'm trying to get out for the baseball game.  My roulette number is 10.  I don't know how lucky it is, but it would be the number I would pick.  Have fun in vegas -  See ya, Kim 
 Chris,  I didn't make that many changes and I didn't change the ENA profit section.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will be on my cell phone after 4:00 p.m. here - going to opening day at Enron Field!!  Here it is - and I will have a copy and be able to discuss with you when you are ready.  Most of the desk is gone.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Yes, april 6th.  When I talked to her, she didn't think that Continental would have a seat avail for Memorial weekend, just like we said.  I think she is out. 
 Camille Gerard, a guy from the calgary office, and ja 
 mY messenger went down.  I am going with the same crew. Oh Yo 
 no.  See ya thurs. 
 Yes - if there is a spare ticket.  Boy, am I tired! 
 Tom,  Attached is your spreadsheet with the price indications that you asked for.  Call me if you need any thing else.  Kim 
 where's my email? 
 Dan,  Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges.  Thanks again,  Kim  ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system? 
 Michael,  FYI, I checked the physical premium for PG&E city gate for 10 years out of 2005 and the desk quoted $.07.   Hope this is helpful.  Kim 
 Chris,  this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.  Kim 
 Monica,  Attached is the previous draft contract with Grants latest wording inserted.  If you guys are agreeable, please accept the red-line changes, print 2 originals, sign, and forward to me for final execution.  I hope this is what you guys were expecting.  Please let me know if it is not so I can get with Dan.  Thanks for your help!  Kim 
 Me too!  I just got here - 
 Dan,  What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will forward to Monica?  Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Enron and two other counterparties 
 How was the air show? 
 Hi Jeff,  Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:  Q4, 2001                			    $11.70 2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80 5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85 Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38  I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.  Regards,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 I don't know if we want to do business with someone so unwilling to share information or provide guarantees.  Do you get any comfort from the information that you have seen or recieved?  Let me know what your opinion is.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Laird,  You can get prices from me any time - but you know I am always up for wine!!  Anyway, notional prices for Q4 at PG&E City gate are $11.65, 2 years out of  Jan., 2002 are $6.75, and 5 years out of Jan 2002 are $5.80.  Let me know if you need to do anything.  Also, what is your take on providing gas to all of these power plant developers.  I get at least one call per day from a different developer.  I am thinking that some of them will get built - for the state - but I can't determine who is worthy.  I have been short listed on PRMs RFP for Calpeak power, a sub of United Technologies.  They have no transport across Socal's or PG&E's systems (and neither do we) and United Technologies won't guarantee them 100%.  They said that they would provide "credit mechanisms built into the projects".  I asked what these mechanisms were and said that we take cash.  I haven't heard back!! Ha.  Kim 
 Barry,  FYI 
 I emailed chuck and told him we would be willing to take cash!!  I also just spoke with Ann Donnelly and she understands that if she wants us there, she will have to come up with something.  She is working on helping us establish the link between united technologies and calpeak as well as provide other info.  I will let you know what they come up with.  Thanks for your quick responses!  Kim 
 Are you going? 
 Chuck,  What would these credit support mechanism be?  We do accept cash!  Kim 
 How about lunch on Tuesday of next week - April 10th? 
 J. -  What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dave,  I think I mentioned this to you before, but I will also need the following attached to the ISDA:  1) duly executed tax forms ro certificates 2) evidence of authority to execute Master Agreement 3) specimen signatures (as to signatories to Master Agreement 4) financials 5) resolution to authorize execution of:  a)master agreement by specified parties and b)  all transactions under the master agreement 6) copy of  Articles of Incorporation 7) bylaws  ENA must provide the same documents to you.  You can ask Sara (pronounced Sora) questions regarding these documents once we get her on the phone.  Call me.  Kim 
 That would be cool - I get in at 5:59 pm on United from San Jose.  So how was napa?  I think that I need a napa trip sometime this year.  How was the place you stayed and where did you eat.  Did you buy any good wines?  What was your favorite? 
 Ann,  I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:  1400 Smith Street, EB3206a Houston, TX  77002  Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  Attached is a draft copy of our master purchase/sale contract that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will have my legal department standing by to assist.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Barry wants to set up lunch or dinner with you while you are here.  Just let me know if and when you would like to get together.  K. 
 I came in late because of my back - I think I am going to go to a chiropractor 
 got it.  Thanks. 
 What was the price they sold it to them for?  Dave told me about this when he did it.  It is all interuptible and no power will be sold to PD in Q3. 
 I have sent drafts to Long Beach, Glendale, Roseville, and Salt River Project.   However, I havn't received drafts for Anaheim, Los Angeles, midesto, or Arizona Public Service.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Kent,  Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully, we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get ready to transact.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing by to help, too.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Mike,  FINALLY, attached is the draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions and if there is any thing else I can do for you -  Have a good weekend.  Kim 
 Laird,  City of Corona California planning for form a muni utility and purchase power generators.  Article in today's NGI.  Let's get 'em!  K. 
 Hi Manny & Jack,  Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.  Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?  I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chris,  Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.  Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.  Have a good weekend -  Kim Ward 
 Chris,  The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium? 
 Darla,  This is what I have been able to find so far regarding fixed prices for citizens for Feb:  50,000/mo @ $7.55 50,000/mo @ $7.96 100,000/ mo @ $9.07  we also did a deal for 1,565/day @ $7.12.  Have they given you any information that you can compare this to?  Let me know if you have any questions and I will send you a spreadsheet with all fixed price deals I have done to date.  March and april should be final.  You can send me a monthly email when you are ready to do - say - mays invoice - and I will send you everything I have done with them.  Call me with questions -  Kim 
 Roger,  I don't know if you are the one to send this to but i am starting with you - let me know what we can do to take care of this EES customer.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Kathy,  Just had another moment to say hello.  How are you and how are things?  Still busy here - and I haven't even seen Robin - I think she has given up on me!!  In fact, I think I will call her when I finish this email.  At least I know I will see her in a couple of weeks when Chris and Katie come to houston.  Wish you could come with them - that would be fun!  Still working on the man situation - it was a topic of coversation amongst my friends last night.  I will keep you posted!  Hope all is well and keep in touch!!  Love, Kim 
 I got the agreement this morning but they misspelled Roseville!!  I am having them change it and will email it to you when I get it.  Do you want me to send you a hard copy or is an email version ok with you?  Let me know -  Thanks,  Kim  PS How are things? 
 Dave,  Sorry I am just now responding - I have been very busy and lost this email but found it today.  I am in houston working my tushy off and trying to get moved into my house.  My new numbers are 713-853-0685 (w) and 713-412-4571 (c) and 713-526-7117 (h).  How are things with you? your job?  did you guys end up moving - I can't remember.  Hope all is well - and I will do better about responding to emails!  Kim 
 Dan,  Can you send a template of the GISB agreement to this guy?  thanks,  Kim 
 Dan Hyvl - we sent them a draft two/three weeks ago. 
 Also, check the salt river project one. 
 Debra,  In the contract for Roseville, you guys have it spelled Rosedale 
 WEre these sent out to the counterparties or do I need to do that? 
 Chris,  Attached is a new spreadsheet with the PG&E, Large Packages Gas Daily prices.  This price is for the PG&E topock point.  It is VERY illiquid.  The desk is going to start posting prices for it on EOL in order to add more liquidity.  As you can see, there are days where there were no prices published for this point in Gas Daily.  As for Griffith, maybe PG&E topock should be the benchmark because Citizens truly doesn't have an alternative market.  Although they can change their primary delivery point to the border, the fact is that it probobly wouldn't flow because the line is already full.  Where can Citizens actually (not theoretically) extract the greatest value for this capacity?  I disagree with Griffiths comment that this price is more reflective of the market - what market?  Very little has traded there in the past.  One issue that we/Citizens needs to think about is hedging capabilities to PG&E topock.  I know when we were talking to them about our capacity, we priced it based on the SJ/Socal spread and they were agreeable to that.  But then again, we could actually flow gas to the border.  Sorry for rambling - 
 Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name - I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move for me.  My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.  Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch  Kim 
 Suz - here are the details -  Arrive in PHX Wednesday, April 11 @ 7:30 p.m.  Take a taxi to the Cottonwood resort  which is $199.00/night with two double beds and I think a fold out couch.  Suites with a hot tub on a private patio.  Lots of wine drinking.  No real going out but dinner at the Terra Cotta Restaurant one night.  Lots of spa treatments and sunbathing, and magazine reading.  VERY relaxing.  We leave sunday at 1:30 pm.  Call me and let me know if you want to go!!  Kim 
 Chris,  I can't read these - but my real quesiton is - If the $.07 is a demand charge and Grigsby gets $.04, we should still get the other $.03 because it will be charged on all volumes that CAN be taken, whether they take them or not - right?? 
 Dan,  Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.  Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.  Kim 
 ok 
 Sara,  I am available all day wednesday but will be out of the office on Thursday.  Let me know when you would like to meet.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Lynn,  I thought you might be interested in the new draft proposal for the QFs in Cali.    Kim 
 I did make it home - and I managed to catch an airplane at 8:00 the next morning, have two meetings, attend a reception, and go to dinner.  Needless to say, I was very tired by the time I got home on Friday night!!  It was a fun week for me too - I got to see people that I hadn't seen in four years.  As for the weather, you aren't missing anything here this week - cold and rainy - just like portland!  Let me know when you're around - margaritas on a patio is always fun  Kim 
 Dan,  Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help me put together the confirmation?  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks Bonnie,  this is very helpful information.  Myself and/or Barry Tycholiz will be in touch with Chris very soon.  Thanks again,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Dan,  Thanks for looking at this for me.  Could you recommend something not so awkward?  Sat, Sun & Mon would be the price published on Tuesday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so that we are legally comfortable with it?  Thanks,  Kim 
 We leave for Scottsdale just two weeks from today. 
 THis looks good to me.  thanks,  Kim 
 Hey,  Go to the Enron home page and look for image center.  It should have everything you need and more for a presentation or enron "rock star" info!!  Let me know if it works for you!  Kim 
 I just got a cheesey email from George Denos - very funny!!  He wants to have margaritas when he returns to Houston.  I am laughing out loud!! 
 I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some GREAT recommendations -  1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are little bungalows.  2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @ www.aubergedusoleil.com.  You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!  The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??  Let me know what you think of my suggestions - 
 MJ,  How are you?  It was good to see you when I was out there.  Things here are busy as ever!  I have some guy friends going to napa valley in a couple of weeks and they would like a recommendation for a place to stay.  I know you have stayed in napa before - do you have any recommendations?  I appreciate your travel agency services!!  I hope all is well and to see you soon.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Bob,  I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.  Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 AS we discussed. 
 Call me - it looks like $20 is excessive - and I agree, the term sheet he put together is lame.  Hope these numbers are what you were looking for - 
 For your information, attached is the information that Long Beach has sent me regarding their historical load, pricing, etc.  I haven't gone through it yet but thought you should have a copy.  Kim 
   Call me if you have any questions!  Kim 
 Guys,  Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August, 2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.  Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50 bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.  Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!  Thanks,  Kim 
   I 
 Sara,  Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.  Thanks!  Kim 
 Jan,  Thanks for the email.  It is amazing what two days out of the office will do to my workload!!  I had two RFPs due yesterday - very busy!  I am going to work on our 'thoeoretical' deal that we discussed on Friday to see if there is anything there.  Hopefully, I can come up with something.  Thanks for the info on that.  Call me any time you want to discuss power - I will be glad to share with you what I know.  Thanks again for spending some time with us and hopefully we can come up with a good structure that is good for both of us!!  Have a good day -  Kim 
 The expense should have shown up on my hotel receipt and was authorized and approved by my boss.  This expense should be reimbursed. 
 Ann,  Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.  The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.  Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Desk is currently looking at this. 
 Bonnie,  Sorry I am just now getting back - I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  What I am trying to determine is the rate that Long Beach wants to beat and what it is made up of - so I would say both transmission and commodity prices.  Let me know if you have any more questions -  Thanks,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Are we still looking at June through Oct only?

   ----- Original Message ----- Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!    Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults.  What do most people do on a date?  Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.  --Lynette, age 8  On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10  What would you do if a date was not working  out?  I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age  When is it okay to kiss someone?  When they're rich. --Pam,age 7  The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that. --Curt, age  The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8  How would the world be different if people weren't  married?  There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8  What is the right age to get married?  No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6  Is it better to be single or married?  It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them. --Anita, age 9  I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8  How do you decide who to marry?  You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10  No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10  How can a stranger tell if two people are  married?  You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8  What do your mom and dad have in  common?  Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age  How would you make a marriage work?  Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10 
 Chris,  When you get a chance, I have a couple of questions about this term sheet.  i.e., 8:00 vs 8:30. 
 E.  Make sure the reservations are for the ocean blvd. patio side. ( not the patio in the back)  I hope this is not too much trouble.  We want to sit with the rock stars!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 If you guys are staying at the Auberge - it is suppose to have great food.  Also, the Culinary Institute.  when are you going?

 Thanks - you are truely a Rock Star! 
 Because  I had an updated curve for PG&E and not for Malin.  I asked the Malin trader - he hadn't updated his curves but the other guy had.   I am going to start asking so that I am consistant.

 I am one of the houston people - myself and 5 of my friends.  Moved back in January. 
 That price indication does reflect the time value of money - so - if bought - power in 2001 would be billed at $61/MWh.  Kim 
 Arnold,  I must have been looking at the wrong index or report.  I have now gotten access to Natural Gas Intelligent's web-site so I can give very fast and accurate prices.  I am sorry for the confusion and hope that I didn't cause a lot of trouble.  Just so you know, april was $12.56 plus the $.05 premium.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kimi 
 No.  Have you talked to her?  I have been busy - my usual excuse.  I went to Scottsdale last weekend.  It was great!  What have you been up to?  K. 
 Hello everyone,  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all fixed price deals that I have done with Pasadena as well as my term sheet for February and March.

 I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.  Thanks for your help!  Kim 
 Hey Doug,  How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway, can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when I get back.  Have a great weekend,  Kim Ward 
 Call my co-worker, Phil Polsky @ 713-853-5181.  He will be ready to help you out with whatever you need.  If he can do this today - it would be good.  Thanks,  Kim

 I will have it checked out.  Are you getting things ok now? 
 J -  This is some more info from willis - Thanks for looking into this.  By the way - we lost the Calpeak deal.  K. 
 would you think I was crazy if I told you I thought we were going to sell three years of gas to knauf?? 
          Dan:  To help your prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.  PG&E Large Packages Index Trends  1.   PG&E Large Packages is the interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern into PG&E.  The interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern and Kern into SoCal is referred to as SoCal Border.  2.   PG&E gas supply comes in from three main pipelines:  PGT (Canada), El Paso/Transwestern (San Juan and Permian) and Kern River (Rockies).  With the exception of a few very cold days in Canada and the Northwest, the cheapest supply comes from Canada.  The other two pipes are similarly priced, based on the incremental cost of gas out of the Southwest and what options the supply has.  There is always some marginal demand for supply out of the Southwest into PG&E, but it can be a small number of only about 500,000 MMBtu/d in a shoulder month and 1,000,000 MMBtu on a peak day.  When it is a low demand day PG&E large packages will trade like Malin (PGT interconnect to PG&E).  On a peak day PG&E large packages trades like SoCal border.  3.  Effective April 1, El Paso changed the way gas moves on their system.  It used that anyone with primary delivery point capacity to PG&E could deliver into SoCal on a primary basis.  Now, if you have PG&E primary, you can only get into SoCal on an alternate delivery point basis.  Because capacity is constrained, PG&E primary capacity will generally not flow into SoCal.  Thisis why PG&E Large Packages trades at a discount to SoCal Border.  4.  PG&E large packages is the relevant index for the PP&L deal:  PG&E trades at a significant discount to SoCal because of the reasons listed above.    Anyone with primary SoCal delivery will want to go into SoCal.  This leaves the PG&E capacity as the marginal capacity that folks could use for delivery to Griffith.  If anyone owns primary delivery into SoCal they will use it there.  Citizens is offering Griffith a discount relative to these suppliers.  The good news is that PG&E delivery is still very strong because given the gas supply balance in California the marginal supply out of the southwest is needed.  5.  PG&E large packages is becoming more liquid:  Now that El Paso has changed the way gas moves on their pipeline there is a much more distinct difference between the types of capacity on El Paso.  Folks that own capacity want ways to hedge its value.  Enron has recognized this and plans to introduce the PG&E large packages point on Enron Online, our internet based trading system.  Trading volume at the PG&E point has increased in the last month and is expected to continue to increase.  This is good for Citizens as the liquidity makes the index more reflective of the market.  It also reduces the risk that the index doesn't print as has often occurred in the past.  (See historical data attached).  It also reduces the spread between the bid and offer at that point.  6.  PG&E Large Packages has gotten much stronger:  it used to be that the San Juan/SoCal Border spreads barely covered variable transport expense.  Now the demand is much stronger in CA and the transportation value has increased.   California is short storage due to growth in demand with the new power plants and the strong economy.  Although demand due to the economy is likely to fall, the new power plants and short storage position still create a very bullish situation.  For example, current valuations for the PG&E index are in the attached spreadsheet below: 
 it's all good - I was looking at the wrong file.  Sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Got your voice mail message.  Just email your list to me.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Jeff,  Make it another $.35 instead of $.50.  Let me know what else you need.  I fI could see your model, it would help me with your model.  K. 
 I know - I was scared!  I just had to get out of there!! Some help you were - I thought we suppose to go to a martini bar -- - - - - - - - 
 What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he is out of luck and on his own! 
 Ola -  Hope your vacation was good!  Barry and I are planning a trip to Tucson and will tentatively be flying in from California the morning of April 27th to meet with you.  Just wanted to send you the email so that we can talk about it as soon as you get back.  We are waiting on you to buy our tickets.  Let me know.  Adios Amigo  K. 
 Miss Sloney,  When are you coming to Phoenix?  Suzanne gets in at 11:00 p.m. on Friday night and leaves sunday at 1:15.  I leave here wednesday at 6:40 on Southwest from hobby and get there at about 7:25.  I leave sunday at 10:20 a.m. ( I couldn't get a good fair when I bought my ticket for a later time.)  Let me know what's going on - I hope you can go hike camel back mountain with us!  Kimmie 
 Hey, where is the closest airport to Long Beach?  May be in town on april 26th.  Trying to get from San Jose to Long Beach. 
 I am very good!  I am coming to arizona tomarrow night.  For my spa vacation.  Phoenix man is picking me up.  (Don't tell Hansen)  Melissa was coming with me but her grandmother passed away.  Very sad.  My friend Suzanne is coming late Thursday night or early friday morning.  Maybe we could have dinner on Thursday night?  Just a though - we could touch base on thursday and see what's going on.  My cell number is 713-412-4571. 
 Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!  And you thought I had a strong personality!!!  Going to Palo Alto Thursday - hope to get a management services deal. 
 Monica,  Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  I pulled these off of our curves and adjusted them for today's price movements.  If you would like to transact, we will have to get more refined prices approved by the desk, which shouldn't take too long.  Just let me know -  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sorry for not leaving a message - I just thought that maybe you would get an email faster.  We ended up leaving Downing a little after midnight.  Not too much later than you.  My weekend was OK.  I am tired of working on my house!  Anyway - went to the baseball game yesterday.  It was nice to be  out in the sun.  Hope your weekend was good.  And now that you have my number - you will have to be the brave one!  Kim 
 that is good news. 
 Linda,  Here is my very short list for the tournament. My friend Melissa Reese has said she will volunteer. Gas has been so crazy over the past week - I have been extremely busy! Sorry I am so late. I will continue to add or fill in blanks until you tell me I can't any more. I have been asked if there is room for sponsors - I said yes to sponsoring teams.  I will also try to gather trinkets as I get a chance.  Keep in touch -  thanks,  Kim

 Willis,  I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.  Thanks,  Kim 
 You had the wrong number - 713-412-4571.  Sorry. 
 Never heard from you Friday - I was sick all weekend - didn't leave the house until yesterday.  I just hope I feel better for my trip wednesday. 
 socal indicative offers:  1 year out of august = $12.76, 3 years = $8.50 , and 5 years = $7.15.  sorry but bid week is hard to just work up prices.  next week should be better.  Kim 
 Dan,  Most things here look good.  From my term sheet, page 1 under El Paso Capacity, what about selling them San Juan gas?  (B.)  And what about page three, number 8?  Let me know -  thanks,  Kim 
 I have added Socal to the worksheet.  The prices listed are as of last night.  Nymex is up $.04 - $.05.  Basis is pretty much the same.  Let me know if you need anything else and I will let you guys know as soon as I get the option information.  thanks,  Kim 
 Jack,  Attached is a graph showing storage year by year.  We are expecting another rather large injection this week.  Cal 02 Nymex is up about $.0125 but the balance of 01 is down about a penny.  There is no weather to speak of and therefore,  no demand for physical gas - this is what is driving prices down.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Am still working on the option pricing.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Boring!  things are slow here, too.  Playing golf Fri? 
 Let me know what you want to do about a load forcast model.  thanks,  Kim 
 Hello again,  Attached is a worksheet showing price indications for Calls that are $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00 out of the money.

Let me know if there is another way that you would like to look at them.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hey Chris,  glad to hear from you.  I am going to try to make it by your party tomarrow night - and perhaps, bring my friend Camille.  Let me know if there is anything that I can bring.  See you then -  Kim

 Trip was great!!  Got some sun, some spa treatments, and drank frozen girlie drinks.  Can't wait for Cozumel!!  Any more bad dates lately?  I had one last night - a man with a little too much personality for me!! 
 You can count me in - what can I bring? 
 Suzanne had previous plans so I thought that I didn't confirm the reservation.  I will be in the Grenadine Islands on the 14th - what's the occasion?  I think we will try to come in August some time.  Will that be OK? 
 We did have fun - Camille was interested in the other Chris and wouldn't leave - I think we were loaded too.  Sorry for flirting a little too much - I don't know if you told Stanton that I hit on you until 5 in the morning or if he just read that into your story - but it drove him crazy. He called my house at 2:30 am Sunday morning very drunk and being very wierd!  Anyway, it was a great party - thanks for the invitation.  Until next time -  Kim 
 Chris,  I asked patti for the information and she never got back to  me.  Will follow up and definitely get the info tomarrow.  Sorry.  Kim.

I usually get here between 7:30 and 8.  Today - exactly 8 o'clock!

 I have been wondering all week whether you got on the boat.  I looked at continental's specials and their weren't any for this weekend.  But if you plan ahead or are flexible on flight times, you can definitely get here for less than $200!  HOw was the rest of your trip?  Anything exciting to report?  How was your time with Turbo?  I wish it were last wednesday!  I think I am going to sell all of my belongings and live on a beach somewhere!!  Let me know what's going on!  K2  oh Yeah,  I got some pictures back and will send you some.  what is your address? 
 What did you do in Rome????  you must have had Capt. Neil.  I understand that he is a big golfer.  when did you go?  I can do lunch - what time? 
  Stephanie,  Can you help me answer John's questions regarding our capacity and deliveries to Nogales?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Stacy,  Where are we with the Mesa document?  They are extremely concerned - they must go through an act of congress to get anything signed.  thanks,  Kim 
 Darla,  Attached is the latest and greatest of my crude deal spreadsheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Call me when you get a chance and we can go over your questions about the June invoice as well as any other items we need to discuss.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Could you guys look into this for me?  Why would they be billed different volumes by us vs. SoCal?  Thanks,  Kim 
 I just got back in the office today after being out since the 12th.  I have forwarded your email to Patti Sullivan and Jan Sutherland.  Once I hear from them, I will let you know.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sorry, 
 Were you able to find anything regarding BHP's guarantee? 
 Lou,  Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.  Thanks,  Kim 
 John,  Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.  I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of Stephanie Miller who is the tport expert in our group.  Then you can decide how you would like to persue.  Stephanie will be available in the morning before 11:00 am CDT.  Please give me a call when you can -  Thanks,  Kim 
 Janette,  Attached is a copy of the Master agreement we have in place with you.  Please let me know if you are unable to open it.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I am in for friday too. 
 Where's my BHP doc???????????? 
 Janette,  Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.  Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day but have moved back up.  Thanks,  Kim 713-853-0685 
 Janette,  I did leave you a voice message.  The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.  Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Any status on the Citizen's updates? 
 Rolling in to work at 8:30 something? 
 Laird,  Call me if you have any quesitons.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I was working out at 5:30 this a.m.!  What's the matter with you?  Were you able to get the trailer off of your truck?  When I got home, Suzanne came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.  Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met Suzanne at the park for a jog.  Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City.  Lonely, huh?  When does Lawrence move in?  K. 
 Janette,  We are offered at $2.69 for San Juan gas for August.  The adders for scheduling are the same.  Let me know if there is anything else that you need.  Sorry for the delay but I think we've gotten everything straightened out here.  The trader just had a computer issue.  '  Thanks,  Kim 
 what kind of breakdown?  when did I ever have a breakdown?  A mini mid-life crisis maybe (hence the belly ring).  Nothing new - stayed in town this weekend and had a fun relaxing time.  Theresa just called and wanted to know if I was going to COGA.  I had to break the bad news!  When Lisa and her current boyfriend break up - (gerald met him too) I will let you know!  So what is going on the weekend Barry is making us go up to Denver?  Should I come in on Sat - since I can't go to NYC for the US open!! 
 Sean,  Attached is a document with the changes we discussed.  Let me know how things are going with your legal staff as well as with the collateral section.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks so much for sending the CDs.  I really didn't think I would ever see them again!  I take it that you are still considering coming back to windjammer.  I guess it will depend on what happens when you get home.  Kim 1, Stacy, Susie and I are considering the Poly trip in January.  I haven't been to those islands (St. Martin, St. Barts, etc.) yet so I might have to go.  I can't imagine a place better than the caribbean - I would love to see it!  So if you're not serious - don't tease me!  Take care and thanks again for the CDs - Love, K2 
 Night Shift was on Showtime Saturday afternoon - thought of you and your stellar performance of one particular scene. 
 Please call me. 
 Linda,  Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!  I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.  I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you could join us!  I hope all is well with you - take care!  Kim 2 
 I have conference room # 3268 reserved for 3:30 today.  Steve Snyder and Tom Goudie of Hesco may be here in person.  Thanks for your participation.  Let me know if any of you have a conflict.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Jason is available at 3:30 and I agree we should get together before - do you want Jason involved?  We could meet at 3:30 and bring Hesco in at 4:00.  Let me know your thoughts.  thanks,  Kim 
 we should get financials from Knauf friday morning in the over night mail - I will keep you posted.  I think we can get this deal.  Also, we are three more deals and $100,000 closer to Pebble Beach - I sold gas to Palo Alto yesterday.  How are things coming with Willis Bennett's customers?  K./ 
 H. & C. were suppose to get back from Hawaii on Saturday.  H had to leave on Sunday for Maine but was suppose to return last night or today.  I don't have Mrs. Mauney's number but I think my mom has it if you want to call her - 901-396-0399.  Still trying to figure out this weekend.  I would love to play golf instead of go to that dumb picnic.  One problem is that I pulled the daylights out of my left hamstring and it is affecting my game.  I will keep you posted.  K. 
 Ok - we will meet at 3:30 and call hesco at 4. 
 Try kim.ward@ect.enron.com.  If that doesn't go through, just try kim.ward@enron.com.  Thanks for sending it to me!  Take care -  Kim 
 Jane,  The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.  thanks,  Kim 
 SMUD is buying, we are selling.  It is a fixed price call - not gas daily. 
 Here is the lastest spreadsheet of deals I have done with Citizens.  Please call if you have questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 J.,  BHP is still in the market for Balance august San Juan.  Can we do this or can you call that guy that spiro recommended ASAP?  Please let me know.  thanks,  Kim 
 I didn't get it.  It may be because you sent it to Kim.Ward@ect.enron.com.  Sometimes that works and sometimes not. If you get a chance to try kim.ward@enron.com it would be great. Sorry for the trouble!  Thanks for helping me out!  Kim 2 
 What do you want to do with bhp for august? 
 It's official - I am coming in on Saturday, Sept. 8.  Missing the matchbox 20 concert here in houston! 
 Wes,  Attached is our Master Firm Purchase/Sale agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions - I can have our legal team standing by to answer them.  Also, if you need any price info, just let me know.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Chris,  Besides making this consistant and pretty, how does this spreadsheet look to you?  Am I leaving anything out?  According to the desk, they didn't take much during July.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.  Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  Don't know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?  I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.  Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?  or just my drinking goggles? 
 any news on doing a one month deal with bhp? 
 I think he gets in around 3.  I can try to arrange the same and we can go straight there.  Where do you want to play? 
 John,  Sorry this took me so long but I had to wait for the schedulers and Janey.  Let me know how it looks to you.  Thanks for your help.  Kim 
 Trader says to just use the mid curves.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kim 
  Hey,  just heard from the girls that you are now a tv star.  They saw you on some E! Entertainment special.  I am sorry to say that I missed it!  How are you and where are you?  I am assuming that you have now left the boat and are wondering your way to Austrailia.  Hope you are enjoying yourself.  I just spent the weekend in Memphis - visiting family and friends.  It was a lot of fun!  If the show runs again and I am able to see it, perhaps I will record it for you!  Have fun and keep in touch!  K2 
 What's up with BHP?  HESCO?  I was gone most of friday and feel like I was gone longer.  Call me when you get a chance.  Kim 
 Sara,  The City of Glendale is ready to set up a conference call to go over the minor changes that they would like to see in the ISDA agreement.

 We will have our conference call with Glendale at 3:30 our time on Wednesday.  Is your office OK?   Jay, if you would like to join us, you are welcome.  I don't know if any of their changes will include the credit annex or not.  Sara, Steve will also want to know what else we need from him ( I know it is listed in the doc) and when he needs to provide such.  Thanks for your assistance!  Kim Ward 
 If it is ok with you, we will meet in your office and call them.  Let me know.  Thanks, Kim 
 It was very fun - and busy.  Glad to see everyone and to hang out with Harriet and Angie for more than a few minutes.  how was your weekend?  Did you go to greenwood? 
 Ann,  Can you check on the palo alto confirms for deals that were done around the 20th of July?  I think there are about three confirms they have not received and Karla at Palo Alto is going to get in trouble internally.  thanks,  Kim Ward 
 This was hilarious!  I can't believe that you remember I have a cat!  How are things? 
   Chris,  Call me if you have any questions.  These prices are pretty much where our offers are.  Also, I didn't do anything with the physical premium.  We could probobly get is lowered.  Let me know.  thanks,  Kim 
 Anne,  I just got another phone call from Palo Alto.  They still have not received three of their confirms from deals done around the 20th of July.  They have ceased to do additional business with us until they receive these confirms.  thanks,  Kim 
 Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!  And you thought I had a strong personality!!!  Going to Palo Alto Thursday - hope to get a management services deal. 
 Jeff,  If you have the tracking number for the financial info you sent, I can track it down this morning.  Let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Any word on BHP copper?  We have a couple of days to determine whether we can transact with them or not.  Right now, they are only looking at Bal Aug, Sep, and Oct San Juan.  Let me know  Thanks,  Kim 
 What's up with this?  they are looking to lock in 12-16 months of gas prices.  We have been selling to them month to month for 6 months.  Have there been any problems?  Are we going to let them go to Amoco? 
 I just talked to Jay and he doesn't want to do a long term deal with them.  I have a call in to the consultant.  Max Jay might agree to is 3 months. 
 try dennis.holcomb@smud.org <mailto:dennis.holcomb@smud.org>  OR  dholcom@smud.org <mailto:dholcom@smud.org>.  told him he should get it tomarrow.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I don't know - maybe we should talk to Ann Bike.  I guess it should go in as an annuity.  Would you like for me to talk to Ann? 
 I would love to - I really like going to the movies but never seem to make it!  Only one stipulation though - we don't go see planet of the apes!  I heard it was REALLY bad - possibly the worst movie ever made. 
 Janette,  Could you do me a huge favor and have Vito give Jay Williams of our credit department a call.  Jay is having trouble getting through the pohone lines to you guys for some reason.  Jay has tried to track down some financial information internally and has had no luck and doesn't know where else to look.  His number is 713-345-3923.  I really do appreicate you passing this message along.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Ann will be calling you today and will set this deal up for you.  I am assuming this is for the June payment.  Kim 
 Darla,  will you send me and Ann Bike the June spreadsheet that you are working off of?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks, but I meant the one related to the Griffith deal.  Do you have one? 
 I will try to find out and let you know. 
 Christopher J -  We missed you for sure!  It was a fun time.  I was glad to see everyone.  Nothing exciting took place - just a little dancing and visiting.  All went home at midnight.  Boy have we become boring in our old age!  Take care and keep in touch!  Kimberly Susan 
 J.  Please give me a call asap regarding the threshold amounts listed in Glendale's ISDA draft.  thanks,  Kim 
 I will be out October 17 - 19th.  Kim 
 I've got Travis on the phone RIGHT NOW with Hesco info.  I want to conference you in 
  This is ok with me - I take it we have used the "long form" with them in the past.  If this is the case, can we get an isda draft together for them?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Ann & Darla,  I am attaching a spreadsheet that details what should be booked and billed to Citizens under the NEW gas daily call option/transport deal to serve the Griffith plant.  It is somewhat complicated but don't be scared - I will help both of you understand what needs to be done.  Hopefully, we can set up a procedure whereby this deal can be taken care of each month.  I think we should set up a meeting to discuss.  Let me know when you guys are available - hopefully sometime monday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 what time do we need to leave to make 2:45 
 Attached are my changes  Kim

  Jan,  If you guys are interested in participating in this open season, it would be just a matter of filling out paperwork and Stephanie has everything that you would need.  Let me know what other question you have or information that you might need.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I guess we need to talk about September. We need to roll the deal or I need to remove them from my socal pool by Tuesday.  What are you guys thinking? 
 Jan,  I tried to email you earlier but it didn't work.  I will be sending you another email too.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Ellen,  Since Richard is out, could you possibly help me with something when you have time?   Can you check on the monthly confirms for sales to Smurfit and let me know what we've gotten back from them and what is still out standing?  Call me if you have any quesitons.  Thanks!  Kim 
 J.  Can I roll smurfit to september?  thanks,  Kim 
 Travis,  Any news on Hesco documents?  Let me know when you think you will haev something.  Thanks,  Kim 
   ----- Original Message ----- Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!    Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults.  What do most people do on a date?  Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.  --Lynette, age 8  On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10  What would you do if a date was not working  out?  I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age  When is it okay to kiss someone?  When they're rich. --Pam,age 7  The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that. --Curt, age  The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8  How would the world be different if people weren't  married?  There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8  What is the right age to get married?  No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6  Is it better to be single or married?  It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them. --Anita, age 9  I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8  How do you decide who to marry?  You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10  No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10  How can a stranger tell if two people are  married?  You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8  What do your mom and dad have in  common?  Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age  How would you make a marriage work?  Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10 
  Ellen,  Palo Alto is telling me that they need Enron signatures on all of the confirms that we sent them last week.  If you could print out copies and have them sent to me, I can get Barry to sign them and overnight them to Palo.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Karla,  We are printing the confirms and signing them this morning and will fax them to you soon after.  If a faxed signed copy is not ok, please let me know and we will send you originals overnight.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  Let me know if you have any questions - I can get the lawyer on the phone.  Also, once I get that master, I will pass it on to you.  thanks,  Kim

 Darla,  I did run across some missing NSP deals for June and July and some price mismatches for a couple of NSP deals for July.  For June, 3000/day priced at $4.70 and fior July. 3,100/day priced at $4.79.  Also, I am resending you July and the Yellow highlights show the two deals that I don't agree with the price.  Call me with quesitons  Thanks,  Kim 
 Darla,  I have revised the spreadsheet I have been sending you with the fixed prices for the citizens deal.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to see additional enhancements.  As deals are done, I will continue to update this spreadsheet.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  Attached is a term sheet describing our proposal for September.  The changes are highlighted in yellow.  One of the things you guys might be interested in looking at long term is extending the current fixed price deals that you have and blending the price.  Another is a peaking option or cap.  We can talk about these things on the phone. Give me a call when you have a chance to review the term sheet and let me know what you guys want to do.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Debra,  What is the status of this document?  Customer is asking for it.  Please let me know -  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chris,  When you get a chance, I have a couple of questions about this term sheet.  i.e., 8:00 vs 8:30. 
            I think this is everything.  I will also forward more info if I can find it.  Thanks,  Kim 
 ok - not a problem.  Kim 
 Steve,  I need your help with something.  I want to look at Pasadena's load profile and am having trouble obtaining this.  Is it possible for you to send me your actual daily burns for up to the past two years?  This would be helpful in assisting you with your risk management needs and with structuring products specifically for Pasadena.  Let me know if you can help.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Karla,  I don't see the attachment.  Could you send it again?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Janine,  Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Funny - I get an email from you and Keith Aaron on the same day!  Not much going on - just settling down and staying home a while since I traveled non-stop June and July.  I have planned to go to Aruba in October (16th - 20) and then to St. Martin etal in January.Come to Aruba and bring friends.  We are staying at the Allegra Resort all-inclusive.  But we are somewhat boring - sun, san, surf, and a few suds.  Let me know what else is going on!  Oh, yeah - my home email address is kward1@houston.rr.com.  My boss is nosy and reads my emails!  Take Care,  Kimmie 
 Ann,  Would you be able to meet this afternoon (2:00) with my self and Janine Cashin to discuss the first Palo Alto invoice and what is in the system for July?  It shouldn't take very long - maybe 15-20 minutes.  Please let me know  Thanks,  Kim 
 Lou,  We are working up some prices for you today.  I will call you when we have those numbers.  Let me know if you need anything else in the mean time.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Lyndon,  I finally got my CDs back yesterday and I was so happy!  Thanks again for making sure that they were sent to Miami.  How are you?  Where are you?  where have you been?  Since I have to sit in this office everyday staring at a computer screen, I must live vicariously through people like you!  I'm actually not traveling until mid september.  I go to Denver on sept. 8 - 10 and then to Southern California the following week.  October brings Arizona, Aruba, and perhaps northern california.  Looking forward to Aruba - don't really care about the rest since they are work!!  Anyway - hope all is well with you and that you are enjoying yourself - wherever you might be!  Take care,  K2

 Darla,  Could you please remit to John Cogan $1,275.54 for a brokering fee due him related to sales to Citizens Utilites for June, 2001.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 J.  Barry wants to know the credit status post the financial info I gave you yesterday.  he is meeting with Mark Baldwin on Thursday and wants to prepare.  K. 
 Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.  kw 
 Willis,  I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Jan, too, says that smurfit is not running the cogen and that they don't expect to for quite some time.  I asked her to let me know if they do decide to start the turbine.  Will keep you informed -  Kim 
 J. & Stacy,  Barry would like to set up a meeting to discuss CDWR from both a Credit and Legal standpoint before he goes to see them on Thursday.  Please let me know when you are available and I will set up the meeting.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dennis,  I can sell you the 3.46 red winter nymex swap right now (2:22 pm) .  Call me ASAP  Thanks,  Kim 
 How is 10:30 am Wednesday, 8/29?  I am having jessica reserve a room and once I get your confirmations, I will forward the room location to you.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Travis and Stacy,  I just heard from the Hesco guys and they would like to set up a meeting or conference call to discuss the master and collateral assignment documents.  I think that they have some questions and comments.  Please let me know when you are available and  your preference, meeting or conference call, and I will set it up.  Thanks,  Kim 
 When: Wednesday, August 29, 2001 10:30 AM-11:00 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: EB 3267  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
 This is all of the info that I have on these customers but I may be able to get more if it is valuable to you.  just let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  These are some examples of the blend and extend deals that we discussed earlier.  Like I said, these are just some examples that we came up with but we can look at different terms and volumes for each of them.  Let me know if you have questions and we can go over this any time.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Craig,  I agree with Charlie.  I wasn't here until January so I was not aware of the Dec. 28 deal.  I think that when we do August, my information should be complete.  Sorry for all of the inconveniences.  Thanks for your help.  Kim  p.s.  I will tell Darla. 
 Once again, I didn't have all information and shared with you an incomplete package for july!  Attached is a spreadsheet with the missing peices.  I promise, we will get this procedure in place once and for all!  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Going to Scottsdale Wednesday night for a little sun, spa, and relaxation!   Have fun in Houston - 
 Darla,  I made a few changes to this spreadsheet.  Please discard the other one that you have.  Thanks,  Kim 
 are you there today?  what's your storage number? 
 How is 1:30 today in Stacy's office for the conference call with Hesco?  I 've left a message with them and asked them if this time was ok.  Will let you know if they are good with it once I hear from them.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Here is Pasadena's nomination summary for Sept.  Let me know if you need anything else!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Ellen,  Attached is the confirmation for sept. for the city of pasadena prepared by legal.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hi Steve,  Just wanted to update the status with the ISDA.  I believe that you have received a copy of the new draft with all of the changes that we've agreed to.  If you guys approve of this draft, we can have an executable copy drawn up and sent to you.  As for the outside council opinion, Sara Shackleton is out of the office until next tuesday and her assistant doesn't know how to proceed with this process.  We will have to wait for Sara's return in order to facilitate that process.  I have sent her an email so that we can get started right away.  Let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or if you have any questions.  I do hope you are able to enjoy the long weekend!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sara,  Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks for your help,  Kim 
 Lou,  Our price indications for PG&E City Gate delivery for 18 and 21 mos out of October, 2001 are $3.78.  For the term June, 2003 through July 2006, it is $3.97.   Please call me if you have any questions or need additional pricing.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Hey Steve,  I'm still waiting on info from Stacy regarding adding language to your contract.  Just wanted to keep you posted.  If I don't talk to you, have a great long weekend and I will talk to you on Tuesday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Tom,  Hello.  Are you still heading to houston?  My cell phone is 713-412-4571.  Call me (or email me) and let me know what your plans are and if you still want us to meet you out.  I will probobly bring Kim one with me.  We'll buy you a congratulatory drink!  Hope to see tomarrow!  Kim 2 
 Send me your phone list as soon as you get a chance - my fax is 713-464-2391, phone 30685. THanks,  Kim 
 Hi guys,  Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.  I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Let me know when you find out.  Have a good day!  K. 
  j., attached are contracts that I was discussing with you this morning.  If we were to attempt to transact with these counterparties, short term or long term,  what were we need to have in place to do so?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Stacy,  I left you a message but wanted to send you a note too.  I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?  Let me know how things look for you as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Kim

 PG&E City Gate is the delivery point and lets start out with $.05. 
 Jason,  I need your help on 2 EASY things -  1)  I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.  United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.  What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?  And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.  2)  THIS IS REAL DEAL:  Merced Irrigation District.  They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.  I gave them an indication of $3.85.  I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.  Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?  They were concerned about what credit would require.  Please let me know as soon as possible!  I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sure!!  Jeff at Merced said to tell you not to stay late!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Stacy,  This looks good to me.  Are there any of these issues that we would be flexible on?  Thanks for your help,  Kim 
  this is a copy of the letter legal is planning to send to Hesco regarding L-T contract recommendations.  They have a copy of master enfolio agreement.  Any comments?  Kim 
 Eric,  Attached is a spreadsheet with the price indications you asked for.  I hope it is helpful.  Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I just got your documents.  Call me. 
 No problem - left a message for Steve Lins but never heard from him.  Will probobly send him an email today.  Thanks,  Kim 
 We are going to get thsi Merced deal done! 
 Are you going to send the letter our or email it or do I need to do anything?  thanks for your help,  Kim 
 Call or come by when you get a chance - I have a question on the blend & extend  Thanks,  Kim 
 Go to www. unitedcogen.com 
 Steve,  It appears as though the outside council opinion is no longer keeping us from completing the ISDA.  If you guys are ok with the current language, we can send you an executable copy and you guys can sign and send back with all of the documents that are required according to the ISDA.  We are prepared to provide you with our documents and will send them with the executable copies of the ISDA.  Call me when you get a chance and let me know what your status is.  I think Barry and I will be in So. California the 17th and 18th.  If you have some time, we would like to stop by and see you guys.  Just let me know when you are available.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Gentlemen,  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Mike,  I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.  It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.  (I will be out Monday)  Have a great weekend!  I hope this is helpful.  Kim 
 Sara,  I am in Denver at an offsite but will be back in the office tomarrow.  Glendale left me a message on Friday that they are ready for an executable ISDA agreement.  I left you a message earlier but wanted to make sure you got it.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  My cell phone number is 713-412-4571.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Mark,  The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.  Thanks for your inquiry -  Kim Ward 
 Hey,  did you call me this morning?  Sorry I missed it if you did.  Been running around like crazy - currently missing presentations trying to close a small (very!) deal.  If I don't talk to you, good luck with your pitch to your customer!  I hope you get the deal!  Talk to you later,  Kim 
 They keep calling.  What do we need to do right now to do the Amgen blend and extend, either paper work or additional collateral?  Let me know soon.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hello everyone,  I got an email yesterday from Jack confirming our meeting on Monday at 2 p.m.  In light of the recent tragic events and the chaotic state that the commercial airline industry is in, Barry and I will not be traveling to California next week.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  We do plan to come out to California to see you guys at a later date.  Once things have settled down and we are able to re-schedule, we will be in touch.  Steve, I am working with Legal to have executable documents sent to you and will keep you posted.  Thanks again for your patience.  Please call me if any of you need anything or have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Just got my fourth phone call this morning - what do we need to do to blend amgen?  Kim 
 Jack,  I have been unable to get this message to Larry.  Would you make sure he gets it for me?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Marie,  Please fax the ISDA documents to Steve Lins, city attorney, city of glendale, fax # 818-547-3402.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 I am sure that Ann took care of this last week because some confirms were generated that came across my desk.  Let me know if there is anything I can do.  Thanks, Kim 
 Stephanie and I talked about this as well - I think lunch today would be a good send off and a wedding gift on his return would be in order. 
 Sara,  I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hey Sally,  sorry you are missing your trip to TN.  Are you going to the Italian fest?  I am thinking about it.  Here are my vitals:  Kim Ward 3110 Lake Street Houston, TX  77098 713-526-7117  cell = 713-412-4571 
 Chris,  I have set up a tentative conference call with John cogan for 10 a.m. CDT/8 a.m. PDT tomarrow.  Is this time good for you?  If not, please let me know what time is good for you.  I think John is pretty flexible as he is hanging out in New Orleans.  thanks,  kim 
 Jason,  palo Alto is asking for their Oct load forcast today in order to realign their supplies.  could you get this for me ASAP?  Let me know if there is a problem.  They are waiting on this to transact.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Tony,  Attached is my response to your RFP on behalf of Noresco.  As noted in our conversation earlier today, I apologize for the tardiness of my response.  I do hope that you will consider our proposals along with the other responses that you received.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713-853-0685.  Sincerely,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination

Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay i= n Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.  As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really clo= se to me was killed.

Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 = am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had= that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him= .  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is ve= ry sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are= doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make = me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that th= is thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most = things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freed= om were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in= and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be d= one to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away = to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that a= ttitude! =20  Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing th= e same - just here in ugly Houston for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba = for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of= the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go= back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!  Take care,  Love, K2  ps.  I have another email address at home.

 Can I sell Hesco Socal index for 300/d Oct through june 02? 
  Lynn,  Attached are confirms for September and October.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  thanks,  Kim 
 so what does this guy do for Burbank and why do they pay him the "big bucks"???? 
 Jim,  I am very interested in supplying your gas and plan on responding to your request for qualification.  If there is anything else that you need in the meantime, please give me a call.  Thanks,  Kim 713-853-0685 
 Jay,  We have been short listed on an rfp for Noresco, a power plant developer.  Attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project.  They plan to refresh prices and perhaps transact this week.  they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.  I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.  I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.  It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.  CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??  PLEASE?  I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!)  Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!  thanks,  Kim 
 The weekend was VERY good!  But - the weekend is the past.  Who knows what the future brings!   Even so - in your searching, you might find someone better than me!  But, if I am still unattached, I will be there!  K. 
 Call me if you have any questions.  Kim  THANKS!!!!]] 
 Chris,  The package you sent me was delayed due to weather - I should get it in am. 
 Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -  K. 
 That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.  K.  ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool! 
 I think I would like santa clara first.  when you get the chance. 
 Phil,  Attached is a draft Natural Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement.  My apologies for taking so much time.  I hope it is not too late.  Please call me with any questions and if we need to, I can get credit on the phone.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Mike,  Attached are Palo Alto's historical loads, which have been verified with Palo Alto.  If you would like to see a different format, let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa Clara, also known as Silicon Valley Power.  We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.  Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda?  Let me know if you have any quesitons.  Thanks,  Kim 
  what do you guys think about this one?  Jay, we have talked about them before I think.  Can I get a response in order to put this away or pursue?  thanks,  Kim 
 1) hesco additional collateral 2)Noresco - they want to focus on 10 or 20 years - can we get there? 
 I don't have their financials but lets get started on what we can get started with. I am not expecting to do financial swaps in the immediate term but I would like to be preparted when we are ready.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  Attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about.  The market it down today so they may appear to be a little high.  I am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed.  Please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs.  I would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together.  In order to do so, we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an ISDA master swap agreement in place.  One thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you.  Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be in touch with the transport structure.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 when is the meeting and where?  thanks,  Kim 
 Just talked to Noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared.  They want to do a 20 year, fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price.  All other gas outside the 10% swing will be priced at Gas Daily +/- $.05.  We are adding a $.25 premium on the 10% swing and the baseload is approximately 1000/day.  If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal, they would like to see what those are - that might sway them.  Jay, I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal.  And they have asked me for this credit information twice today.  It's all about you!!  Thanks a million for your help!  Kim 
 lose this email address!  your site has been blocked by my company and I can not remove as described below. 
 no.  I will try to investigate today. 
 Steve,  Attached are form certificates that you can use for the first two documents required to be included with your executed ISDA.  I hope these are helpful - please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.  Thanks,  Kim 
 They are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from Noresco as soon as they can.  They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.  Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?  Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable. what do you think?  I will keep you posted on discussions.  Thanks!  Kim 
 Antoher thing they brought up was locking in physical basis only.  How does this affect credit?  Thanks again,  Kim 
 VERY Cool!  I will keep you posted on the structure that we are focusing on.  Right now it is Nymex + physcial basis.  They will lock in basis but not Nymex.  We can talk about the potential risks there if you want.  Kim 
 Thanks Mike, we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.  Thanks,  Kim 
 hey Amy, Could you add Art Avalos ( aavalos@pnm.com <mailto:aavalos@pnm.com>) to your price sheet email list?  Let me know if you have a problem!  Thanks,  Kim 
 The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.  Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!! 
 Steve,  Attached are form certificates that you can use for the first two documents required to be included with your executed ISDA.  I hope these are helpful - please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Mike,  We still haven't heard from Dave - he may be wondering who Jason Williams from Enron is.  If you guys could work him from you end, it could speed things up.  Thanks for your help,  Kim 
 You're welcome - It should be fun!  Kim 
 we are VERY close!  when were you here?  and why are you slummin on the gas floor so much? 
 you goin? 
 Hello again,  Now that air travel is somewhat back to normal, Barry and I are rescheduling our trip to Southern California.  It is my understanding that the ISDA itself has been executed and required attachments are in the process of being gathered.  Therefore, you will soon have the option of transacting with Enron financially.   We are available to meet with you at any time on October 11th.  Please let me know if and when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  Again, we look forward to meeting with you and exploring new opportunities.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 ok, I was wondering if you came to work today.  I certainly didn't want to!  still sorry to hear about your deal.  I hope things get better! 
 here are our curves for san juan for the last couple of months.  You make the chart - I was not successful.  Also, I have attached a storage chart.  let me know what else you need.  K. 
 my friend Shannon is coming over at about 6:30 and we are going out - somewhere.  what are you doing? 
 Chris,  this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.  Kim 
 Do you think it would be beneficial for me to go to WSPP? 
 oops - it's ksward63 
 Chris,  Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans. the main issue is as follows:  1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.  I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.  I am working with Darla and Ann to get the orig granted.  thanks,  Kim 
 went this morning - did you go? 
 Any word on Noresco?  Just got a call - 
 Darla,  Attached is a spreadsheet we prepared that details August business with Citizens regarding the Griffith deal.  Please use this to prepare your invoice.  Also, please inform me if they do not pay us by the due date.  John Cogan should not be paid until we get paid by Citizens.  Please call me and we can discuss the spreadsheet as there are cells that must be verified against the TW invoice as well as Sitara.  In addition to billing Citizens, the following entries need to be made each month:  1)  payment to John Cogan 2)  origination to Kim Ward and Chris Foster (50/50) 3)  payment to EARMS for the $.02 insurance Chris negotiated  These amounts are dealed in the last three columns of the spreadsheet.  There may be some updates to the spreadsheet that will create some prior adjustments but these should be ironed out soon.  Call me when you get a chance.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Jim,  Could you send an electronic version of the latest RFP you sent out?  I am having some people help me internally and an electronic version would be helpful.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Jay,  A couple of weeks ago I asked you to review the City of Las Cruces and let me know if we have an enfolio or if we have sent them a draft.  Could you let me know where we stand with that?  I need to respond to them by Monday, the 8th.  thanks,  Kim  PS  Also, I know you sent Debra a request for an Enfolio for IID but I never received a copy.  Did you? 
 Hi guys,  Could we provide a price indication to PNM for a physical call option (offer) for Cal 02 and Q3, 2002 for San Juan gas?  Let start with $.50 out of the money and $1.00 out of the money.  This would be a monthly option.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Art,  We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions -  1)  Is this physical or financial 2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call 3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be?  Thanks,  Kim  ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying to work around some meetings etc. 
 Hi Jeff,  Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:  Q4, 2001                			    $11.70 2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80 5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85 Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38  I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.  Regards,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Can you price that physical call for PNM at the money and $.50 out of the money instead of what I previously requested?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Art,  The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day delivered @ San Juan would be $.48.  For Q3 only, the premium would be $.49.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have questions or need anything else.  I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hello again,  I talked to Mary Jo yesterday and exchanged emails with Tricia - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If Tricia didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  I do wish you would come down here with Jeff sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  Jeff could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!  Yes - I am still hanging out with Pete.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun!  Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!  Love, Kim 
 Saw you at the baseball game last night.  Credit being all work and no play is just not true! 
 What do you know about Panda Resources?  Nothing in a rush right now but I am showing them 10 year prices for their plant in AZ.  I would, however, like to be prepared to do bidness!  Let me know what you need.  Thanks,  Ki. 
 Don,  Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager West Gas Origination 
 Art,  It looks like I won't be able to make it.  I have some meetings set up that I seem to be unable to re-arrange.  I really appreciate the invite though.  Maybe next time.  However, I am going to try to make it to Albuquerque before the end of the year.  I will let you know what my plans are.  Thanks again for the invitation.  Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  Kim 
 Hi David,  I got your name from Don Black as the replacement for Roger Ponce.  I am on the West Gas Origination desk for ENA in Houston and often run across customers looking for gas supply, particularly in California, that would be considered retail customers.  I am forwarding a request I received this morning that EES might be interested in.  I will continue to forward such information to you unless you let me know you are not the person I should be contacting.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Craig,  If the file is a small blue box with deal numbers and prices, I can open it.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Ann,  I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:  1400 Smith Street, EB3206a Houston, TX  77002  Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Debra,  A couple of weeks ago, Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet to you to prepare an Enfolio agreement for Imperial Irrigation District.  I will be forwarding an RFP response to them Friday which is required to include our draft contract.  I haven't received a copy of this draft.  Could you forward this to me at your earliest convenience?  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Kelli,  When you have a chance this morning, can we update the blend and extend with Merced?  Still an indication.  They will transact at some point, maybe not until next week but they will do something.  They are leaning towards this blend though.  thanks for your help,  Kim 
 thanks! Kim 
 Steve,  Attached is a little presentation detailing our proposal for some El Paso capacity that I previously mentioned to you.  Once you have a chance to look it over, give me a call and we can discuss your interests, what would make the proposal more attractive for Santa Clara, and any questions that you might have.  Also,  did you receive my indications for the products you were interested in?  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Some of these are pretty funny. 
 From Fuller - 
 Jeff,  Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January, 2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you need -  Thanks,  Kim 
 Let me know if you need anything else -  Kim 
 Let me know if you need anything else -  K. 
 Monica,  Let's talk once you get a chance to review.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Laird,  City of Corona California planning for form a muni utility and purchase power generators.  Article in today's NGI.  Let's get 'em!  K. 
 Steve,  Attached is a draft copy of our master purchase/sale contract that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will have my legal department standing by to assist.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 variable is all we reimburse them for - they are responsible for the demand.  Let me know if you need anything else with regards to the redwood capacity  Thanks,  Kim 
 Kelli,  Could you (or someone) price up an @ the money call option for 1500/day (physical) at Malin for July - October, 2004?  Please let me know if you have any questions!  thanks,  Kim 
 monthly would be correct!  Thanks! 
 Sara,  Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.  1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this?  2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice?  When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.  Thanks for your help,  Kim 
 Glendale's City Attorney is Steve Lins.  His phone number is 818-548-2080 and his email is slins@ci.glendale.ca.us.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I will be in their offices on Wednesday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Is this to obtain outside opinion?  I thought we were going to do that at our own expense. 
 I will work on this for you - and will be in touch.  Thanks! 
 Steve,  could you provide the name, phone number, etc. of your bond council for our attorney, Sara Shackleton?  Thanks,  Kim 
  Sara,  FYI, how do we proceed?  Kim 
  Barry,  I haven't had a chance to review this but I will when I get in.  Thanks, Kim 
 Chris,  Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.  Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.  Have a good weekend -  Kim Ward 
 call me 
 I am back in the office - we are having a conference call this afternoon to iron out the last calculation questions and you will get a final spreadsheet for August and September from Mara Bronstein.  I have not talked to Sarabeth as you have the only copy of the invoice that I had.  Have you talked to Bryce about that invoice?  What do you guys need in order to pay them?  Thanks, Kim 
 Sounds good to me!  Just let me know what time.  You gonna work out? 
 I will be happy to cruise the mall with you - as long as we don't go on halloween! Have a great afternoon and I will see you later! K. 
 Kelli,  While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.  I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.  thanks, Kim 
 Hey, just workin and playin.  No planned vacations!  What's new with you?  How's work?  Things here have slowed down somewhat.  Hope that's not a bad sign for next year!  What have you been up to?  Haven't seen you about town at all. 
 socal border.  Thanks for your help  Kim 
 Hey!  Glad to hear you are well.  I have thought about our days on the 92nd floor as well.  Had some acquaintances that worked for Cantor as well as a close friend who worked for them that was called back to Houston for a meeting that very morning. Very glad he is with us today!  It is cool that you hired Palmore.  You will have to tell him hello for me.  I did come back to Houston in January.  Enron brought me back to peddle gas in the West US.  Nothing much new in my life, just a new house and job - but I am glad to be back.  I miss the outdoor life in Portland but the people here are so much more fun and nice!  If you are ever in town - you better have a beer with me!  I will let you know if I am in Dallas - Take care,  Kim 
 I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I am usually open - let me know.  Kim 
 Jeff,  A 10 year fixed price indication at the PG&E City Gate out of Jan. 02 is approximately $3.32.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know how I can help facilitate the blend with Merced.  Let me know if there is any thing else that you need.  thanks,  Kim 
 Roger,  I don't know if you are the one to send this to but i am starting with you - let me know what we can do to take care of this EES customer.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Darla,  Could you please remit to John Cogan $749.9 for a brokering fee due him related to sales to Citizens Utilites for July, 2001.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 David,  Here is another possible retail deal in Cali.  Good Luck!  Kim 
 Sent to David Hensel, Director of West Marketing for EES.  He will probobly delegate it.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sara,  Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?  Thanks,  Kim 
 J.,  I am attaching proforma statements for the 2 Panda projects in Arizona.  Hopefully we can put together a credit worksheet and send them a contract. (At least that's where I think we are!)  Any news on SRP or NCPA?  Thanks,  Kim 
 J.,  Sorry, I sent the other email before I got this one.  The contact that I would recommend at NCPA is Dean Park, 916-781-4224.  He will either help you or can direct you to someone else.  You can reference the RFP if you would like.  You are right, NCPA is a consorsium of Munis.  The ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the Cities of Roseville, Lodi, Lompoc, and Alameda. The transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 5000/day at city gate for 2002-2004.  We would be buying back $3.37 Physical BASIS for 2002.  This would be a sort of blend and extend.  Our deal would be Physical Basis.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks, Beth.  Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any questions.  I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new contracts.  If you guys need anything   while we are waiting on those, please let me know!  Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.  Thanks,  Kim 
 David,  I got a phone call from Summit energy, through whom I supply full requirements gas to Smurfit Stone Container Corporations plants in southern California.  Smurfit has a couple of plants in El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Union System, that Summit is looking to obtian bids for.  The contact at Summit is Jason Ramsey and his number is 502-429-3800.  Their load is about 100,000 MMBtu annually.  Is there someone at EES that would be interested in working on this transaction?  Let me know if EES is not interested and I will let Jason know.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
  Mara,  Here is the proposed revised contract with Citizens.  Could you take a look at it and see if the logic works in accordance with the spreadsheet?  sort of like how you built the original spreadsheet from the original contract.  Let me know if you have any questions and how this turns out.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I got the agreement this morning but they misspelled Roseville!!  I am having them change it and will email it to you when I get it.  Do you want me to send you a hard copy or is an email version ok with you?  Let me know -  Thanks,  Kim  PS How are things? 
 Kelli,  Attached is a request from PNM for an indication for the price of a put for Q3 next year.  This is a physical option that is at the money.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Art,  We have priced these at the money puts and they are kind of expensive.  For the monthly put, Strike of $2.72, premium would be $.495.  For the Daily put, the premium would be $.535.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Prices might be lower tomarrow given the downturn since AGA's came out.  If you are willing to look at out of the money puts, the price would be better as well.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Susan,  Sorry this has taken so long but attached is my first cut at a term sheet for Exide Technologies.  Please call me with any questions or comments.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Susan,  Call me if you need anything.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I will be traveling to Arizona for meetings next Tuesday and will be meeting with Salt River Project.  I would like to be able to take our ISDA comments with me.  Where do we stand with this?  thanks,  Kim 
 Hey Lyndon,  How are you?  Long time - no email!  I hope things are going well for you.  Went to Happy Hour with Kim 1, Susie, Stacy, and Melissa last night.  Susie and Stacy just got back from the Bahamas.  Kim 1 and Melissa left today for Cabo San Lucas.  As for me, I am painting the inside of my house.  Not nearly as much fun.  But with this economy combined with my company's 3rd quarter earnings - my net worth is the worst it has been in YEARS!!!!  In other words - I am poor!  Anyway, we were talking about our upcoming trip on the Poly in January and we were all wondering (especially me) if you had decided to remain in Austrailia or rejoin Casey on the boat.  I think we all hope we see you in Jan!  Gotta go back to work and try to get this stock price back up - take care, keep in touch, and let me know what fun things you have been up to!  Love, K2 
 Darla is ready to bill citizens for Sept.  I guess we can use Cogans sheet if we are comfortable it is correct.  Let me know if you need anything and when you think we can get this to Darla.  ]  Thanks,  Kim 
 Lynn,  Attached is the confirm for November.  Let me know if you have any questions or problems.  Thanks,  Kim

 Kelli,  Could you send me the NCPA worksheet?  thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  Can you send a template of the GISB agreement to this guy?  thanks,  Kim 
 Hey guys - it looks like NCPA got our proposal and would like for us to refresh by 9 am PPT tomarrow morning.  That is 11 our time.  Jay, where are we with credit and contracts.  I think we need to have this done today.  Can you let me know what our status is?  Barry is asking me.  Kelli, can we refresh in the morning fairly quickly?  I would love to get this deal done.  Tomarrow, we need to add a little orig!  Please let me know if any of you have any questions.  thanks,  Kim 
 Let's talk about that.  I want to get the deal and make as much money as possible!!!  So I would like to test it out and see what seems reasonable.  thanks,  Kim 
 of course - where do you want to meet? and what time? 
 Amy,  Could you remove Jan Kennedy from your email list (City of Mesa) and add clifford_cauthen@ci.mesa.az.us <mailto:clifford_cauthen@ci.mesa.az.us>?  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 J.,  what is the status of this?  Mark Russell called again this morning for status.  I think he talked to Bill.  Please let me know.  thanks,  Kim 
 tomarrow is fine.  Talk to you then.  Kim 
 We could meet at my house and sit on my patio.  I should stick around until 5:30 or so.  I could be home by 5:45 or 6.  Is that cool? 
 The physical basis offer indication for Dec - March at the City Gate is about $.32.  The fixed price indiation for the 38 month period you mentioned is approximately $4.39.    We need to discuss this structure in detail if you are serious about buying physical gas from us and we also need to get contracts in place. Let me know if there is anything else you need.  thanks,  Kim 
 where will you be coming from?  If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the people gate code is c1984.  See you then -  Kim

 Dan,  El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.  Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.  Kim 
 It is right behind 3112.  There are only 3 garden homes inside the gate - and 3110 is real big on my double green doors.  Call if you get lost - 713-412-4571.  Kim

 Please call me when you get a chance.  I have a question.  thanks,  Kimmie x30685 
 Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - -  I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.  Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!  Keep in touch - K. 
 Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.  Funny how things can change in just one week!  Suzanne is awesome - don't know what I would do without her.  We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.  Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.  (See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)  Take care and keep in touch.  kim 
 He is canadian.  Did you meet him?  What's going on this week? 
 Chris,  Can you send or fax me a copy of the contract between us/Citizens and EARMS?  I don't have a copy and i need one in order to get these invoices processed.  thanks,  Kim 
 Lynn,  I thought you might be interested in the new draft proposal for the QFs in Cali.    Kim 
 PLEASE take me with you.  I am at a low in my life - recently reassured that I am a failure in relationships that really mean something to me.  The only point in my life where I can't seem to be successful. 
 Please remind me of the exact changes so I can go to my back office.  Things have just been crazy around here so sorry for overlooking this.  '  Thanks,  Kim 
 Art,  We are pricing the calls up for you and will have them in the morning.  As for the comments on the contract, you can send them to me and I will put them in our lawyers hands.  Thanks so much for getting that document throught the system.  I will talk to you tomarrow.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I found it!  It was in a box in my garage.  Thanksgiving was just ok - have had better.  how was yours and what did you do this weekend? 
 came back from dallas friday - just went to houstons with a friend.  Saturday, worked on the house and ran some errands.  Went out saturday night and drank too much - just hung out yesterday.  Nothing at all exciting!  I am very boring these days! 
 I went to this party with my friend Brad Fagan - we ended up at this loud bar and ran into P. - It wasn't much fun. 
 yes - he's always nice. 
 Here are my updates,  Kim 
 Did you go this morning?  If not, do you want to go after work? 
 thanks for the look 
 please remove my email address from your distribution list. 
 Megan,  Are we going to owe Pasadena money for every invoice?  If not, since we owe them so much on this one, is there a way we can offset with future invoices where they owe us money?  Can we check into that?  Let me know -  Kim 
 check this out - can you tell I am bored? 
 Wht do you think?  I was really bored today 
 how's this 
   Suzanne,  can you forward to Lori and Joe Gordon.  Terri,  Can you forward to Pierce, Stacy, and Donna? 
 you still here? 
 please remove my email address from your distribution list. 
 Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?  And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help me put together the confirmation?  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems.  All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have.  I have no idea what flows.  I hope Patti can help you soon.  Let me know if you don't hear from her today.  Thanks,  Kim 
 thats fine - we can't pay them anyway 
 Are you going to hang out with me and Camille tonight? 
 Jack,  Thanks so much for the message.  You are right, we are still a great trading organization.  Unfortunately, we had some people outside this organization make mistakes.  As for Tuesday, lets play it by ear.  I think we will continue to be a business and I still consider you a great customer.  Call me when you get into town and I will have a lot more information to share.  Thanks again for your email -  Kim 
 This makes 8 
 why are they doing this? 
 So do we have a special agreement in place for the full requirements gas deal?  I think that you did that deal before I came to the gas desk.  How can I get a copy of the penalty language?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Please remove me from your email distribution list. 
 Mr. Dossett,  I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!  And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win?  Kim 
 Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim

 Dan Hyvl - we sent them a draft two/three weeks ago. 
 Bob,  I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.  Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 I told you 
 As you probobly knew, Camille is gone.  I missed working out with Dean this morning - oh well.  Thought you might want to know about Camille. 
 e.  Here's my stuff - 3110 lake St. Houston, 77098.  713-526-7117.  kward1@houston.rr.com.  Good Luck and please keep in touch.  Kim

 I'm fine so far - just looking for a job .  How are you? 
 Kathy,  I would like to change my United Way contribution for 2002 to $0.  Please let me know what information you need to make this change.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
  Jeanie,  I would like to change my United Way contribution to zero and it looks like Kathy is no longer with us.  Who should I send my request to at this point?  Thanks,  Kim 
 did you put that on my desk? 
 Cliff,  For gas day December 6, 2001, Enron did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.  I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.  Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.  The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.  Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 AS we discussed. 
 Some of you may have gotten a similar email before but it seems as though it is appropriate once again - I just wanted to pass on my personal information so that any of you can get in touch with me through a mean others than Enron -  3110 Lake Street Houston,TX  77098 713-526-7117 (home) 713-412-4571 (cell) kward1@houston.rr.com  Please keep in touch!

 Is this a new email address for you? 
 But Oregon would be eaten alive by Miami - they haven't played anyone this year.  Just got a call about a power originator job in Denver.  Interesting! 
 hello 
 Lou,  I am still here but I am unable to give out quotes at this time.  Please accept my apologies and I will be in touch once things are straightened out around here.  Kim 
 I faxed these documents to you earlier.  If you did not get them, please let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Garrett,  I do have E.'s home email address - emainzer@attbi.com.  Thought you might like it.  Talk to you soon!  Kim 
 Ann,  Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.  The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.  Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685

 Megan,  Mara has been terminated so I looked in our files and found a spreadsheet for November.  However, it doesn't have the volumes filled in. Shannon Groenewald should be able to provide you with the actual volumes and all you should have to do is add them to this spreadsheet.  I have copied Shannon on this email so she should expect to hear from you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 It was painful !  Actually made it through an airplane flight, 2 meetings, a reception, and dinner!! 
 Yonnie,  I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!  We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!  Talk to you later -  Love,  Kim 
 check out the following websites for airfare:  www.orbitz.com - the best so far. www.cheaptickets.com www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer  register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform  Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.  Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.  Don't forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter)  p.s.  If you want to see how UN attractive my friends are - we are going to be a the wine bucket (new place - W. Alabama just east of Kirby) at 6 pm tonight.  Suzanne, Camille, Jeanie, Lori, Elizabeth.  You can check Camille out for yourself.  Bring others along.

 We are not authorized marketer - only agent.  In other words, we are scheduling for them but not supplying their gas.

 Art,  Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  Barry and I have discussed San Juan risks but we are willing to take it - however, the actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the Blanco Pool.

Thanks for thinking of me and for the invitation.  Maybe some other weekend - I do hope to see you again soon.  Kim 
 Darla,  As far as I can tell, Craig's requests are ok.  Also, the NSP and gelber invoices you sent me look ok.  I am attaching my manual spreadsheet for the deals I have done from August forward.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Remember to use this spreadsheet in conjunction with what is in the system.  Mara,  I am just sending you this spreadsheet.  This has nothing to do with the Griffith deal.  We can discuss later.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chino plant 100% down = 80 MW Bagdad plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw Cerrito plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw  Basically 120 -150 MW offline due to PDs decrease in producion.  the same percentage decrease in gas demand is what we should see.  Let me know if you would like us to investigate this further.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks, Kim - for always sending me my stray emails!  Have a good day (or night)  Kim 
 Karla,  Have you received these confirms yet?  Please let me know.  thanks,  Kim

  are you trying to confuse my customer? 
 J.,  Where are we with this process?  Did you ever get whatever info Sara needed to her?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Since I have my long vacation in January, the less time I have to take off, the better - so I think a long holiday weekend would be good.  Let me know!  Kim 
 chris,  Here is what is going on with Citizens right now:  1)  Mike Grigsby and Randy Gay are reviewing the revisions to the Griffith contract from their perspective.  I will have Patti review it once they are done.  I looked at your peaking language and was not able to enhance it.  However, does the new calculation address any unanticipated pipeline rate changes such that the demand margin or sales margin could be negetive? 2)  interuptible gas will flow right now to Nogales from the Waha pool, according to Pattie 3)  I am attaching a summary of the conference call we had on the 18th and would like your input before sending it out. 4) the capacity release was posted and matched successfully.  Let me know ifyou have any questions.  thanks,  Kim 
 Hey Jeanie,  thanks for the invite.  Please keep me posted.  Last night was fun.  Had just the right amount of trick or treaters to have one piece of candy left over for each of us!  Kimmie 
 are we going to work out with Dean tomarrow? 
 when? 
 ok 
  Gentlemen,  I haven't heard from anyone regarding LDWP's request listed below.  We have to reply by next week. What is the status?  There is an article in the NGI publication today.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kim 
 Chris,  If you have a minute, will you look at this term sheet?  His volumes are really small but if we get the Palo Alto deal it won't be that big of a deal - unless we have to schedule less than 1 MMBtu. Oh yo!  His average daily volume, for both plants is about 178/day, based on annual usage.  I have proposed basically a GD deal with a first of the month index option if he can set a BDQ.  Thanks in advance.  Kim 
 I forgot to mention that Scott Masuda of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power will be in our offices on Monday afternoon.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Gerald,  I sent the following email to Jeff Hodge and Jason Williams on October 25th ad have heard nothing.  I reminded them this morning as we need to reply by mid next week.  Also, LDWP will be in our offices Monday afternoon.  Is this something that you can address faster than Jeff?  If so, just let him know and let me know how to proceed.  There was an article in the NGI publication this morning regarding this.  Thanks,  Kim 
 You're welcome.  I hope all is going well with you. 
 I did know all of that - talked to her just the other day.  I will miss her too!  Let me know if, when you need anything.  Kim 
 lets go now 
 Hello.  sorry I missed you last night ( and Saturday night!)  That football game I watched had 7 (a record) Overtimes!  The game lasted until about 10:30 and my team lost.  Very sad.  JDA and I went to Berryhill to meet Matt last night and I thought you would be there.  Is everything OK with you?  K. 
 attached are my changes 
 Sure you can stay at my house!  I will try to join you Thursday nite as well.  Things have been pretty shitty lately - with work, with the love life, and a huge sinus infection.  Hopefully things will be looking up by then!  Please make yourself at home!  You can come and go as you need.  Kim 
 I will try to make it.  Stewart and Paul Choi (PDX office) are suppose to be here but that may change.  Either way, I will try to make it.  Kim

 Hey,  how was your weekend in Phoenix?  Hope it was good!  Are we still on for tonight?  K. 
 Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches!  Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.  K.

 Houston has actually been nice - hasn't gone above 85 and it is great to sit outside at night.  Anyway, you work too much and need to think about getting a life!!  We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.  I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!  Take care,  Kim 
 Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.  Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
  Please change your address book to include kim ward in houston and not kim e. ward in london.  She continues to have to forward these emails to me.  If you have questions, please call me at x30685.  Thanks,  Kim

 Brenda,  Attached are the price indications that you requested.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685

Donations can be made to - just kidding!  Hope all is well with all of you!  Kim  kward1@houston.rr.com

 THank you!!!

 I don't know what to do.  Boss says I don't need to look for a job and they will have to find some $$ to keep people. don't know that I want to be among the 7000 enron employees beating the streets.   Any suggestions?  there have been no formal announcements of layoffs but Logically, I feel like about 50% of my friends here will loose their jobs.  Especially the ones not associated with gas or power.  The world is in turmoil!  Wish I had my sailboat and 6 mos. $$ to live on - I would go to the caribbean and stay for a while. 
 Hi Joan - yes it is me, your long lost cousin!  You probobly got my address off of something that my mom sent around.  How are things with you?  As you probobly knew, I am back in Houston - which is very good as my company just announced a merger on Friday.  Worried about many of my friends but I am not so worried about loosing my job.  The world is certainly in turmoil!  Hope all is well with you and your family.  Keep in touch -  Kim 
 Hey!  The leg is healing nicely, thank you.  It did turn a little blue but I think I will live!  I say we are serious about the party but I have forwarded this to Suzanne to make sure she is on board.  I will keep you posted as things develop!  Hope to see you again soon -  Kim 
 Will you check our systems and invoice for July for the Citizens Griffith deal and let me know what we have billed/paid citizens and PPL for July 17th and July 26.  There are some significant discrepancies with these counterparties that need to be addressed ASAP.  Please let me know what you find.  You can call me at x30685.  thanks,  Kim 
 that is exactly it - and it worked for me today.  kward1@houston.rr.com.  try it again and let me know if you have a problem.  did you have fun with the guy you met out friday?  I would like to visit austin sometime.  Hopefully soon!  Thanks for the offer.  I will be in touch soon - and you are welcome to stay with me anytime!  take care,  Kim 
 Hey Lyndon,  It was nice to hear from you.  We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!  Things here have been changing by the day.  To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that Kim 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!  How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -  Kim 
 Gerald,  Thanks for looking at this for us.  When do you think you will have a chance to review it?  I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.  Also, do we need to have credit re-review?  Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.  Thanks,  Kim 
 MJ,  How are you doing?  Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!  How was your wine tour?  I thought about you guys.  It looked like so much fun!  Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!)  I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.  Let me know what you think!!  And I hope all is going well for you!  Kim 
 El, I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details! Thanks for the invite -  K. 
 I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules! 
 Gerald & Stacy,  I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.  ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.  I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.  Thanks,  Kim 
 el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?  Kim 
 We can come in on Thursday evening (so we can spend friday in the wine country) and leave sunday afternoon at 3:20 for 20000 miles!  So we are definitely in!  What do you think?

 Dear Mr. Lopez,  Attached is Enron North America's response to your RFP request for Natural Gas Supply to Frito-Lay's plants located in California.

 Jay,  Attached is the GTC that El Paso Electric took to the top for approval.  As discussed yesterday, we would prefer to put a Master in place instead of just GTC.  Can we send them a master with the EXACT language?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Mara,  Could you break the attached volumes down to MMbtu/day for each facility as well as total per day?  thanks,  Kim 
 I threw most of mine away - now I will munch on chocolate all afternoon.  At least it tastes better! 
 I think I might show up - was going to work out here but it will be less crowded there.  See you there 
 Thanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -  Kim 
  Rob,  I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.  I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac!  Kim

 I will check on this - also, keep me posted on Conexant and let me know how you want to set it up.  We are busy getting moved onto the new floor.  Kim 
 also, who use to do the smurfit invoice and who is their boss - do you know? 
 Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not = much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a= change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think t= hat there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that par= t.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice. = Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suza= nne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with C= orporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay o= n with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this w= ay, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES= gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Than= ksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip= - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse = to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out wi= th myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?= I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the ho= liday season and time for (good) cheer!  Kim 
 are you talking about JS?  thought she was going to kentucky?  I was going with my friend Elizabeth but she is probobly going to have to work on Friday.  So I may just ride back with her.  Trying to figure it  all out. 
 As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Let's meet today at 3:00 in conference room 6106 to discuss the griffth deal and our reply to citizens.  If you are unable to make it, please let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
  $3.18 plus origination 
 Jim,  Just wondering if you had that list of counselors or if you were interested in setting something up.  Kim 
 Jim,  Attached is Enron's response to your Request for Natural Gas Supply Proposals.    If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 713-853-0685.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Sean,  I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is "assuring me" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.  Thanks,  Kim 
 ok - I am here 
 I'm off my call 
 Terri,  What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.  Let's get together for a beer soon -  Kim 
 Suz,  I say lets do it! and so does Terri.  I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.  I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!  Keep me posted on how your day is going.  I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.  K. 
 Kam,  Thanks so much for your help!  Kim 
 when can we meet today to discuss our written response to Citizens? 
 FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk. 
 Dan,  Just wanted to follow up with you to see how things ended up with your RFP.  I would really like to be the natural gas supplier to your plants in California.  Please call me at your earliest convenience - 713-853-0685.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Brent,  Attached is the confirmation for serving Smurfit's plants in southern California for December 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!  Thanks,  Kim  Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful. 
 if you are on continental, are you flying into IAH?  Maybe that is what I should do and we could take one cab.  what do you think? 
  in the case that you want to call him!  Kim 
 absolutely nothing.  Just working on whatever I can.  very slow.  what about you?  what are you doing thanksgiving?

 Frank,  I just spoke to Jan Kennedy and they are going out for an RFP for their gas supply once our contract with them runs out.  She "recommended" that I tak e a look at your response to the last RFP because it was so good - far surpassing any of the other responses!!  If you still have a copy or a file of that response, would you mind if I took a look at it?  thanks,  Kim 
 Mark,  Attached is a term sheet detailing our proposal.  I have also attached a sample contract which will have credit terms attached once we are able to obtain proper credit information.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685

 Hey,  What's been going on?  Hopefully something besides work!  Finally getting moved in - well - almost.  Still have the junk room!

If you are around, I would love to get together!  Hope all is well -  K. 
 Go anywhere fun?  Please make me jealous!  Things are good - Vanny came back Saturday and started her new gig today.  So, I think a celebration is in order sometime this week.  K. 
 what about those sixers? 
 Jeff,  Attached is the latest Palo Alto document with their red lined comments.  I haven't had a chance to look at them yet but will right now.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Stacy,  I just talked to Palo alto.  They would like to schedule a conference call for tomarrow, noon our time.  I told them it would be up to you.  Please let me know if this gives you enough time.  Thanks,  Kim Ward x30685 
 Jan,  Attached is a graph describing a structure that you guys might also be interested in.  It is a floor and an indexed ceiling around an at the money call.  Give me a call if you are interested and I can go over it with you.  thanks,  Kim

 Scott,  Attached is our physical firm Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for Natural Gas Transactions.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  Once we get this in place, we will be able to enter into any gas transactions and we won't have to worry about contracts.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Of course you can use me as a ref.  And good luck.  I think Barry and I are coming to AZ the 28 - 29.  I know we will be coming to your office so hopefully I wi
