 Dear Mr. Schaeffer,  Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below.  Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the Cogent Communications Advisory Committee.  On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for success.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Patti,  It was good to see you and Mike last night.  I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will do better.  It really is a lot of fun.  Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!  Jeff  PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to you today if you are interested.  Let us know!  Hope all is well... 
 They don't have to be with the others, so this is perfect.  Thanks, Greg.  If it's easier, I can come to you...I know you guys are swamped.  SRS  PS - I didn't realize that I sent you an e-mail from Jeff's box - didn't mean to alarm you if I did! 
 Greg, if there are two more tickets available for sale for Friday's game, I'd like to buy them.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS 
 Mark,  Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once received from the guides.  Please let us know if you're at all interested.  Thanks, Sherri 
 Brad, as I am cleaning out Jeff's e-mails, I came across this one from you. It appears to me that it has not been opened, so I'm checking to find out if you got the answer to your question.  Please let me know, and I'll try to get the information for you.  If we dropped the ball on this, I apologize.  Sherri Sera x3-5984 
 Not necessary yet, Karen, but thanks.  Fitz is out of the office until Monday, so there won't be any action taken until then.  Thanks again, SRS 
 Not a problem, Kimberly.  Thanks for the heads up.  If Franz calls before Monday, I'll transfer him to you.  SRS 
 Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 617.493.5597.  (Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse - i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).  Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to Franz.  SRS  PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his family to Houston... 
 Thank you for the information, Brian.  I'll make sure Jeff sees this.  For your information, should a need arise for you to give Jeff completely confidential information, his voicemail is the only secure means to do so (I do not have his password).  His extension is 3-6894.  Otherwise, all mail (e-mail included) is opened by me.  Again, thank you for your quick response for information.  SRS 
 Dear Mr. Buttrey,  Jeff received your e-mail and asked me to respond on his behalf as he is traveling.  He would really enjoy having lunch with you on your next visit to Houston.  Please give him a call when your plans are firm...he can be reached at 713.853.6894.  Jeff also inquired as to what you are up to these days.  When you have a minute, please drop him another line.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) e-mail: sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Dear Ms. Siska,  On behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling, I am responding to a request from Mr. Warren Staley to forward to you the name of Enron's contact with regard to an information exchange on leadership development between Enron and Cargill. Mr. Skilling suggests that you call Mr. Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff. Mr. Kean can be reached at 713.853.1586 or via e-mail at steven.kean@enron.com.  If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Rachael, well, I was wrong again.  Jeff said he is not interested in doing the morning broadcast with Sam Malone; no reason given, so I didn't ask. Sorry!  SRS 
 Brian, Jeff would like to know who the individual was that was communicating with the OOC.  He doesn't recall this situation - please advise.  Thanks, Sherri x3-5984 
 Samual, Jeff will be happy to take a photo for the Encounter.  Just let me know the details so we can make sure he's where he needs to be at the appointed time.  Good luck with the ride.  Sherri x3-5984 
 Good morning, Yelba.  It has been a long time!  You may not remember me, but I have been working with Jeff since the McKinsey days (my name used to be "Baumbach").  After reviewing your e-mail, Jeff suggests that you speak to Lou Pai, Chairman & CEO of Enron Energy Services; his telephone number is 713.853.5646.  By copy of this e-mail, he is advised that you will contact him.  Good luck with your venture, Yelba, and welcome back to Houston.  If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to call me.  And please tell Richard that we said hello.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) e-mail: sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Mr. Collins,  Mr. Skilling is considering this invitation and has requested a bit more information.  What time are the awards presentations taking place on April 11?  Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April 12  that would be very difficult to reschedule.  Given this time constraint, I'm not sure it will work.  Please advise at your earliest convenience.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 Fax 
 Michael, I'm responding on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who is traveling abroad.  It appears that this is informational only for Jeff, and you are not inviting him to attend the meetings.  If this is an invitation to attend, he is unable to as he will still be traveling abroad.  Sherri 
 Amelia, just wanted to make sure that you had Jeff signed up...I'm sure you probably do!  SRS 
 Hi, Suzanne.  I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate it.  And of course, anything marked "confidential" is opened only by him.  Thanks a lot, Suzanne.  Hope all is well with you.  Sherri 
 Rex, the format you sent the document in will not open for me.  Can you send it as a .ppt document?  Thanks, SRS 
 Karen, thank you for the update.  Please note in future communcations that "McKinzie" is actually spelled "McKinsey."  As Jeff worked there prior to coming to Enron, this is a typo he would notice.  I have changed it in the copy of this message given to him.  SRS 
 Dear Neil,  Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.  In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com

 Thank you, Carrie.  It printed just fine this time.  SRS   Carrie Southard @ ECT   02/07/2000 02:38 PM 
 You're the best!  I owe you one.  Take care, SRS 
 Carrie, is there protection on this report that prevents me from printing it out for Jeff Skilling?  If so, would you please remove it?  I print this for him every day and fax it to him when he's traveling.  Please let me know how I might do that.  Thanks, SRS 
 Mr. Stuart,  Mr. Skilling has reviewed your communications and has determined that Enron is not interested in pursuing at this time.  Thank you for the opportunity.  Regards, Sherri Reinartz-Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 
 Jim, so long as you and Jim Derrick have approved from a legal perspective, Jeff approves.  SRS 
 The attached expense report has been approved.  Please process for payment. Jeff Skilling

 Pam, I was going through Jeff's email and found this.  See below - it looks like this went to Catherine Brown of EES (my name is with a "K").  It looks like Jeff would be available from 2:00 to 3:00.  I will put it on his calendar to attend for one hour.  Is that good for you? Katherine

 Mr. Krings,  I received your voicemail this morning.  On December 3, I forwarded this information to Mr. Mike McConnell, who in turn sent it to Mr. Jay Fitzgerald, Enron's Managing Director of e-Commerce.  He is the appropriate person with whom to follow up.  He can be reached at 713.853.6161.  Regards, Sherri Reinartz-Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 
 Dear Mr. Dillehay,  We are in receipt of the above referenced letter addressed to Mr. Jeff Skilling.  At this time, Enron is not interested in utilizing the services Epsilon provides.

 Dear Sr. Rivera,  I'm writing on behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling in response to your e-mail below.  Mr. Skilling is very interested in meeting with Sr. Rafael Miranda. Unfortunately, he does not have any planned trips to Europe within the next couple of months, though that may change after the first of the year.  If, however, Sr. Miranda has any plans to be stateside, I would be happy to arrange a time for the two of them to meet.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 Sanjay, Jeff asked me to write you to introduce you to Gerald Chan, the brother of Ronnie Chan (ENE director).  Gerald has been investing in capital ventures in the US and Asia for many years.  Of late, he has been running into companies in which Enron is investing or is interested in investing, and Jeff met with him today to discuss this.  Jeff suggested that Gerald contact you to discuss further.  I have provided Gerald with your telephone numbers, address and e-mail address.  You should expect to hear from him shortly.

 Kathy, Mr. Jeff Skilling has an Enron meeting on November 30 that will prevent his participation in the Houston Mentor Network Breakfast. Thank you, Katherine Brown 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee. I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any questions you may have.  To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged. Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.  I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for spending your time on this critical process.  Jeff 
 John, any chance you can sent this e-mail to me?  Apparently it has a "confidential" stamp on it, so even though I have access to Jeff's mailbox, it won't allow me to open it.  Unfortunately, Jeff does not check his own e-mail, and if I go into his machine, I won't be able to print it as it is not connected to any printer.  Thanks, John.  I'll see that Jeff gets it as soon as it's received.  SRS

 Hi, Beek.  I'm going through all of your e-mails to Jeff and am not able to find the information on Elvis' party Friday night.  Someone had sent an attachment with the details, but I was unable to open it.  Would you mind sending us the "final" agenda for the festivities this weekend?  Jeff will arrive in Dallas +/- 4:00p Friday night and will be staying at the Crescent Court hotel. Thanks so much!  SRS

 Stephane, I'll be sending to you today checks totaling $22,063.73, which represents 53% of the $41,386.23 total pledges.  I'll be contacting people today to collect outstanding pledges and will send a "care package" to you daily with what I collect.  SRS 
 Dear Mr. Morgan,  On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he must respectfully decline your invitation.  Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what I can to facilitate that for you.  Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the opportunity.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS 
 Gil,  Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.  It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.  Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-) 
 Thanks for the invitation, Mike, but I will be at a wedding the night of the 28th.  Sounds like a great party - I'm sorry I'll miss it!  Jeff 
 Erica, the phone call on Tuesday, May 15, at 10:00 a.m. (CDT) between Messrs. Murdock and Skilling is confirmed.  Thank you for your patience while we worked this out on our end.

 Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.  Thanks again for your help.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but will return tomorrow morning.  In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense. Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to free up some time.  Thank you.

 Erica,  Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it would be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.  Thanks, Joannie 713-345-7774 
 Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be possible to schedule during the next quarter?  Thanks, Joannie

 Hi, Kristin.  I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch. Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow (Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.  I'll make a reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS  PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do you have it down, too? 
 Karen, heres the version of the PRC memo you should use.  Please call if you have any questions.  SRS 
 Jay,  I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" right - just give me a call when you've got something.  Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.  Best regards, Jeff 
 Thank you for the invitation to Utilities 2001.  Due to a prior commitment, Mr. Skilling is unable to attend.  Regards, Sherri Sera 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com

 Christie, please tell me you don't have Jeff down for this function.  He will be returning to Houston Monday afternoon.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby. Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for Wednesday.  Thanks and have a great weekend.

 The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.  I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.  To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is:  C673EV  To begin the survey, click on the link below: http://63.211.208.100/GLOBENetwork/survey.asp  You may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.

 Good morning, Kristin.  Your Dad would like to meet you today at Maggiano's (located at 2019 S. Post Oak Blvd., 713.961.2700).  I'll make a reservation for 12:00 noon - he'll be there then, and I know you'll probably be a few minutes later than that.  Let me know if you want another plan.  SRS 
 Dave, please disregard my previous e-mail about the date and location in June, unless June 4-7 in Park City, UT, is not it.  As Jeff has to be in Wyoming on the evening of the 7th, it is possible that he speak in Park City that morning and then go on to Wyoming for the dinner he's attending there. I'll be back in touch once Jeff has seen this e-mail and responded with his interest...SRS 
 Dave, do you have a date and location in June?  The month is filling up quickly, but if they can be flexible, we can probably work it out if Jeff is interested.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Thank you for the invitation.  Unfortunately, Jeff Skilling is unable to=20 attend.=20  Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774 
 Confirming 1:00 p.m. meeting on June 12 at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774 
 Jeff Skilling is unable to attend.  Thank you, Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774 
 Kevin, just wanted to let you know that a sedan through Beal's has been reserved and will pick you up at 7:15a at the Four Seasons.  I've asked that the sedan stand by and take you as directed when you are ready to leave the North Shepherd facility.  Regards, SRS 
 Thank you!  SRS 
 Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)? Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was cancelled.  I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from where.  The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.  I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.  Regards, SRS 
 Ok, I'll tell you what I've told everyone else - the pledges Jeff has received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 hours!  SRS 
 Dear David,  Jeff will see your e-mail later today and will respond to your first question as soon as possible.  In the meantime, I'm attaching Jeff's current bio in response to your second question.    Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Thank you, Rod!  SRS 
 Thanks for the message, Tom.  I have visited the Ivory Coast, Togo and Nigeria once;  Tanzania twice; and Kenya and So. Africa three times.  I really love the place and look forward to spending lots more time there.  Thanks, too, for sharing the photos.  Jeff 
 Sam, Jeff said he would be happy to talk with you.  Just look for him in LaGrange late Saturday afternoon.  Good luck on the ride!  SRS 
 How much to you have?!  SRS 
 $50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you. Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS    Enron Energy Services 
 Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS 
 I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!  Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?  Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...  Sherri :-) 
 Stan, Jeff will be travelling the biggest portion of May.  Would you let us know the next time Ali is in the US and I will try to work something out for them to meet.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Gentlemen,  Messrs. Micheal Holthouse and Matt Khourie (Jeff's co-hosts of the April 24 YPO event) invite you to join them at dinner on Monday evening, April 23. Reservations have been made in Matt Khourie's name at Capital Grille, located at 5365 Westheimer Road (in the Galleria area), at 7:00 p.m.  Should you need transportation to the restaurant, I will be happy to make those arrangements for you.

 Greetings, Tom.  I have a great picture of you, Jeff and Jeffrey at the Inauguration that Jeff asked me to send to you.  Unfortunately, I don't have a mailing address for you.  If you would please e-mail me your address, I'll get the picture right out to you.  Thanks, and hope all is well!  SRS 
 Jeff (Rocky) Skilling is not able to attend the football game, but he appreciates you offering to get him a ticket.  He will, however, be at Elvis' party Friday night.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com

 Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your patience.  SRS 
 Diomedes, I have been searching high and low for this information for you, and I think I may have found something.  I have a letter from you to Jeff dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of $110,109.00.  It broadly outlines expenses and references an attached report, which I unfortunately do not have.  Would this letter be of any help to you? Please let me know, and I'll be happy to send it right to where ever you designate.  SRS 
 Thanks for the update, Andrew.  Just let us know if what the ultimate outcome is.  SRS 
 Hamd, would you take the lead on this and keep Jeff posted?  Thanks, SRS 
 Dear Mr. Thornton,  We are in receipt of your letter to Jeff Skilling dated March 30, 2001.  Jeff has been traveling for the past 2 weeks; however, I wanted you to know that your letter was received and that you will receive a response as soon as practical.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I may be of further assistance.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Gentlemen,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling regarding scheduling a 20-minute conference call to discuss the above referenced presentation/panel discussion at the Houston Chapter YPO (Young Presidents Organization) meeting.  Jeff is available the afternoon of Thursday, April 12, between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. (CDT).  Please let me know what your availability is during this time period, and I'll be back in touch to nail down an exact time or to suggest an alternative date/time.  Thank you very much for your commitment to this event and for your patience in awaiting the details.  I look forward to hearing from each of you soon.  Best regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com  Sent to: David Arnoff, Greylock Kevin Compton, KPCB Team Partners John Thornton, Austin Ventures 
 Thank you for the invitation.  Mr. Skilling will be travelling on the 19 and therefore unable to attend.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713-345-7774 713-646-8381 joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the SUN demonstration.  With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.  I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.

 Hello - yes I am one in the same.  It really is a small world.  Though my schedule is pretty hectic right now with travel, etc., give me a call the next time you're in the building.  Maybe we can have a cup of coffee and catch up.  Regards,  Jeff 713.853.6894 
 Patti, can you believe that out of all those dates you offered that Jeff is only available on October 14?!  I have penciled it in on his calendar as has Rebecca.  We'll look forward to more details.  Thanks, and have a wonderful time in Cabo!  I'm so envious!!!  Sherri 
 Ben, I was unable to launch the .pdf file - message said "an application to open this document cannot be found."  I wasn't able to view it, too.  Can you send it in another format?  SRS 
 Stephanie, I was not able to open or view the MS150.pdf file.  Did anyone else have problems?  SRS 
 Thanks, Joan.  I'll have IT look into it.  You can always send an e-mail to the "office of the chairman" e-mail address.  Additionally, Mr. Lay's name in the directory is "Kenneth Lay."  SRS 
 Monica, this looks great.  Thank you.  SRS 
 Mr. Fleisher, we are in receipt of your invitation to Jeff Skilling.  I am forwarded (via this email) your request to Hamd Alkhayat for review and response.  Thank you, Katherine Brown Office of the President & COO Enron Corp. 
 Mr. Dale, thank you for your interest in Enron.  I have forwarded your email to Louise Kitchen, President & CEO of Enron Networks, for her review.  Thank you, Katherine Brown Executive Assistant Office of the President & COO 
 Mr. Roll, we are in receipt of your e-mail.  Katherine Brown will circulate as appropriate tomorrow.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Monica, per our discussion.  I look forward to working with you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Mr. Portwood, we have forwarded your email to Dan Leff, President & CEO of Enron Energy Services Operations.  Again, thank you for bringing the email to our attention. Katherine 
 Dear Mr. Casamento,  We are in receipt of your letter dated December 6, 2000, addressed to Mr. Jeffrey Skilling regarding the above opportunity.  Your letter stated that you had also written to Mr. Mark Palmer, among others, at Enron.  Please be advised that Mr. Palmer is the appropriate person at Enron with whom to speak regarding this matter.  Thank you and happy holidays.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I think we have some flexibility on that and am checking it out.  I'll be back in touch as soon as I've resolved that.  SRS 
 Dear Suzanne,  I'm sorry for the delay in returning your e-mail.  We're catching up now after taking some time off over the holidays.  Unfortunately, due to Jeff's travel schedule, a meeting in January or even early February is not feasible.  I would be happy to schedule a meeting in late February or early March if that timing works for you.  Please call me should you wish to proceed on that basis.  Thank you and regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Shack,  Thanks for the nice note.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but I took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  immediately following the announcement.  The reunion was really great, and I'm sorry too that we missed each other. Next time you get to Houston, please give me a call (713.853.6894).  It would be great to get together and catch up.  Hope you had a great holiday and Happy New Year! -kai- Rocky 
 Wilson, Sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail - yesterday was Jeff's first day back in the since December 14, so we are catching up!  Jeff asked me to let you know that he is very supportive of this opportunity, and has conveyed that to Mr. Lay.  I'm not sure what next steps would be, but please feel free to call on us should you need our assistance further.  Regards, SRS 
 Ron,  Your e-mail was such a pleasant surprise!  Thanks so much for the kind words.  I would love to get together for lunch in the near future, though January is typically a tough month for me.  I'll have my assistant, Sherri Sera, call your office to see what we can arrange.  Thanks again for the note.  I look forward to seeing you soon.  Jeff 
 Gail,  I look forward to introducing you to the Enron management team.  Please advise when you will next be in Houston.  Jeff 
 Curly, I was copied on Ronnie Chan's note to you re: ICBC.  What are we working on with them?  Please advise.  Jeff 
 Dear Gail,  Please resend your resume in a ".doc" format.  We are unable to open the attachment below.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Wade, please send the summary to Jeff as he will be unable to participate in the call.  Thanks, SRS 
 Ranabir,  Please be advised that Jeff Skilling is traveling out of the country and will not be reachable until January 2, 2001.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Dear Hilary,  The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.  If you could e-mail or fax me this information asap it is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your assistance.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Shouldn't have responded so quickly!  Thanks for the clarification.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Mr. Brannen, Enron's Vice President of Corporate Administration would be the individual that you would speak with regarding our facility issues.  His contact information follows:  William R. Donovan (Bill) 713.853.5459  Thank you. 
 Mr. Skilling is unavailable on January 17.  However, we appreciate the invitation. Katherine Brown 
 Tamara, was Jeff Skilling copied on this e-mail in error or is there something I should be doing?  It means nothing to me, but will be happy to follow up on it  if necessary.  Thanks.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!  I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.  That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to the football game Saturday.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Rocky 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Roxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited. I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Mark, Jeff asked me to let you know that John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe, is expecting your call pursuant to the voicemail and letter you sent.  John is very anxious to talk to you.  He can be reached in London at 44.207.783.6522.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Regards, Sherri 
 Thanks for the e-mail, Nasim.  We're working on a variation of it now.  Keep up the good work.  Jeff 
 Ladies and gentlemen of Class #64,  Jeff Skilling has reserved Drayton McLane's suite at Enron Field for the October 1 (last game of the regular season) Astros game against the Milwaukee, and he would like you to be his guests.  First pitch is scheduled at 7:05p.  Please let me know if you are able to join him.  If you do plan to attend, please let me know the most convenient way to get a ticket to you.  Don't hesitate to call me should you have any questions.  I look forward to a positive response.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com  PS - if there is anyone from Class #64 that is not on this e-mail distribution, please forward a copy to them. 
 Elvis,  I cannot open this document either.  I wonder if you could fax it to Rocky at 713.646.8381.  Thank  you, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Blake, I've reserved one of our Falcon 900s for the trip, too.  It seats 12 passengers.  Please let me know departure time on 10/20, and return time on 10/23 when that has been determined.  Thanks, SRS 
 Well done!  SRS 
 Jeff Skilling will be there - thanks for the offer.  Regards, Sherri Sera 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Beek,  Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Charlene, I'm sending down the letter Benjamin sent to Jeff with some ideas about improving morale in the program, which was referenced in the e-mail I bcc'd you on a moment ago.  SRS 
 Benjamin,  Just a short note to thank you for taking the time and effort to give me some of your ideas.  Believe it or not, we're working these exact issues right now.  Thanks very much for your input.  Regards, Jeff 
 I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there.  Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Steve, thanks for the note.  It was great to meet you.  I look forward to seeing more of you in the future.  Regards, Jeff 
 Johnathan,  My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is something they would like to do.  I appreciate your assistance in this matter.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Please note changes below for Jeff and Jeffrey Skilling. 
 Charla, Jeff said this is acceptable to him.  Thanks, SRS 
 Hello, Mark.  The person you can speak to at Enron is Eric Shaw=20 (44.207.783.5408) - he heads up that part of Europe out of our London=20 office.  By copy of this e-mail, I'm letting him know to expect your call.  Glad to hear all is well.  Good luck with your project!  SRS 
 Mike, Jeff's intent is not that you would interview, but that you would put the hammer (so to speak!) on some of your people to sign up.  Have a good weekend!  SRS    Enron North America Corp. 
 Dear Ms. Kurz,  I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment.  With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the information may be sent to:  Jeffrey K. Skilling President & COO Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB5007 Houston, TX  77002  Thank you for your consideration.  We look forward to hearing from you again soon.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 e-mail: sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Thank you for the information, Mr. Haack.  For your information, Jeff does have a Federal Reserve Bank board meeting on the morning of Thursday, September 20, 2001, but we are holding the afternoon of 9/20/01 through 9/22/01 for you.  I look forward to hearing from you with more details in the coming months.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Liz, would you please e-mail me Greg's exact title.  Thanks, SRS 
 Bert, will you please e-mail me Gene's exact title.  Thanks, SRS 
 The ponytail, tattoo and the beard were gone when he showed up last Monday. I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS 
 Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe it has already come and gone!  Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it in the mail to:  Sherri Sera c/o Enron Corp. P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX 77251-1188 U.S.A.  Thanks and take care, Sherri 
 Karen, unfortunately, Jeff will be unable to review this prior to release; however, I noticed that Joe Hirko is listed as "chairman and CEO."  It is my understanding that he is "CEO" only and does not carry the "chairman" title. You might want to double-check.  Thanks, SRS 
 yes! 
 Mr. Skilling will not attend as he will be travelling. Thank you, Katherine Brown

 Dear Neil,  If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at 1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else be accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success. 
 Mr. Hobby,  Jeff Skilling and Rebecca Carter will stop by your open house Wednesday.  He does have his children early evening, so they will probably arrive after 7:30 p.m.  Please let me know if you need additional information.

 Scott, Mr. Skilling with be out of the office on Monday, November 20. Best wishes for a productive meeting with Charle Reese. Katherine Brown 
 This is correct.  SRS 
 Karen, Jeff is traveling today.  Is this the type of release that I should try to get to him before it goes out?  Please advise.  RS 
 Per our phone conversation, you may cancel this service for Jeff Skilling. Thanks, SRS 
 Mike, we appreciate you keeping Jeff in the loop for the 2001 U.S. Open. However, Jeff is not a golfer and has decided to decline this invitation. Thank you for the offer. Katherine for Jeff Skilling 
 Dear Mr. Ryan,  We are in receipt of your letter to Mr. Skilling regarding CallTech Communications contact center services.  Mr. Skilling has forwarded your correspondence to Mr. Chris Reedy, Director of Customer Satisfaction at Enron Energy Services. Upon review, Mr. Reedy will contact you if appropriate.  Sincerely, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Kevin,  Jeff's response to this inquiry is:  "No - just a social visit - he seems to be trying to make it soound like something very different."  Hope this helps - call if you need clarification.  Thanks, SRS 
 Thank you for the invitation to Mr. Skilling.  Unfortunately, he has a family commitment that will prevent his participation.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Hello, Mike.  11:30 still works for Jeff.  Why don't you meet him at the Enron Building (1400 Smith Street) - I think you had mentioned that you wanted a quick tour.  You'll have to check in at the security desk in our lobby; I'll make sure they know that you are expected so they'll give you a visitor badge and send you to the 50th floor.  I'm not sure yet where Jeff plans to take you for lunch - anything in particular you like?  SRS 
 Amelia, I was able to collect the remainder of the pledges ($5,140).  Please let me know where you are located, and I'll try to get it over there today. If you happen to be in the building and want to stop by, that's fine, too. Katherine knows where it is if I'm not at my desk.  SRS 
 Dear Neil,  Sorry you two missed each other last night.  How would 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, December 13 work for you and Paul?  I have pencilled it on Jeff's calendar at that time.  I'll hold it until I hear otherwise.  Thank you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...  Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa and getting the required shots.  Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a while?  Sherri 
 Dear John,  On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not before Jeff saw a printed copy.  Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will pursue this opportunity.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  Regards, Sherri Sera on behalf of Jeff Skilling 
 Forgot to ask you to let me know when you get the message!  SRS 
 Kristin - you're right!  I didn't realize you and your Dad had talked this morning.  Sorry for the confusion!  SRS 
 Hi again, Kristin.  Just wanted to make sure you received my e-mail yesterday about meeting your Dad at Grotto (on Westheimer) at 1:00p.  Send me a note back and let me know, ok?  Thanks, SRS 
 Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to pick you up.  Have a good time.  SRS 
 Chuck,  Thank you for the information.  I have marked the dates on Jeff's calendar, and he plans to be there.  I guess he'll get more information as the date draws closer?  Regards, Sherri 
 Mr. Paul,  Jeff asked me to see if I could find out when the Homecoming is taking place.  He'd like to be there if the dates work with his schedule.  Thank you, Sherri Sera Assistant toJeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Mr. Buttrey,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling in response to your note below.  Jeff would be delighted to join you for lunch on your visit to Houston.

 Thanks for the update, Jay.  If this guy doesn't have time to talk to you, he just not want to do business with Enron too badly!  I wouldn't waste a whole lot of time on this.  Happy Easter...SRS 
 Dear Hilda,  Jeff has asked me to forward Sophia's resume to Celeste Roberts, director of the associate and analyst program, and to Beth Tilney, who oversees recruiting for marketing and communication graduates.  They will review her resume and determine if there is a match between Enron's needs and Sophia's background and skillset.  Thank you, Hilda, for forwarding Sophia's resume.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 That's the one.  Have fun!  SRS 
 Hi, Kristin,  Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.  He would like to meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch the first time).  I'm making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00 p.m.  Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?  Thanks, Kristin, and have a nice lunch.  Sherri 
 Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of weeks ago and loved it!  Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for you...  He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out later...  You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough sketch of the safari is as follows:  7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club 7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at Ngorongoro Crater Lodge 7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge 7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey  Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on when I receive it.  I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch again early next week.  Take care, SRS 
 Metin,  Great to hear from you.  Believe it or not, my brother lives in Istanbul and my son Jeffrey and I are going to visit him this summer - somewhere in the June 23 to June 28 timeframe.  I'd love to see you if it's possible.  I'll let you know when my plans are firm.  Jeff 
 Ugh! :-) Just kidding...I figured it would be pretty early.  Count me in...SRS 
 I shall be there.  Just let me know what time you want me to show up...SRS 
 Ann, I haven't heard from you with regard to whether you want me to work the table at this program.  Please let me know...thanks, SRS 
 Dear Mr. Paul,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he will send you a check in the amount of $200.  While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is $350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so actively support research to find a cure.  I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a nice weekend.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling, President & COO Enron Corp. 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Simon, I was unable to open the attached document for Jeff Skilling.  Could= you please resend.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS 
 Mark, I sent this home to Jeff last week, and perhaps you retrieved it from his e-mail at the house.  In any event, I'm cleaning out our e-mail files and thought I'd pass it on to you.  SRS

 The actual date is Wednesday, August 8. 
 Gil,  Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.  It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.  Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

 Fernando,  I did receive your e-mails and wanted to assure you that your concerns are being dealt with.  Thank you, Jeff 
 Erica, the phone call on Tuesday, May 15, at 10:00 a.m. (CDT) between Messrs. Murdock and Skilling is confirmed.  Thank you for your patience while we worked this out on our end.  We'll await Mr. Murdock's call.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.  Thanks again for your help.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but will return tomorrow morning.  In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.  Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to free up some time.  Thank you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Erica,  Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it would be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.  Thanks, Joannie 713-345-7774 
 Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be possible to schedule during the next quarter?  Thanks, Joannie

 Shyam, Cindy Olson would be an appropriate person for you to contact within Enron.  You can reach her at 713-853-7418.  Thank you, Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774 
 Mr. Skilling will be travelling and unable to attend on May 24.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774 
 Jeff has a meeting right after the building tour, so unfortunately he won't be able to attend.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Jeff,  Unfortunately, Jeff doesn't have any information on Rick Barsky.  Would you like for me to try and get information from anyone else?  Thanks, Joannie joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 Karen, heres the version of the PRC memo you should use.  Please call if you have any questions.  SRS 
 Jay,  I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" right - just give me a call when you've got something.  Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.  Best regards, Jeff 
 Thank you for the invitation to Utilities 2001.  Due to a prior commitment, Mr. Skilling is unable to attend.  Regards, Sherri Sera 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Bill and Jeff will have their own hardhats.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Christie, please tell me you don't have Jeff down for this function.  He will be returning to Houston Monday afternoon.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby.  Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for Wednesday.  Thanks and have a great weekend.  Joannie 
 The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.  I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.  To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is:  C673EV  To begin the survey, click on the link below: http://63.211.208.100/GLOBENetwork/survey.asp  You may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.  Thank you. 
 Thank you for your e-mail.  Mr. Skilling is traveling for the remainder of this week, but will be back in the office on Monday.  Thank you, Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774 
 Jeff has agreed to participate.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Dave, please disregard my previous e-mail about the date and location in June, unless June 4-7 in Park City, UT, is not it.  As Jeff has to be in Wyoming on the evening of the 7th, it is possible that he speak in Park City that morning and then go on to Wyoming for the dinner he's attending there.  I'll be back in touch once Jeff has seen this e-mail and responded with his interest...SRS 
 Dave, do you have a date and location in June?  The month is filling up quickly, but if they can be flexible, we can probably work it out if Jeff is interested.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Thank you for the invitation.  Unfortunately, Jeff Skilling is unable to attend.  Joannie Williamson 713-345-7774

 Kevin, just wanted to let you know that a sedan through Beal's has been reserved and will pick you up at 7:15a at the Four Seasons.  I've asked that the sedan stand by and take you as directed when you are ready to leave the North Shepherd facility.  Regards, SRS 
 Thank you!  SRS 
 Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will send an e-mail with the in-room fax number tomorrow.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was cancelled.  I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from where.  The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.  I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.  Regards, SRS 
 Ok, I'll tell you what I've told everyone else - the pledges Jeff has received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 hours!  SRS 
 Thank you, Rod!  SRS 
 Thanks for the message, Tom.  I have visited the Ivory Coast, Togo and Nigeria once;  Tanzania twice; and Kenya and So. Africa three times.  I really love the place and look forward to spending lots more time there.  Thanks, too, for sharing the photos.  Jeff 
 Sam, Jeff said he would be happy to talk with you.  Just look for him in LaGrange late Saturday afternoon.  Good luck on the ride!  SRS 
 How much to you have?!  SRS 
 $50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you.  Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS 
 Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS 
 I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!  Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?  Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...  Sherri :-) 
 Stan, Jeff will be travelling the biggest portion of May.  Would you let us know the next time Ali is in the US and I will try to work something out for them to meet.  Thanks, Joannie

 Dear Mr. Morgan,  On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he must respectfully decline your invitation.  Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what I can to facilitate that for you.  Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the opportunity.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com

 I found this.  Please disregard previous note. Katherine

 Hi, Kristin.  I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch. Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow (Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.  I'll make a reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS  PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do you have it down, too?

 John, any chance you can sent this e-mail to me?  Apparently it has a "confidential" stamp on it, so even though I have access to Jeff's mailbox, it won't allow me to open it.  Unfortunately, Jeff does not check his own e-mail, and if I go into his machine, I won't be able to print it as it is not connected to any printer.  Thanks, John.  I'll see that Jeff gets it as soon as it's received.  SRS 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee. I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any questions you may have.  To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged. Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.  I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for spending your time on this critical process.  Jeff

 Mike, Jeff's intent is not that you would interview, but that you would put the hammer (so to speak!) on some of your people to sign up.  Have a good weekend!  SRS    Enron North America Corp. 
 Well done!  SRS 
 Dear Mr. Casamento,  We are in receipt of your letter dated December 6, 2000, addressed to Mr. Jeffrey Skilling regarding the above opportunity.

 Edward, Jeff is booked solid today and Friday and traveling tomorrow.  He then will be on vacation from December 18-January 2.  I would suggest that you send him an e-mail.  If he needs any additional information, we can try to get the two of you together for a few minutes the morning of the interview.  SRS 
 Jana, would you please add me to your cc: list for these calls.  Thanks.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Mr. Stuart,  Mr. Skilling has reviewed your communications and has determined that Enron is not interested in pursuing at this time.  Thank you for the opportunity.  Regards, Sherri Reinartz-Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 
 Carrie, is there protection on this report that prevents me from printing it out for Jeff Skilling?  If so, would you please remove it?  I print this for him every day and fax it to him when he's traveling.  Please let me know how I might do that.  Thanks, SRS 
 You're the best!  I owe you one.  Take care, SRS 
 Thank you, Carrie.  It printed just fine this time.  SRS   Carrie Southard @ ECT   02/07/2000 02:38 PM

 Karen, thank you for the update.  Please note in future communcations that "McKinzie" is actually spelled "McKinsey."  As Jeff worked there prior to coming to Enron, this is a typo he would notice.  I have changed it in the copy of this message given to him.  SRS 
 Happy to hear you are ok, Mark.  Do you need aything we can we can fed ex to you (or get to you in another manner if necessary?).  Please let us know.  Sherri for Jeff... 
 Rex, the format you sent the document in will not open for me.  Can you send it as a .ppt document?  Thanks, SRS 
 Hi, Suzanne.  I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate it.  And of course, anything marked "confidential" is opened only by him.  Thanks a lot, Suzanne.  Hope all is well with you.  Sherri 
 Amelia, just wanted to make sure that you had Jeff signed up...I'm sure you probably do!  SRS 
 Michael, I'm responding on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who is traveling abroad.  It appears that this is informational only for Jeff, and you are not inviting him to attend the meetings.  If this is an invitation to attend, he is unable to as he will still be traveling abroad.  Sherri 
 Mr. Collins,  Mr. Skilling is considering this invitation and has requested a bit more information.  What time are the awards presentations taking place on April 11?  Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April 12  that would be very difficult to reschedule.  Given this time constraint, I'm not sure it will work.  Please advise at your earliest convenience.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 Fax 
 Good morning, Yelba.  It has been a long time!  You may not remember me, but I have been working with Jeff since the McKinsey days (my name used to be "Baumbach").  After reviewing your e-mail, Jeff suggests that you speak to Lou Pai, Chairman & CEO of Enron Energy Services; his telephone number is 713.853.5646.  By copy of this e-mail, he is advised that you will contact him.  Good luck with your venture, Yelba, and welcome back to Houston.  If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to call me.  And please tell Richard that we said hello.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) e-mail: sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Samual, Jeff will be happy to take a photo for the Encounter.  Just let me know the details so we can make sure he's where he needs to be at the appointed time.  Good luck with the ride.  Sherri x3-5984 
 Brian, Jeff would like to know who the individual was that was communicating with the OOC.  He doesn't recall this situation - please advise.  Thanks, Sherri x3-5984 
 Rachael, well, I was wrong again.  Jeff said he is not interested in doing the morning broadcast with Sam Malone; no reason given, so I didn't ask. Sorry!  SRS 
 Dear Mr. Buttrey,  Jeff received your e-mail and asked me to respond on his behalf as he is traveling.  He would really enjoy having lunch with you on your next visit to Houston.  Please give him a call when your plans are firm...he can be reached at 713.853.6894.  Jeff also inquired as to what you are up to these days.  When you have a minute, please drop him another line.

 Mark,  I got your nice letter - hope things are going well.  I'm really looking forward to seeing you in SF next week.  Have a safe trip.  Jeff 
 Thank you for the information, Brian.  I'll make sure Jeff sees this.  For your information, should a need arise for you to give Jeff completely confidential information, his voicemail is the only secure means to do so (I do not have his password).  His extension is 3-6894.  Otherwise, all mail (e-mail included) is opened by me.  Again, thank you for your quick response for information.  SRS 
 Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 617.493.5597.  (Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse - i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).  Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to Franz.  SRS  PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his family to Houston... 
 Not a problem, Kimberly.  Thanks for the heads up.  If Franz calls before Monday, I'll transfer him to you.  SRS 
 Not necessary yet, Karen, but thanks.  Fitz is out of the office until Monday, so there won't be any action taken until then.  Thanks again, SRS 
 Brad, as I am cleaning out Jeff's e-mails, I came across this one from you. It appears to me that it has not been opened, so I'm checking to find out if you got the answer to your question.  Please let me know, and I'll try to get the information for you.  If we dropped the ball on this, I apologize.  Sherri Sera x3-5984 
 Mr. Skilling is unavailable on January 17.  However, we appreciate the invitation. Katherine Brown 
 Mark,  Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once received from the guides.  Please let us know if you're at all interested.  Thanks, Sherri 
 Mr. Brannen, Enron's Vice President of Corporate Administration would be the individual that you would speak with regarding our facility issues.  His contact information follows:  William R. Donovan (Bill) 713.853.5459  Thank you. 
 Dear Hilary,  The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.  If you could e-mail or fax me this information asap it is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your assistance.

 Ron,  Your e-mail was such a pleasant surprise!  Thanks so much for the kind words.  I would love to get together for lunch in the near future, though January is typically a tough month for me.  I'll have my assistant, Sherri Sera, call your office to see what we can arrange.  Thanks again for the note.  I look forward to seeing you soon.  Jeff 
 Wilson, Sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail - yesterday was Jeff's first day back in the since December 14, so we are catching up!  Jeff asked me to let you know that he is very supportive of this opportunity, and has conveyed that to Mr. Lay.  I'm not sure what next steps would be, but please feel free to call on us should you need our assistance further.  Regards, SRS 
 Shack,  Thanks for the nice note.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but I took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  immediately following the announcement.  The reunion was really great, and I'm sorry too that we missed each other. Next time you get to Houston, please give me a call (713.853.6894).  It would be great to get together and catch up.  Hope you had a great holiday and Happy New Year! -kai- Rocky 
 Greg, if there are two more tickets available for sale for Friday's game, I'd like to buy them.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS 
 Dear Suzanne,  I'm sorry for the delay in returning your e-mail.  We're catching up now after taking some time off over the holidays.  Unfortunately, due to Jeff's travel schedule, a meeting in January or even early February is not feasible.  I would be happy to schedule a meeting in late February or early March if that timing works for you.  Please call me should you wish to proceed on that basis.

 Stephanie, I was not able to open or view the MS150.pdf file.  Did anyone else have problems?  SRS 
 They don't have to be with the others, so this is perfect.  Thanks, Greg.  If it's easier, I can come to you...I know you guys are swamped.  SRS  PS - I didn't realize that I sent you an e-mail from Jeff's box - didn't mean to alarm you if I did! 
 Ben, I was unable to launch the .pdf file - message said "an application to open this document cannot be found."  I wasn't able to view it, too.  Can you send it in another format?  SRS 
 Hello - yes I am one in the same.  It really is a small world.  Though my schedule is pretty hectic right now with travel, etc., give me a call the next time you're in the building.  Maybe we can have a cup of coffee and catch up.  Regards,  Jeff 713.853.6894

 Dear Mr. Brannen,  Jeff has left for the day, so has not yet seen your note.  However, I wanted to let you know that the timing may not work on February 15.  He is attending a board meeting that morning, which is followed by a luncheon.  There is not much daylight in the afternoon, either, but I'll check with him first thing Monday morning to see if there is anything we can do to free up a few minutes.  Have a nice weekend.

 Patti,  It was good to see you and Mike last night.  I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will do better.  It really is a lot of fun.  Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!  Jeff  PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to you today if you are interested.  Let us know!  Hope all is well...

 Bill, many thanks for the invitation to speak at the the conference outlined below.  Believe it or not, I'm already committed to be out of the country on the dates of the conference, so I'll have to decline.  I do appreciate the offer, though.  It was nice hearing from you.  Take care, Jeff

 Dear John,  Jeff Skilling is out of the country until March 5, 2001, and will likely be able to review before his return.  Is this something that can wait?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Amelia, would you please e-mail me the Enron team sign up for for MS150? Jeff's daughter would like to ride with the Enron team.  Let me know what I owe you for that, and I'll send you a check when she fills out the registration form.  Thanks, SRS 
 Approval granted.  SRS 
 Dear Mr. Paul,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he will send you a check in the amount of $200.  While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is $350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so actively support research to find a cure.  I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a nice weekend.

 I shall be there.  Just let me know what time you want me to show up...SRS 
 Hi, Diomedes.  I just tried to reach you on your cell phone (713.539.6731) for Jeff.  Could you please give him a call at your earliest convenience? 713.853.6894 is his number.  Thanks, SRS 
 Dorothy, I have this meeting scheduled on Jeff's calendar from 1:30 - 2:30. Do you anticipate Jeff and Ken being present for the first hour of the meeting, and Ken handling the second hour?  Thanks, Joannie 
 Why don't you reserve a conference room.  That way Jeff can leave when he needs to and everyone else can continue meeting.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Dorothy, Joannie may have already responded, but Jeff is not available for dinner Monday night.  This was communicated to Dr. Ghosh last week.  SRS 
 No problem. 
 Steven, thanks for the e-mail.  Per David Cox, EBS has been in discussions with Disney for quite some time.  Thanks, Joannie 3-7774

 Ms. Robinson,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, to whom Kay Cole introduced to you via e-mail.  He would like to speak to you by phone regarding his daughter Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.  Would you be willing to provide us with your phone number?  Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your future visits to Houston.  I looking forward to hearing from you soon.

 Mr. Compton,  This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.  I will be in touch with you soon to schedule a phone call with Jeff.  Regard, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Amelia, where can I pick Jeff's rider package for the MS150?  Thanks, Joannie 
 Ugh! :-) Just kidding...I figured it would be pretty early.  Count me in...SRS 
 April 25 would be the only day that may work for Jeff.  Please advise.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Kristin will not be riding.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Stan,  Per Jeff's request, I have forwarded the resume you attached to Philippe Bibi, President & CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Jeff would be interested in a tour of the building.  Would if the afternoon of May 8, at 3:30 would work for your schedule.  At Jeff's request, I plan on including Bill Donovan.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Christie, do Sherri or I need to do anything to send the survey from Jeff's e-mail?  Thanks, Joannie 
 Can you do lunch on Thursday?  Just for fun, but to also pick your brain about roses.  Joannie 
 How about 9:00 a.m. on the 9th?  Bill Donovan will join in on the tour.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Thanks for the heads up, Micheal.  We're working to track down the source and remove it.  We really appreciate you bringing it to our attention.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 
 Thank you for your e-mail.  I have taken the liberty of forwarding your information to Cindy Olson, Executive VP of HR.  You may contact Cindy directly at 713-853-7418.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713-345-7774 713-646-8381 (fax) joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 David, just heard that you joined the 2001 Enron MS150 team - congratulations!  Look forward to seeing you out at Tully Stadium on the 20th.  Jeff 
 Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the SUN demonstration.  With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.  I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.  Thanks, SRS  http://austinventures.com/team/team.php?team_id=24  http://www.kpcb.com/team/bio_detail.php?frm_id=13  http://www.greylock.com/team/aronoff.htm 
 Metin,  Great to hear from you.  Believe it or not, my brother lives in Istanbul and my son Jeffrey and I are going to visit him this summer - somewhere in the June 23 to June 28 timeframe.  I'd love to see you if it's possible.  I'll let you know when my plans are firm.  Jeff 
 Thank you for the invitation.  Mr. Skilling will be travelling on the 19 and therefore unable to attend.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713-345-7774 713-646-8381 joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 Gentlemen,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling regarding scheduling a 20-minute conference call to discuss the above referenced presentation/panel discussion at the Houston Chapter YPO (Young Presidents Organization) meeting.  Jeff is available the afternoon of Thursday, April 12, between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. (CDT).  Please let me know what your availability is during this time period, and I'll be back in touch to nail down an exact time or to suggest an alternative date/time.  Thank you very much for your commitment to this event and for your patience in awaiting the details.  I look forward to hearing from each of you soon.

 Dear Mr. Thornton,  We are in receipt of your letter to Jeff Skilling dated March 30, 2001.  Jeff has been traveling for the past 2 weeks; however, I wanted you to know that your letter was received and that you will receive a response as soon as practical.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I may be of further assistance.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Hamd, would you take the lead on this and keep Jeff posted?  Thanks, SRS 
 Thanks for the update, Andrew.  Just let us know if what the ultimate outcome is.  SRS 
 Diomedes, I have been searching high and low for this information for you, and I think I may have found something.  I have a letter from you to Jeff dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of $110,109.00.  It broadly outlines expenses and references an attached report, which I unfortunately do not have.  Would this letter be of any help to you? Please let me know, and I'll be happy to send it right to where ever you designate.  SRS 
 Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your patience.  SRS 
 Jeff Skilling asked me to send you his new e-mail address.  It is: jeff.skilling@enron.com.  Please let us know if you need any additional information.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) jeff.skilling@enron.com 
 Greetings, Tom.  I have a great picture of you, Jeff and Jeffrey at the Inauguration that Jeff asked me to send to you.  Unfortunately, I don't have a mailing address for you.  If you would please e-mail me your address, I'll get the picture right out to you.  Thanks, and hope all is well!  SRS 
 Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of weeks ago and loved it!  Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for you...  He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out later...  You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough sketch of the safari is as follows:  7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club 7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at Ngorongoro Crater Lodge 7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge 7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey  Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on when I receive it.  I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch again early next week.  Take care, SRS 
 Gentlemen,  Messrs. Micheal Holthouse and Matt Khourie (Jeff's co-hosts of the April 24 YPO event) invite you to join them at dinner on Monday evening, April 23. Reservations have been made in Matt Khourie's name at Capital Grille, located at 5365 Westheimer Road (in the Galleria area), at 7:00 p.m.  Should you need transportation to the restaurant, I will be happy to make those arrangements for you.  Please send me a note confirming your attendance at this dinner.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Stan, Jeff will be travelling the biggest portion of May.  Would you let us know the next time Ali is in the US and I will try to work something out for them to meet.  Thanks, Joannie 
 I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!  Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?  Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...  Sherri :-) 
 Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS 
 $50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you. Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS    Enron Energy Services 
 How much to you have?!  SRS 
 Sam, Jeff said he would be happy to talk with you.  Just look for him in LaGrange late Saturday afternoon.  Good luck on the ride!  SRS 
 Thanks for the message, Tom.  I have visited the Ivory Coast, Togo and Nigeria once;  Tanzania twice; and Kenya and So. Africa three times.  I really love the place and look forward to spending lots more time there.  Thanks, too, for sharing the photos.  Jeff 
 Thank you, Rod!  SRS 
 Ok, I'll tell you what I've told everyone else - the pledges Jeff has received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 hours!  SRS 
 Hi, Kristin,  Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.  He would like to meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch the first time).  I'm making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00 p.m.  Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?  Thanks, Kristin, and have a nice lunch.  Sherri 
 Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was cancelled.  I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from where.  The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.  I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.  Regards, SRS 
 Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)? Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Thank you!  SRS 
 Kevin, just wanted to let you know that a sedan through Beal's has been reserved and will pick you up at 7:15a at the Four Seasons.  I've asked that the sedan stand by and take you as directed when you are ready to leave the North Shepherd facility.  Regards, SRS

 Dave, do you have a date and location in June?  The month is filling up quickly, but if they can be flexible, we can probably work it out if Jeff is interested.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS 
 Dave, please disregard my previous e-mail about the date and location in June, unless June 4-7 in Park City, UT, is not it.  As Jeff has to be in Wyoming on the evening of the 7th, it is possible that he speak in Park City that morning and then go on to Wyoming for the dinner he's attending there. I'll be back in touch once Jeff has seen this e-mail and responded with his interest...SRS 
 Jeff has agreed to participate.  Thanks, Joannie 
 That's the one.  Have fun!  SRS 
 The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.  I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.  To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is:  C673EV  To begin the survey, click on the link below: http://63.211.208.100/GLOBENetwork/survey.asp  You may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.  Thank you. 
 Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby. Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for Wednesday.  Thanks and have a great weekend.  Joannie 
 Christie, please tell me you don't have Jeff down for this function.  He will be returning to Houston Monday afternoon.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Bill and Jeff will have their own hardhats.  Thanks, Joannie

 Jay,  I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" right - just give me a call when you've got something.  Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.  Best regards, Jeff 
 Karen, heres the version of the PRC memo you should use.  Please call if you have any questions.  SRS 
 Jeff,  Unfortunately, Jeff doesn't have any information on Rick Barsky.  Would you like for me to try and get information from anyone else?  Thanks, Joannie joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 Dear Hilda,  Jeff has asked me to forward Sophia's resume to Celeste Roberts, director of the associate and analyst program, and to Beth Tilney, who oversees recruiting for marketing and communication graduates.  They will review her resume and determine if there is a match between Enron's needs and Sophia's background and skillset.  Thank you, Hilda, for forwarding Sophia's resume.

 Jeff Skilling is unable to attend.  Thank you, Joannie Williamson 
 Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be possible to schedule during the next quarter?  Thanks, Joannie 
 Erica,  Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it would be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.  Thanks, Joannie 713-345-7774 
 Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but will return tomorrow morning.  In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense. Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to free up some time.  Thank you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.

 Erica, the phone call on Tuesday, May 15, at 10:00 a.m. (CDT) between Messrs. Murdock and Skilling is confirmed.  Thank you for your patience while we worked this out on our end.  We'll await Mr. Murdock's call.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Gil,  Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.  It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.  Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-) 
 Thanks for the update, Jay.  If this guy doesn't have time to talk to you, he just not want to do business with Enron too badly!  I wouldn't waste a whole lot of time on this.  Happy Easter...SRS 
 Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS 
 Dear Mr. Morgan,  On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he must respectfully decline your invitation.  Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what I can to facilitate that for you.  Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the opportunity.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com

 Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to pick you up.  Have a good time.  SRS 
 Hi again, Kristin.  Just wanted to make sure you received my e-mail yesterday about meeting your Dad at Grotto (on Westheimer) at 1:00p.  Send me a note back and let me know, ok?  Thanks, SRS 
 Kristin - you're right!  I didn't realize you and your Dad had talked this morning.  Sorry for the confusion!  SRS 
 Forgot to ask you to let me know when you get the message!  SRS 
 Dear John,  On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not before Jeff saw a printed copy.  Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will pursue this opportunity.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  Regards, Sherri Sera on behalf of Jeff Skilling 
 Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...  Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa and getting the required shots.  Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a while?  Sherri 
 Amelia, I was able to collect the remainder of the pledges ($5,140).  Please let me know where you are located, and I'll try to get it over there today. If you happen to be in the building and want to stop by, that's fine, too. Katherine knows where it is if I'm not at my desk.  SRS 
 test worked!  Jeff is out of town today, so I'm responding on his behalf.  SRS 
 Hello, Mike.  11:30 still works for Jeff.  Why don't you meet him at the Enron Building (1400 Smith Street) - I think you had mentioned that you wanted a quick tour.  You'll have to check in at the security desk in our lobby; I'll make sure they know that you are expected so they'll give you a visitor badge and send you to the 50th floor.  I'm not sure yet where Jeff plans to take you for lunch - anything in particular you like?  SRS 
 Thank you for the invitation to Mr. Skilling.  Unfortunately, he has a family commitment that will prevent his participation.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Kevin,  Jeff's response to this inquiry is:  "No - just a social visit - he seems to be trying to make it soound like something very different."  Hope this helps - call if you need clarification.  Thanks, SRS 
 Dear Mr. Ryan,  We are in receipt of your letter to Mr. Skilling regarding CallTech Communications contact center services.  Mr. Skilling has forwarded your correspondence to Mr. Chris Reedy, Director of Customer Satisfaction at Enron Energy Services. Upon review, Mr. Reedy will contact you if appropriate.  Sincerely, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Mike, we appreciate you keeping Jeff in the loop for the 2001 U.S. Open. However, Jeff is not a golfer and has decided to decline this invitation. Thank you for the offer. Katherine for Jeff Skilling 
 Per our phone conversation, you may cancel this service for Jeff Skilling. Thanks, SRS 
 Karen, Jeff is traveling today.  Is this the type of release that I should try to get to him before it goes out?  Please advise.  RS 
 This is correct.  SRS 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.

 Pam, I was going through Jeff's email and found this.  See below - it looks like this went to Catherine Brown of EES (my name is with a "K").  It looks like Jeff would be available from 2:00 to 3:00.  I will put it on his calendar to attend for one hour.  Is that good for you? Katherine 
 Mr. Skilling will not attend as he will be travelling. Thank you, Katherine Brown 
 Scott, Mr. Skilling with be out of the office on Monday, November 20. Best wishes for a productive meeting with Charle Reese. Katherine Brown 
 Mr. Hobby,  Jeff Skilling and Rebecca Carter will stop by your open house Wednesday.  He does have his children early evening, so they will probably arrive after 7:30 p.m.  Please let me know if you need additional information.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 yes! 
 Karen, unfortunately, Jeff will be unable to review this prior to release; however, I noticed that Joe Hirko is listed as "chairman and CEO."  It is my understanding that he is "CEO" only and does not carry the "chairman" title. You might want to double-check.  Thanks, SRS 
 Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe it has already come and gone!  Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it in the mail to:  Sherri Sera c/o Enron Corp. P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX 77251-1188 U.S.A.  Thanks and take care, Sherri 
 The ponytail, tattoo and the beard were gone when he showed up last Monday. I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS 
 Bert, will you please e-mail me Gene's exact title.  Thanks, SRS 
 Liz, would you please e-mail me Greg's exact title.  Thanks, SRS 
 Thank you for the information, Mr. Haack.  For your information, Jeff does have a Federal Reserve Bank board meeting on the morning of Thursday, September 20, 2001, but we are holding the afternoon of 9/20/01 through 9/22/01 for you.  I look forward to hearing from you with more details in the coming months.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Dear Ms. Kurz,  I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment.  With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the information may be sent to:  Jeffrey K. Skilling President & COO Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB5007 Houston, TX  77002  Thank you for your consideration.  We look forward to hearing from you again soon.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 e-mail: sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Hello, Mark.  The person you can speak to at Enron is Eric Shaw=20 (44.207.783.5408) - he heads up that part of Europe out of our London=20 office.  By copy of this e-mail, I'm letting him know to expect your call.  Glad to hear all is well.  Good luck with your project!  SRS 
 Mr. Knapp,  Thank you for your invitation to Mr. Skilling to speak at the March 22, 2000, Energy Industry Restructuring seminar in Paris.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling's schedule does not allow him to participate.  Sincerely, Sherri Reinartz-Sera Assistant to Mr. Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Charla, Jeff said this is acceptable to him.  Thanks, SRS 
 Please note changes below for Jeff and Jeffrey Skilling. 
 Johnathan,  My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is something they would like to do.  I appreciate your assistance in this matter.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Steve, thanks for the note.  It was great to meet you.  I look forward to seeing more of you in the future.  Regards, Jeff 
 I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there.  Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Benjamin,  Just a short note to thank you for taking the time and effort to give me some of your ideas.  Believe it or not, we're working these exact issues right now.  Thanks very much for your input.  Regards, Jeff 
 Charlene, I'm sending down the letter Benjamin sent to Jeff with some ideas about improving morale in the program, which was referenced in the e-mail I bcc'd you on a moment ago.  SRS 
 Beek,  Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Jeff Skilling will be there - thanks for the offer.  Regards, Sherri Sera 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Blake, I've reserved one of our Falcon 900s for the trip, too.  It seats 12 passengers.  Please let me know departure time on 10/20, and return time on 10/23 when that has been determined.  Thanks, SRS 
 Cindy, I saw this in Jeff's email.  Is there any information we can have so that Jeff can make a contribution if he chooses to? Katherine 
 Elvis,  I cannot open this document either.  I wonder if you could fax it to Rocky at 713.646.8381.  Thank  you, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Ladies and gentlemen of Class #64,  Jeff Skilling has reserved Drayton McLane's suite at Enron Field for the October 1 (last game of the regular season) Astros game against the Milwaukee, and he would like you to be his guests.  First pitch is scheduled at 7:05p.  Please let me know if you are able to join him.  If you do plan to attend, please let me know the most convenient way to get a ticket to you.  Don't hesitate to call me should you have any questions.  I look forward to a positive response.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com  PS - if there is anyone from Class #64 that is not on this e-mail distribution, please forward a copy to them. 
 Thanks for the e-mail, Nasim.  We're working on a variation of it now.  Keep up the good work.  Jeff 
 Mark, Jeff asked me to let you know that John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe, is expecting your call pursuant to the voicemail and letter you sent.  John is very anxious to talk to you.  He can be reached in London at 44.207.783.6522.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Regards, Sherri 
 Roxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited. I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!  I never was able to open the document that was sent
