 The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  What should the consistent market convention for determining the first tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second. This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result. Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get back to you .  Thanks  Pete 
 Jeff,  since Dutch is still out could you take care of this ??  I'm not exactly sure what he is talking about.  The trades should be part of a spread in whcich reliant is also buying or selling the hub. Thanks 
 I put in an offsetting trade for the phys/financial swap.  You will have to process three confirmations to get it done 2 offsetting phys and 1 financial.  Pete 
 Was this the longest year of your life or what??  Pete 
 I am interested in the crib ,  please give me a call.  Pete 
 Thanks for the note.  Will I be able to cover the child from the time when we get leal custody? There will be a time lag possibly up to a year until the adoption will be final .  Thanks you,  Pete 
 Jeanie,  I work in the ENA gas trading dept and understand that you are our HR rep.  I would like to speak to you briefly about a benefits issue relating to the legal custody of a child.  Please call me at 3x7277 at your convenience and I will give you the details.  Thanks Pete Keavey 
 oh how the truth hurts. As a Texas resident i can tell you that Bush is by far the worse of these two evils.  Never has a more expensive suit been filled by such cheap intellect (or lack thereof).  But as usual whoever is elected will make no difference anyway. 
 Colleen,  It is AGA day could we change the time? 
 anytime after 3 pm today  i will be leaving today at 4.45 
 please call me  in the am,  i want to know again the term, and the basis quotes for the weekend put that you are asking for.  I would also like to run the methodology by you and see if you agree.  Pete 
 Good luck. 
 thanks Bill 
 any luck on getting me set up??   Pete

I will be managing these products as of 10/2/2000.  Please call id there anre any problems  Peter Keavey  713-853-7277 
 I am putting through an offsetting trade where I am selling 75,000 to you at flat.  You will recieve confirms for both trades. 
 I just  spoke to Jeff and he is interested in talking to you.  He saw your name on some kind of list for "redeployment" and asked if I knew you.   The job is in his fundamental analysis group.  He wants you to send your resume today.  Pete 
 Dale,  Here are the confirms for the Gas Daily option products that I need created.

 i don't think our rosters have a good trade match because i'm sure you are not ready to deal Davis and Robinson. Ricky was my # 1 pick for a reason and Warrick is the only decent receiver in Cin.  the two guys you are offering are not top players. 
 Rickey is always available for the right price  i would need a starting WR for him though as part of the package

 Richard,  After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of $604,000.  You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  Call me to go over the numbers if you want  Pete 
 Please create today the September  GDD/IF swap and the september Gas Daily Henry Hub swap.  Thanks

 John Arnold has a few qquestions about the updates that were/are being made to stack manager.  I could not remember from our conversation a few days ago if the changes were implemented yet. please could you give myself or John a call sometime this morning  Pete 3x7277  John 3x3230 
 Louise,  Thanks for your reply to my email.  The fixes implemented over the weekend appear to have worked extremely well.  I am sure that the changes your team made also contributed to the record  147 external and 263 total trades that I executed today.  Thanks for all your help.  Pete Keavey 
 Louise,  Those numbers are impressive without a doubt.  The success has had the unfortunate consequence of showing the limits of our current internet technology.  The delays in messages from the stacks to the website have gotten worse in recent weeks.  This is only anecdotal evidence but as a trader on the system it has been very frustrating.

 Is it possible that the Gas Daily swaps that you set up for the west are not mapped for our other gas dailly locations??  That may be the cause of some of our confusion 
 Dale,  To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short description. We would like to make in simpler.  Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type  Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the product is created ???

 US Gas  Liquidity  EOL has allowed Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial products that we trade.  The ability of all customers to execute trades and receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes and growing customer participation.  One of the benefits of this system is to allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled through third party brokers.  Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since rollout last Nov.29.   Transparency  The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  Deal Flow  As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market. 
 The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for existing products in the next few weeks. The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some work. I should have a list of new locations shortly.  Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things happen.  Thanks,  Pete

 Hi Al,  I got the email.  We didn't have any flight  plans made yet anyway.  The bachelor party sounds like it will be fun as long as us married guys can get away. I haven't been to Vegas ever so that would be fun for me.  We should stay at the Belagio if it is available for a decent price.  August is offseason in Vegas right??   Those party  days are too far behind me to remember right now.  I need a weekend away so I can get some  sleep.  If you want to feel your age just get a few kids and get no sleep for a few months.  You have the right address for me but it isn't in an Italian neighborhood we don't allow any down here.  Remember that the Baptism for Caroline  is Saturday August 4th  in NJ. We are having a dinner after at a place nearby the church I hope you both can make it.  It should be at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  Talk to you soon  Pete
