 don't know what doing for new years (mentioned n.o. to z but not sure). didn't return phone call because i was in nyc and forgot when i got home.  i don't know anything about directories talk to my brother.  i don't know what the fuck. 
 Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding. 
 I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding. The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good. We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend. After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.

 Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient. Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand. Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works. Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house.

 Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.

 Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55  Dec 00          Mar 01    This Year - Dec 00     Next Year Dec 01  Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago	 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60	0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59	2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14	 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97	9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%

 Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already). Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me know.  Love  Hubby

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island.  The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out.  When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana.  According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed.  In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation."  Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants.  Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer.  In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people."  The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo.  Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything.  Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles.  The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

 I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.  Thanks,   Martin Cuilla 
 I sent an email to the prez of Star about the furniture and cancelled our purchase from Furniture USA.  The said we should get a cedit on our credit card in 5 days.  Hopefully I will hear from him soon and we will have spankin' new furniture!

 Kayvan,  Attached is a copy of my resume.  Things are very volatile over here so I am not sure what to expect for the next three months, but if possible (and if Enron isn't banktrupt) I would like to stay here until Febuary 5.  If we are around until then, I would like to try to make a choice on a potential job by early January.  Of course if we go bankrupt everything could change.  I would like to come up sometime soon and see what options exist and how I could fit into AEP's plans.  It was good talking to you and I hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks,  Martin 
 Mike,  Please call me if you have any questions or opportunities  Thanks,  Martin Cuilla

 Doesn't make a lot of sense.  We don't have any offices in Dallas that I am aware of and his name or anything closely resembling it is not in our employee listings.

 These are last years rules so the might change a little!

 Have my options and restricted stock been set yet? 
 you know i am torn - I took OU against A&M at minus 17 but that was in OK.  Sagarin actually has the line at 5 which is a bit of a surprise and the game is in Lubbock.  Not sure if I am going to bet it or not 
 yeah i got yelled at also.  i tried to say i wasn't that drunk but z wasn't having any of that conversation.  she told me that after friday and saturday she felt i was slowly regressing.  then i told her i felt i should be able to screw missy just once.  she said that was ok.

 Trading one silver car for another - silver car with black interior 
 He said he would probably sell it around 28K which is probably $3,000-$4,000 below what you would pay new. 
 fuck them bizzzitches - i gots a passport 8500 arriving thursday.  on the serious side - if you are really interested about that car i guess we should go to sterling mccall and test drive one and check it out.  it is better to go there so you can find out what the new ones go for and if you are really getting a good deal.  let me know.

 I called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95.  After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax.  I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.  Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month. 
 i have to set it up in sportsline.com - i'll have it done before the end of the day 
 I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.  They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check for the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the Lexus from Dorland. 
 how much do you want to bet? 
 who much is the m1 field as well.  thanks for your help.

"Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years," said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. "I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."  "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.  As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.  "Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."  Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.  In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.  God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.  "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg> Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord.  As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.  "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."  Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.  "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. Cornell West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."  The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."  "God is the Original," Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."  Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.  Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.  "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."  "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat."  <http://www.theonion.com/cgi-bin/email/emailthis.cgi>    <http://adbot.theonion.com/RealMedia/ads/click_cx.cgi/www.theonion.com/topstory///26673/Bottom/default/empty.gif/63303938386330393362326133316630>  ?

 Any truth to rumor that Whitney Houston died of an overdose? 
 There is a very good website for getting information regarding current events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah  SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM Friday, September 14, 2001 WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington.  U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.  The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.  "Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."  Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.  A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the official said no determination has been made.  "We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."  Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon.  The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.  "I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

After several other uses of fuck she hung up.

 I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and mic= helle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to = it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be = bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the be= tting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept askin= g are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn'= t say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool= about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are = going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I wal= k in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we = had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts l= eaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to = email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls= .  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like an= d she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you coul= d say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs. = It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that= i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weeke= nd.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it = is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20 
 Wasssup.  I just got back from vacation so still trying to catch up.  I would love to go to lunch but I have not been allowed to go to lunch for two years.  I work on the trading floor - trading natural gas - and thanks to the lovely invention of EnronOnLine (our online trading program) we have lunch delivered in everyday and aren't allowed to leave.  It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it.  Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon.  Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour.  x35933

 do you think dale would know it was me if i bought the ass kickin for his skeeball bitch headed no self respect self?  btw - sagarin won net 4 games (if $50/game = $150 after juice) 
 he took a total of 24 games and went 14-10 and won 150 after juice

 Storey and I were talking about different places to look for coverages and insurance for death (regarding his father).  Were are some of the non standard (ie not life insurance) coverages that he should make sure he has checked.  His dad was on a business trip from Houston to NY. 
 Hey I want to check with you about pulling $750 from our checking account to deposit into my gambling account.  No I have not lost $1,000 but I am following a model and I take all the games it says and there are more than 20 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided.  I know the next question and so far I have lost $150 but I didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and I would have won $150.  Anyway, I would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise I am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend.  On a side note, the furniture people called and said the furniture is coming in in pieces and they should have it all by November which means it would ship to us between the 1st and 3 week of November but definitely before Thanksgiving. 
 yeah we are done so we can do an annuity when ever you want 
 yes that is fine 
 thanks for the heads up kevin!

 I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

 When does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid.  I thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe I am confused.  Also, since the raise was effective starting Sept. 1, will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary?  Thanks,  Martin Cuilla

 Hey we are going to Truluck's for all you can eat stone crab claws tonight in honor of my 32nd birthday.  I think it is about $35 each for the all you can eat claws or they also have steak, lobster, and seafood.  Let me know if you want to go so Zooey can make the reservation (7pm).

 don't know what doing for new years (mentioned n.o. to z but not sure). didn't return phone call because i was in nyc and forgot when i got home.  i don't know anything about directories talk to my brother.  i don't know what the fuck. 
 Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding. 
 I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding. The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good. We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend. After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.

 Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient. Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand. Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works. Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house. 
 The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the weekend.

 The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the weekend.

 Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score).

 Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55  Dec 00          Mar 01    This Year - Dec 00     Next Year Dec 01  Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago	 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60	0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59	2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14	 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97	9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%

 Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already). Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me know.  Love  Hubby
