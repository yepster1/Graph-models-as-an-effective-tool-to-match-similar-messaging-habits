 Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25. They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today.

 Great Expectations Forbes - 10/16/2000 BY Lynn Cook Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.  ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail.  The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover.  Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet connections to its iPAQ Pocket. 
 Of course...Tuesday it is! 
 How are you?  I was just thinking of you guys and wanted to say "hi"!!! 
 Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!! Yes, let's allget together soon...call me!  Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one? 
 Count me in.

 Vacation week of July 31- August 4.  Jury Duty on August 14.  Thanks. 
 Sure, let's talk. 
 Hi Mike,  Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!  How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much shorter!  Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?! 
 Good. 
 Count me in, if still available.  Thanks! 
 Would love to attend, but I will be out on vacation.  Can I have a copy of any notes that are taken? 
 Miss you guys too!  Thanks for asking about Meghan....she's going to be 2 next month (where has all the time gone?)!  It sounds like you're having a terrific time too.  Been to Disney again?  Let's talk soon and thing about me when you guys go to Zios!!! 
 Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan and I are going to be on vacation in California.  Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs! 
 What do you think?  If we forward this, I think this needs to be cleaned up. 
 Got them.  They're beautiful...thanks! 
 Please approve. 
 I was out the afternoon of Tuesday, November 28.  Thanks. 
 How about somewhere in between?  Where's Danetta?  Maybe Treebeards in Interfirst Plaza? 
 Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out otherwise, let me know!  Thanks.     Ginger McCain                06/30/2000 09:56 AM

 Revenue Generating: Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at max tariff rate for California deliveries; generating $2.7 million in revenue.  Included was a sharing mechanism providing an opportunity to generate market based transport. Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 35,000/day of supply on east end of system. Executed pooling agreement with Cima Energy to become a new customer on Transwestern, providing 5-10,000/day of incremental supply on TW's system.  Non-Revenue: Settled dispute with Burlington that could have cost $3 million dollars; negotiated potential damages down to $100,000 and eliminating future potential dollar exposure. Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices. Located over $600,000 on Northern. Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system.

 Notwithstanding anything herein that may be interpreted to the contrary, the aggregate Operational Imbalance for all Interconnect Points in any month will be within a 10% tolerance level (i.e., neither exceeds 110% of the quantities scheduled, or is less than 90% of the quantities scheduled).   Bill, Here is how I currently have paragraph 6 (tolerance level) in the OBA.  Should we insert another sentence reemphasizing that "all imbalances" will be "cashed out"?   Michelle Lokay Account Director Transwestern Commercial Group 713-345-7932 
 Weather Trading Energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two. The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter. If, therefore, you have an unusually cool summer, the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated, and the same in case of an unusually warm winter. Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand, and would face serious financial losses in such cases. Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations. It is no surprise, then, that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher, head of weather trading for Mirant <http://www.mirant.com/>. In describing weather trading, Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997. Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product. He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor. With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica, I-Wex, Spectron, Aquila, LIFFE, Mirant, Bewag, Aon and Entergy-Koch, Weather Trading Europe <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/> provided three days of the latest developments in European trading. The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it; data issues-the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills. As weather trading takes its place in the online world, there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry.

  Subject: NWP System Notice - System Operations   Post Date: March 15, 2002 Category: CRITICAL NOTES Subcategory: MISCELLANEOUS Subject: System Operations  Notice Text: All Shippers Letter #02-033 Date:	3/15/02 Time:	11:00 a.m. MST  Subject: System Operations  The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest's shippers of how it intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities.  Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests on April 16 and 17, 2002.  During this time Northwest will have no access to Clay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5, 2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.  During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressor have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in, Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwest will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.  If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate; and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.  If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule by securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson Prairie storage during this work.  Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the situation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.  If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services representative. 
 More information.  The Questar (Southern Trails) tie-in is for one day only, 04/02.  The Ignacio to Blanco line, from La Plata, will be down over 700 million (which is pretty much the whole lateral) from 04/02-04/05.  Talk soon, Michelle.

 Approved.  Please increase, on Amendment #4, the West Texas receipts from 14,265 to 18,000 effective Nov 2002-Feb 2003.  This will still leave a balance of 2,000 at the "East of Thoreau" area.  The Red Rock administration contract will also need to be adjusted.  Thanks.

 Yes, I will keep you posted.  They have another level of approval left.  If that happens, we will receive either check or wire. 
 Approved.  Amendment to increase TQ by 10,000 for 2 days. 
 This is the San Juan to San Juan contract, with alternates out of the path.  Same as December. 
 FYI.  Section 13(h) does state 3 months prior to expiration and 07/31/02 is 3 months before 10/31/02.

 Happy Holidays!      Dear Tech Support,  Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.  Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do?  Desperate  > >---------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear Desperate,  First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.  Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.  DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.  In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.  Good luck.

 FYI...this is the conference call that I'd mentioned during staff meeting yesterday. 
 What do you think of this itinerary?  You guys would leave San Antonio and pick us up at Hobby for the same flight to Orlando.  On the return trip, we leave 1 1/2 hours before you, but you guys have a direct flight.  The trip is Friday through Saturday, for 8 nights.  The flights are getting more limited and have increased again!

 This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the "View Printable Page," that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

 Wow...is that what really happened?!?!  I am so glad it's all clarified.  Since we're suing everyone (the accountants, the lawyers, etc.), we might as well sue our long distance carrier.  Talk soon!

 Hi Teresa, Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for my directory information.

 Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.
