 Jeff, Tim told me to put together a list of inormation we would want from the ISO. As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the highlights:  1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the following paths: a. path 15 b. path 26 c. nw1 d. nw3 e. az2 f. az3 g. lc1  2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)  3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment bid out of the stack  4. Intrazonal Cong a. What paths have intra-zonal cong b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis  5. BEEP stack  6. All load and generation bids DA by SC  7. Real time production from each plant

We would like to make this change because we think the elimination of physical risk will benefit us commercially. Thus for bona fide commercial reasons, we will go financial with 50% of our open Block Forward position.  Bob Badeer  Manager West Power Trading Enron North America
