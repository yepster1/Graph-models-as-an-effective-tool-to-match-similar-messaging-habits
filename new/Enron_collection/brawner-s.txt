 Please sign me up for a space in the new garage. 
 i am confused---i thought you guys are coming over friday evening for dinner 
 Well Ray as you might as well have guessed your timing does suck.  All this time has gone by and the day Enron does a "deal" with Natsource, you decide we should have a drink and share a meal.  You guys will never cease to amaze me. 
 THOUGHT YOU WOULD APPRECIATE MY SITUATION HERE.   NOW YOU TELL ME - HE IS NOT MY FRIEND HE IS BROKERING ME FOR MY BUSINESS.  HE DID THIS NOW BECAUSE OF THE ENRON NATSOUCE DEAL.  RIGHT?   PLEASE BE HONEST - I TRUST YOU 
 thanks - that was funny 
 And --FYI I  Dont do pictures!!!! ever   - 
 Need you?  Why would we!    Smiling 
 Hey - I just checked my E MAils for the day.  Sorry to hear about the interview with AEP.  I really am quite surprised.   Did Kayvon say why they didnt want to give you an interview?   I believe your thinking correctly , you need to seriously consider the Balitmore job.  And dont forget there is that possiblilty with AGL in Houston.  Correct? 
 i would love to !!! thnks

 I can go Monday but I can't Tuesday.  How are you Pam ?  Can you / will you forward to Susan. 
 I appreciate your note and yes it has been awhile since we spoke.  I do chat with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will forget. nor understand.   Sincerely,  Sandra 
 Hello Matt-   I am not verifying these transactions via EMail - for no other reason than time.  We should send you a confirmation by now.   If you need to confirm these please call Jeff  Royde @ 35295.   thanks

 I AM LOL - GAS OR TERDS  0 OKAY OKAY - I AM SORRY - I DIDNT KNOW THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER TRADING PHYSICAL THEN YES I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL SCOTT

 Jeff,  Just a quick note to say "thank you" for your comments at year end.  I sincerely appreciated your comments and support. I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.

 You put a smile on my face with your message.... The reading material is no big deal - It is some Gas Rags story about Skillings comments. And your customer is completly happy with her trim - However , She (me) wants to be a regular client. 
 Hello Kenny,  Just a couple of things.  One our stock is up again today  now it is up 2 at 62$  I was wondering if we should sell some?  What is your opinion. Also I have some reading for you tonight - The Skiliing Story is all over the Gas Market.  (I told Ya).  I know that Clayton has soccer tonight - dont worry about dinner , I would actually prefer some of that Turkey tonight.  I love you 
 Thank you for your comments. 
 Tami,  Thank you so much for your invitation.  I think it is a wonderful idea.  I, however, will be unable to attend.  Thank you againn and I am sure that you will have a wonderful time.

 Thank you for the message - i need it today .  It is 2:35 and i am exhausted - i need a cig and a beer.  I love you.   Sandra 
 ?? I do not understand what this message is for and why i am receiving  it. 
 I have no idea what this means. Please explain. 
 Of course - come by and collect - I dont have my checkbook but you can put me down for a $25.00 donation 
 We  can go out of town - i would love to get away - have you heard about the hilton in Austin?    Call me today when you get a minute 
 Susan, We had the best time.  Good friends, great experiences, weather , etc.  Now we all want to move to  Denver.  I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so well. I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased it.  So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?  I am soooo jealous.  I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense. Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced?  Do you already have the plans made? Call me or write me back.   Hey - I am getting more and more excited about NYC. 
 Hello.  I dont understnd your response?  Are you talking about the retreat? 
 sounds great - but i am too conservative.  That is alot of $$ for three days.  And it is close to x-mas.   Sorry - maybe later in the year? I had a nice time at Bens party.  Thank you for being you. 
 i dont get it 
 Steve - will you call me, when you get a moment> 
 Steve,  My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that Matt and Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I do not believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to do business with Natsourse today or in the future. 
 I have received your E-Mail .  Steve,  I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.  You need to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas Dailys.   Thank You 
 I have received your e-mail.  Thank you for your thoughts. 
 I have received your E-Mail. 
 Great!  I am glad that your trip is postponed - then we will be able to get together.  Call me or write when you get thoses details. Looking forward to your visit.   Sandra 
 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you .  My mom had some surgery last week and I was in and out of the office.  Thursday the 21st is not good for me. Kenny is going hunting (birds)  and I will need to be available for the children.  Let me know if there is another evening that will work> 
 How are you today ?   Must be busy, I havn't heard form you much.   I am bored. 
 Hello Bill,  It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference there.  Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though. Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these days.  Lunch is out of the question.  So we are looking at drinks or dinner. the week of the 20th is better.  The week of the 25th is not going to be easy cuz it is settlement week.  Pam is doing fine.  Still looking for a job.  Hopefully something will happen soon.  She had mentioned that you wrote a note,  I guess I got the impression she had replied.  She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in her life so just give her some time. 
 All is fine with one exception.  Do not set up a product for the columbia mainline     Thanks 
 You know i will do anythint i can to help. 
 spoke with Jeff this morning he doean't know these guys .  sorry - good luck 
 WOW that was very powerful.  thank you for sharing this with me.    it makes me want to make a few changes to my life,  thank you have a great weekend maybe we can go to dinner late nexr week 
 you are most welcome.  take care of yourself and your babies. 
 thanks 
 Wanted to say Hello.  I must tell you I miss you, I don't have anyone to shake my head at anymore. Hoping all is well with the new position.  Also wanted to thank you for calling Pam I do appreciate that .  There are  plans are for my husband and I to meet some friends of yours this weekend.  We are getting together with the Schnitzers and they have invited the Kushnicks . Jon and Susan really enjoy them and have wanted to introduce us for some time now. Looking forward to the introduction.    Again,  I hope the job is treating you well.   Best Regards, Sandra

 Jeff, I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.  In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.  And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!! 
 I am sorry Ladies - But I cant see you guys this week. 
 Hello Kenny,  Just a note to say Hello and that I love you .  I enjoyed yesterday afternoon.  And I also wanted to thank you for getting up early this morning and fixing my coffee and my slim fast.  That meant alot to me, more than you know.  Enjoy your day - I will see you after my hair appointment tonight.   Love and Kisses Sandra 
 April 8, 2001, 10:45PM  Learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-April deadline  By GARY KLOTT Tribune Media  For the many millions of individuals who have yet to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no reason to panic.  If you need more time to file your return, you can easily get a filing extension.  And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be subject to interest and penalties for payments made after April 16, you can put off the day of reckoning for months without fear that IRS collection agents will come after you. There is even a loophole in the law that will enable many individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being assessed interest or penalties.  Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need to file either your tax return or an extension request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes owed by April 16.  April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001.  Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact, the IRS has expanded the options this year for obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by phone, computer or mail.  The traditional way to get an extension is to fill out IRS Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16 deadline. If you're using tax-preparation software or a tax professional, you can file your extension request by computer. Or you can phone in your extension request by calling 888-796-1074.  If you owe the IRS money, another option for requesting an extension is to make the payment by credit card (American Express, Discover or MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one of the two companies the IRS has authorized for processing credit card payments. Details on the option are included in the Form 4868 instructions.  By making the extension request, the IRS will automatically give you four more months, until Aug. 15, to file your return.  You can get an extension for any reason. No explanation is asked for when requesting an extension.  But be aware that your extension request only gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty charges, you must estimate how much you owe and make the payment with your extension request by the April 16 deadline.  Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax bill, you should at least file an extension request by the April 16 deadline.  Though you'll be subject to interest and possible penalty charges for late payment of your taxes, you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a maximum 25 percent.)  Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay your balance due in monthly installments. You make the request for an installment agreement when you file your completed tax return using Form 9465, "Installment Agreement Request."  "Offer in compromise": If you can't afford to pay all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a period of years, you may be able to work out a settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded its "Offer in Compromise" program, in which taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using IRS Form 656, "Offer in Compromise."  A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all you need is an extra month or so to come up with the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you may be able to get a short reprieve without being subject to interest or penalties.  All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to calculate your tax bill for you.  If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be assessed any penalties or interest.  To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable income must be less than $100,000 and you can't itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained in IRS Publication 967, "The IRS Will Figure Your Tax."  Retirement account contributions: If you hope to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension.  The deadline is more flexible for self-employed retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be made up until the due date of your return, which can be later than April 16 with a filing extension.  Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers and other individuals who need to make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 16 also is the deadline for making the first installment for 2001. 
 Too Funny! 
 No problem really-  Glad I could help

 I have no idea what this e-mail is suppose to mean to me? 
 Louise,  Sempra Energy has called and asked to "cover' outstanding positions with Enron. They have done some deals with me this morning via EOL, as well as a "sleeve" with EPNG in order to minimize their exposure with us.  Indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well,  I advised them to call the respected traders first, as apposed to calling voice brokers,  to see what they can facilitate. 
 Scott,  Just a quick note.  I believe you did a great job this afternoon in communicating with your group about Enron's "cluster." Today I have found this overwhelming since of Pride for this company and I don't want it to fail.  So if there is ANYTHING I can do to help please let me know.  I am in for the challenge and the long haul.   Sincerely, Sandra 
 I believe 1. 
  I had mentioned to you last night that I would forward you the memo I sent my CEO of Enron yesterday. Today seems better here, not so much anger around the trade floor.    This is our BID Week so we have alot of business to take care of.  And as of  9:11 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 1st time in weeks.  Hopefully,  we can close ont he Highs. 
 As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not begin to explain the pit in my stomach.  I have been an employee of Enron since June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions and or ask direct questions. I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catastrophe are still employed.  And I guess I need to understand why?  FIRED THEM !   It is apparent to me  that the information we have given to the market place is not sufficient enough.  "THEY" don't trust us anymore.  Get a plan of action, attack it, and save this company. 
 Where do I begin?  I guess I could start with several excuses or reasons to justify my behavior on Friday, but the truth is there aren't any.  I only am left with total humiliation and embarrassment for my actions, words, and behavior.  Please accept my sincere apology.  Sandra 
  I thought you would like this 
 sure no problem - but I dont have any idea as to who I am interviewing or where I am suppose to go.  WIll this information follow later? 
 Colleen, I think you will find this very interesting. 
 When are you going to call Kenny and have him help you walk through getting Instant messanger  - you will love it _ I promise 
 Why are you so cranky?  Anything I can do?   Hey I spoke to my friend (mike) and told him about you and Jon - you know all the good stuff, how nice you guys are, what good friends we have become, that you all live in Greatwood (like they do), that you guys have a 2 year old son (like they do), that your families are all up North (like thiers are)  and he want the six of us to have dinner so he and his wife can get to know you and JOn ...Interested? 
 Hi pick up it is me on the phone 
  Now this is postive thoughts.   This is thinking the glass is half full.  I wish I were more like this.  Life would be so refreshing if we all stopped whinning and looked at life this away....  I miss you, call me 
 Yes Susan sounds good to me.  let me know - and I would advise you to double check with Brennans to make sure they do still shuttle. 
 Thanks, this gave me a nice chuckle this morning.   I wish I had the nerve to send it to John Mckay , but i dont. 
 Thanks you so much - for the information - i will be sure to share it with him.. He didnt come to work this week, he called in Tuesday abd resigned.........I have tried to reach him by cell but he  hasnt returned my call.   And NO!  Uncle Harry is not calling, writing, or more importantly using the POSTAL SERVICE!

 Good Morning Susan,  Just a couple of things....I had a ball at Tammi's party Saturday.   (you did also?) And, IF you have any cloths from Ben start saving them for me...my brother and his wife are adopting Eddie and Alex,  a story there i will share later.   Have a nice day! 
 I dont know how to reply - that is weird, scary, and sad. 
 I thought I would share with you some of the E-Mails I get from my firends in the business that I am in - we ladies tend to share theses with each other - because we work in a mans world. 
 Brad,  I really don't know where to begin other than just to say it.  Enron is having some extremely difficult times now.  I have been trying to focus on helping Enron stay together.  This is not a good time for you or anyone else to try and seek employment here.  I am sorry if I am letting you down.  I was only wanting to help.  I will always keep you in mind, and hopefully when things turn around here I will be able to address you coming here. 
  Here is some "light" reading for you.  Print this one out, get a coke, and = a pack of cigs.   Enjoy!  The author got this one right,  this has been my = life and many many others for a long time --- this is what enrons culture h= as been like for years. 
 Laughing!  thanks for relaying the message to your brother, I had told him I sent him an Email and he just insisted he didnt get one, now I guess we all know why ...  I am glad your enjoying school so much, I look forward to seeing you for the Holidays also.  Any Christmas suggestions this year?   Take care- and I owe you and your brother some "hamburger money"  I will take care of you guys at Thanksgiving.   Take Care  Sandra 
 I thought you may appreciate this. 
 yes i have read that one.  Rotten tomatoes appear to be all around enron. 
 jim schwieger sent it to me i thought you would enjoy his commetns 
 Tom,  I sat and read your letter and again my heart stopped beating.  My life too has changed forever.  I too will never be able to work HARD for a company believing that my best interest are being considered.  Lets all hope, pray, and believe that one day, some day we are better, stronger people for having learned such hard lessons.  I applaud you for your honesty.  Sincere Regards, Sandra 
  My friend Pam who is in my business and my circle of friends.  ENjoy this Colleen. 
 thanks - Dont be so nervous with me - I am not as bad as "they" make me out to be - smiling

  Enjoy 
  Enjoy

 Please advise me if you received my package.  The service that was used was interesting and didn't give me a comfortable feeling.  Thank You Sandra Brawner 
 John,  I need to get with you sometimes soon to make those changes to my contract (2001 bonus).  I was in somewhat of a rush yesterday evening and neglected to make the changes you had advised me about.  I have already forwarded the information back to Enron.  Thanks 
 Again - You will find in my EOL "today's transactions"  a buy for 2 a/day dec nymex swap at a price of 2.805.  These swaps were in error - John Arnold had advised me that these swaps were to be cancelled.  Thanks Sandra 
 David,  Per a conversation with John Lavorado he mentioned that an amended agreement was coming for my signature.  I was curious as to when I should be expecting the amended agreement, could you confirm please. 
 Yes, I signed and returned the original one last week.  Your assistant verified that Enron had received it.  It is the revised one I am curious as to the status. 
 Tami,  Thank you so much for your invitation.  I think it is a wonderful idea.  I, however, will be unable to attend.  Thank you againn and I am sure that you will have a wonderful time. 
 She is precious...... I need a baby fix.................. 
 Well Now - how interesting - - They were cute.

 Who is Joey? 
 Just wanted to congradulate you and wish you much success in your new endeavors.   Warmest regards, Sandra 
 Just a quick note to welcome you and congradulate  you on your new endeavors.    Warmest Regards, Sandra 
 I can go Monday but I can't Tuesday.  How are you Pam ?  Can you / will you forward to Susan. 
 I appreciate your note and yes it has been awhile since we spoke.  I do chat with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will forget. nor understand.   Sincerely,  Sandra 
 Hello Matt-   I am not verifying these transactions via EMail - for no other reason than time.  We should send you a confirmation by now.   If you need to confirm these please call Jeff  Royde @ 35295.   thanks

 Smiling - thnks that is so true.  We missed you last night 
 Smiling.  At  your comments about Samantha - yes she did - and yes she is amazing.  Our Holidays were wonderful.  Our New Years was no big deal at all.  We (Kenny and I)  were a little under the weather and therefore did nothing - I  went to bed at 12:01   .   anyway - love to get togther for dinner soon.  have aq nice week.   Think warm thoughts Susan- Sandra 
 thanks you for this - i love it 
 I would love to but i can't this week.  Maybe next week.  But you guys please go on without me. 
 Hello Susan - Happy New Year - I hope all is well with you and yours. The best of luck getting organized.  The Brawner's 15911 Marwick Ct Houston, Tx 77095  home   281-855-8797 sandra cell  713-594-7369 kenny cell    281-381-7288 
 scott phone numbers are 853-4723   and i guess his email is scott neal @ enron .com?  - good luck - love ya 
 I AM LOL - GAS OR TERDS  0 OKAY OKAY - I AM SORRY - I DIDNT KNOW THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER TRADING PHYSICAL THEN YES I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL SCOTT 
 i think part of the problem is only physical jobs are available at enron running your own book is something they just dont hire outside the office very often. of course this is the gas side only 
 hi just got to my emails - i will call yo on my way home tonight 
 Jeff,  Just a quick note to say "thank you" for your comments at year end.  I sincerely appreciated your comments and support. I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.  Say when am I going to see that new home of yours?  You know it is hard to continue to live vicariously through you if I don't know what to picture!   Sandra 
 Thanks - I love you 
 A Merry Christmas wish to you and yours.  I still miss you much Bill.  Have a safe and warm Holiday. 
 Thanks Tami - I wish I could make it.  You gals have fun .  Send my regrets to everyone. 
 Thank you for the message - i need it today .  It is 2:35 and i am exhausted - i need a cig and a beer.  I love you.   Sandra 
 ?? I do not understand what this message is for and why i am receiving  it. 
 I have no idea what this means. Please explain. 
 Of course - come by and collect - I dont have my checkbook but you can put me down for a $25.00 donation 
 We  can go out of town - i would love to get away - have you heard about the hilton in Austin?    Call me today when you get a minute 
 Susan, We had the best time.  Good friends, great experiences, weather , etc.  Now we all want to move to  Denver.  I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so well. I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased it.  So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?  I am soooo jealous.  I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense. Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced?  Do you already have the plans made? Call me or write me back.   Hey - I am getting more and more excited about NYC. 
 Sorry I missed the meeting . I just now am reading my E-Mail messages form yesterday and today. 
 Hello.  I dont understnd your response?  Are you talking about the retreat? 
 sounds great - but i am too conservative.  That is alot of $$ for three days.  And it is close to x-mas.   Sorry - maybe later in the year? I had a nice time at Bens party.  Thank you for being you. 
 i dont get it 
 Steve - will you call me, when you get a moment> 
 Steve,  My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that Matt and Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I do not believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to do business with Natsourse today or in the future. 
 I have received your E-Mail .  Steve,  I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.  You need to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas Dailys.   Thank You 
 I have received your e-mail.  Thank you for your thoughts. 
 I have received your E-Mail. 
 Great!  I am glad that your trip is postponed - then we will be able to get together.  Call me or write when you get thoses details. Looking forward to your visit.   Sandra 
 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you .  My mom had some surgery last week and I was in and out of the office.  Thursday the 21st is not good for me. Kenny is going hunting (birds)  and I will need to be available for the children.  Let me know if there is another evening that will work> 
 How are you today ?   Must be busy, I havn't heard form you much.   I am bored. 
 Hello Bill,  It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference there.  Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though. Things are kinda hectic
