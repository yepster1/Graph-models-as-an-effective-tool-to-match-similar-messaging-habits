 Boy, I'm REALLY mad at you!  Just kidding!  I thought you were just going to initial the signature pages and then we would get Kevin to sign it here.  Since you're in town, I can run the originals down to you (if you'll tell me where you are) so that you can initial and then I can ask Kevin to sign.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Here are my exceptions:  8/17 - vacation 8/20 - sick 8/31 - vacation  Thanks! 
  Veronica:  Here's the Coastal States Trading, Inc.'s ISDA.  Marie 
 Carol:  Attached are the ENA/Enron Corp. certificates.  I was just going to work off these forms when (or if) EBS ever executed an ISDA. 
 Do we know a counterparty name or do I have to look at all our files? 
 I can't help this time.  The only Enron Corp. guaranty we have was issued in connection with financial transactions only.  Sorry. 
 Kim:  Attached are the forms I mentioned.  Let me know if they have any questions.  Marie 
 Roeline:  Here is the tax i.d. number for ENA Upstream Company LLC:  76-0318139.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Marie 
 Attached is Annex B to be attached to the confirms for Deal Nos. Y49003.1 and Y49036.1.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I believe all deals going forward.  Am I right, Max? 
 Martha:  Thanks for getting the changes to the form of guaranty approved.  Will you please have the guaranty dated effective as of January 1, 2001?  Also, who will be the party signing the guaranty, and when can we expect to receive the signed guaranty?  In addition, when  the guaranty has been signed on your part, will you please fax a copy to me at (713) 646-3490?  Again, thank you for your assistance on this.

  Tracy:  Can you prepare this guaranty for Pat Leahy?  The EBS entity will be Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd.  As you can see from the e-mails below, they need this guaranty today.  Thanks!  Marie 
  FYI 
 Hi, Veronica!  I'm trying to clean some files off my desk and one of them is Bayer.  Are you still going to revise the credit?  Thanks!  Marie 
 We have received an executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of September 21, 2001 by and between Virginia Power Energy Marketing, Inc. and Enron North America Corp.  This first amendment increases the collateral thresholds for both Party A and Party B.  Copies will be distributed. 
 No exceptions.  Thanks 
 I think I received this e-mail in error.  I am in the Legal-financial trading group.  Marie 
 Diane:  We just sent drafts to Torch as they needed to send them to UOM, Dynegy and Sempra for review.  When we get them signed, I'll distribute copies.  Marie 
 Mark:  I would like to schedule this Friday, 10/5 as a vacation day.  Please let me know if this presents a problem.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Georgi:  We have an entry in our database that states that Energy West Incorporated did not change its name to Mercator Energy Incorporated.  There are two companies with the same name and this one is not the one that changed its name.  Our Energy West Incorporated is a Montana corporation.  The one that changed its name is a Colorado corporation.  Let me know if this is confusing.  Marie 
 Hi, Diane:  In your spare time (HA! HA!) will you check and let me know the earliest outstanding trade dates for the following counterparties:  Catequil Overseas Partners, Ltd. Catequil Partners, L.P.  They are ready to sign the ISDAs.  Thanks!  Marie 
 You barely escaped our wrath this time, but there's always the next! 
 Hi, Todd:  Believe it or not, I am working on our comments to the ISDA and hope to have them to you this week.  If I see we won't get them to you this week, I'll let you know.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Brian:  The ISDA is being faxed to you now.  Marie 
 Cindy:  Attached are forms of Enron Corp. guaranties and related certificates to be issued in connection with ISDA Master Agreements between ENA and Catequil Partners, L.P. and ENA and Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd.  Please let me know when the attached documents are ready and I'll arrange for pick up.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Correct.  I just left you a voice mail re the termination. 
 Do you want me to take a first stab at these two agreements? 
 Attached is a copy of the transmittal letter forwarding the draft ISDA Master Agreement to Southern States.  Marie 
  Rotation, please. 
 Mr. Guinn:  Pursuant to Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching for your review a proposed Second Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement amending the existing amendment to change the Part 4 section references.  Please advise if the attached document is acceptable, and I will have two copies signed and forward to you for execution by Bank of America.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Diane, Tanya and Jay:  We have been requested in connection with an SEC subpoena to produce documents related to the referenced counterparties (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have checked our Lotus Notes database and don't have a record for either of these entities.  Will you let me know if your groups have had any dealings with these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of these entities?  We MUST respond to Enron Corp. Legal by noon Thursday (10/4).  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Russell:  Attached for review is the draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the Torch deals.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks!  Marie 
 We've had the lynch mob organized for some time now.  We're just trying to use the "kinder and gentler" approach for now.  But, if that doesn't work, look out! 
 Do you want to send it to Roeline or do you want me to? 
 Thanks, Diane! 
 Okay with me! 
 Hi, Roeline!  Attached for your review is a draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the assignments and terminations.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Our Confirmation Desk is in the process of revising the termination of ENA Deal No. NL0619.1 to delete the fee reference, and I will forward it to you when ready.  Please let me know when you have signoff on the other documents and I will finalize and have executed by ENA and forward to you.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Gordon:  Attached is the Deemed ISDA and fax cover page for Deal No. Y61166.1 between ENA and the referenced counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 FYI 
  Linda:  Will you follow-up with Tanya in Credit as to exactly what type of documents you need copies of, or arrange for someone to go and look through her files?  Tanya's phone # is 33263.  Thanks!  Marie 
 She was going to revise the termination and bring it to me, but I haven't gotten it yet.  Marie 
  FYI 
 Where were you yesterday?  You didn't stop by to initial Allegheny.  Are you going to initial this before you go to London? 
 Tom:  You can only see the master agreement database.  The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.  The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.  It should be in the brokerage agreement database.  We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.  Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke,  Marie 
 You should have received a fax from me by now.  Have you not received it? 
 Yes. 
 Hi, Roeline!  I'm sending the original revised Termination Agreement over to you this afternoon.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Yea, and it needs to stop right now! 
 Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.  We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.  Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?  (Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.)  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Roeline:  We would prefer to sign the fee letter at the same time we sign the assignments.  Yes, we will sign enough originals of all documents so that all parties can have an original.  Hopefully we can get this wrapped up tomorrow, as I will be out of the office Friday.  Marie 
 Barbara and Anne:  Below is an e-mail I sent to schedule a meeting with the confirm desks to discuss the materials we will need in order to start the review of the confirm templates.  Do you want to attend?  If so, I will notify you once I hear from everyone else as to their availability so that we can schedule a meeting that we all can attend.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Okay.  Why don't you let me know on Monday your availability for next week.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Dianne:  Thanks for responding so quickly.  It seems that we will be scheduling the meeting for next week.  Are you available then?  Marie 
 Joe:   Attached are the Deemed ISDAs for the two deals that were done yesterday with the referenced counterparties.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Attached is the Annex B for the referenced counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 This is an easy one.  1400 Smith, EB3803B.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Diane:  I hate to bother you since you're busy, but will you sign one more original of each of the two Torch termination agreements for me?  Torch wants a copy with original signatures for their file, so in order for us to have an original with their signature, we need to have two originals signed.  When they're ready, if you'll call me, I'll send a clerk down to get them.  Thanks!  Marie 
 What about next week?  Diane asked if we could schedule for next week as she is swamped and short-handed this week.  Marie 
 You're the best!  Thanks! 
  FYI.  We received this worksheet from Aparna for a trade with Interstate Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries? 
 Roeline:  Do you have a fax/phone number for Eric Twombly?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Mr. Smith:  Pursuant to Wendi LeBrocq's request, I am attaching a draft Confidentiality Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Sunlaw Energy Corporation.

 Sara:  I do not see a copy of an opinion in the file nor have we received one since I sent the execution copies of the ISDA to Steve Lins.  Marie 
 Yes.  I do have a meeting at 10 this morning, but should be out around 11.  Just let me know. 
 We have received an executed financial Master Agreement.  Type of Contract:	Master Agreement (Industrial)  Effective Date:		August 2, 2001  Enron Entity:		Enron Canada Corp.  Counterparty:		Albchem Industries Ltd.  Transactions Covered:	Approved for natural gas and crude oil products.  Not approved for pulp and paper, weather, foreign 				exchange, steel, interest rate and currency or forward rate.  Confirming Entity:	Enron Canada Corp.  Governing Law:		Province of Alberta 
 I did the comparison and gave it to Mary to review.  Credit is deciding what to do in light of the problems with the airlines. 
 Matt:  Attached for your further handling is the form of guaranty to be issued by Commercial Metals Co. in favor of ENA, guaranteeing obligations of SMI.  Please note that Commercial Metals needs to complete SMI's correct legal name.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie x33907 
 This has sound to it. 
 We would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, October 10 from 2:00 to 3:00 in EB38C2 to discuss the materials Legal will need in connection with its review and approval of all confirmation templates currently being used.  Please let me know if you will be able to attend.  Thanks!  Marie   Dianne S.  We will conference you in. 
 We have a scheduling conflict with our conference rooms.  Is everyone available from 9:00-10:00 Wednesday, October 10?  Same conference room.  Sorry!  Marie 
 So what was her beef if the copies were for our people? 
 Oh, please!  The exhibits should have been organized and conformed prior to execution. 
 Hi, Derek!  Any word on where we stand on this master agreement?  Hope all is well.  Marie 
  Another follow-up message re status of execution of master agreement.  Please advise.  Thanks!  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Hi, Tracy!  Where do we stand on Allegheny?  We really would like to finalize this master ASAP.  Thanks!  Marie 
 No, you can do power. 
 Donna:  I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.  Do we want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?  Marie 
 We don't have to wait until the board meeting.  We do a unanimous written consent and circulate among the directors for signature. 
  I never received a response to my 9/17 e-mail to you re this amalgamation.  Are there any credit issues with respect to this amalgamation?  Thanks!  Marie 
 The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow from 9-10 in EB38C2. 
 Ms. Lemont:  It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc. signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.  Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the corporate documentation? 
 We have been advised by Mary Kay Lemont that Bear Stearns will not open this new account until they have all corporate documentation in place.  ECT Europe Finance, Inc. does not have resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, so we are currently preparing corporate resolutions to circulate for signature.  Will the authorized traders in this account be those authorized to trade on Enron Credit's behalf?  If so, will you provide me with a current list?  Additionally, is this the only position that will be in this account?  Thanks!  Marie 
  Arthur has surfaced!  But why he's plodding through it is beyond me.  He said he was ready to sign so that's why we sent execution copies.  Obviously he hadn't even reviewed the draft.  Go figure!  Marie 
 Sooner than January?  I'll let you know if I hear of anything.  I'm sure Mark H. is planning on you just integrating into ENA's legal group. 
 Susan:  Jorge Garcia on the interest rate and currency desk forwarded this e-mail to me requesting certain RMT masters.  Thanks!  Marie 
  Susan:  I think this is yours.  Thanks! 
 Yes 
 Mr. Guinn:  I have the Second Amendment signed by Enron North America and evidently deleted your e-mail regarding who I should send copies to for execution?  Will you please provide me once again with this information?  Thanks!  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Jeff:  I have the documents ready to be signed in connection with opening the referenced account.  Can you assist me in getting them signed?  The officers who can sign are:  Any one of:  Mark Frevert Ben Glisan John Sherriff  together with any one of:  Rick Buy Rick Carson  Since we don't know the ins and outs as to why we are opening this account for this entity, Sara suggested that you or someone in your shop contact one of the officers from each group to explain the account and ask them to sign the documents.  Once you have determined who will sign, let me know and I'll take care of routing them for signature and getting them to Bear Stearns.  Thanks for your help!  Marie 
 Mary Kay:  I am routing the documents for signature now.  Will fax them to you when si= gned.  Marie 
 Gordon:  Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced transaction, together with a fax cover page.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Mary Kay:  I am faxing to you this morning those documents that we have signed so far.= Will you send me your physical delivery address so that I can send the or= iginals to you?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Exceptions:  Vacation Day - 10/5.  Thanks! 
 Yes.  They are sending their originals to us so that we can put them all together and distribute. 
 Tanya:  Will you provide me with a definition of "Capital Reserves" which you used in the CSFB (Europe) worksheet?  Thanks!  Marie 
 If you are still in Houston tomorrow and get the urge to initial the ISDA, please call Samantha Boyd at 39188 and she will be happy to either show you where they are or send them to you (wherever you may be).  Thanks!  Marie 
 Rebecca:  Attached is the Annex B for Deal No. YA2985.1.  Please attach Annex A, Annex B and the Canadian Annex, since this is a cross border transaction.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I had no interaction with her, so can't comment. 
 YUK! 
 Cindy:  Attached is a form of Enron Corp. guaranty that we are required to deliver in connection with a confirmation.  Please process this guaranty by the end of day tomorrow, as I must overnight it to the counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Cindy:  Mary Perkins executed an amendment to the Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of Bear Stearns, et al on May 15, 2001.  The original guaranty guaranteed obligations of Enron Credit Inc. under a brokerage arrangement.  Bear Stearns has requested a certificate of incumbency with Mary's specimen signature.  I have prepared and am attaching such certificate.  If acceptable, please have Mary sign and Kate (or another asst. secretary) certify.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Laurel and Jorge:  Attached is the form of confirmation for Credit Suisse First Boston London Branch.  ENA is the confirming party and calculation agent.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now.  The resolution (Jeff does not sign) will have to follow.  Please provide me with the contact information so that I can forward the documents to CSFB (phone, fax and courier delivery address).  Marie 
 I am having it looked at and will 
 I am having it looked at and will send it down this afternoon.

 Hi, Robbi!  How are things going?  Any more news?  We have finally decided on our fabric and the amount of yardage.  What's the next step?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Roeline!  Just checking on the status of the original assignments I forwarded to you for execution.  Have you received them back from UOM, Dynegy and Sempra?  If so, will you send me an original of each for my files?  Hope all is going well and that you have a great weekend.  Marie 
 Hi, Sheila!  Can you verify for us the account numbers at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that we need to assign back into?  Thanks!  Marie

 Oops, forgot about lunch.  I'm available Monday or Tuesday.  Just let me know if either works for you.  Marie 
  Ed:  Attached are AES's comments to our draft ISDA.  Please respond to those which are credit related.  Thanks!  Marie 
 No, you can send them all together.  I was just trying to clean some stacks of paper off my desk and realized that I hadn't received the originals.  Thanks for your further assistance on this.  Marie 
 I thought you were going to come by and initial the master agreement.  I can't get it signed until you initial.  Will you please initial the two pages I faxed to you on 8/13 and fax back to me ASAP so that I can have the agreement signed here in Houston?  Thanks. 
 Richard:  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I am working on finalizing our comments to send back to AA today.  Marie 
 Todd:  At last, I am attaching our response to your comments of 7/19/01, together with a clean and blacklined draft of the ISDA Master Agreement for Georgia Power Company.

 Richard:  As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.  Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Richard:  Thanks for the info.  I'll send it overnight to her and will copy you on my correspondence (with a copy of our comments).  Marie 
 Patrick and Rebecca:  Attached are the Deemed ISDAs for the referenced counterparties.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I don't know.  Which entity did the weather trade? 
 Sounds great!  Sorry we won't be able to help move, unpack, babysit (or should I say "queensit") but unfortunately we'll be celebrating Anne's birthday (no, not her 34th!) the same day!  Hopefully we'll make it up your way next year to visit and most importantly, meet "The Queen".  Love,  Marie 
 Mr. Ellis:  Pursuant to your request, I am attaching for your review the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.

 Here is the executed masters list.  We will try to get you guys on the distribution list, but if we can't we'll just forward the e-mail to you.  Is there anyone else in your group we should add to the list?  Marie 
 That's fine.  They probably want the original.  Marie 
 I don't know who Debbie Nicholls is either. 
 I did and she did. 
 Hi, Roeline!  Eric faxed me a copy of the assignment and new confirmation signed by Sempra but I have not seen the originals.  Marie 
 We have received a certificate of amalgamation evidencing the merger of Pacifica Papers Inc. with and into Norske Skog Canada Limited, with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.  I have received verification from Credit that they are okay with this amalgamation.  I will forward a copy of the documentation to Global Counterparty.  Marie 
 Cheryl:  We have received a certificate of amalgamation evidencing the amalgamation of Pacifica Papers Inc. with and into Norske Skog Canada Limited with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.  Credit is aware of this and has no problems.  I will forward copies of the documentation to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Marie 
 I wish I could, but I have a paralegal lunch today. 
 Cindy:  Attached are a form of Enron Corp. guaranty and certificate of incumbency to be executed in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement with Pursue Energy Corporation.  Please call me when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pickup.  Thanks!  Marie 
  This is cute. 
 Hi, Robbi!  Hope you are enjoying your time off.  I know I certainly enjoyed Friday and Tuesday and hated to come back today.  Anne and I went to the Decorative Center yesterday, and tried to check out some samples at Beacon Hill (Robert Allen Fabrics) and they couldn't find your account.  Do you have an account there, or was I mistaken?  Anyway, I thought I'd e-mail you since I don't have your home number in case you were going to the Decorative Center later this week to see if you could check out some samples for us if you had time.  At Beacon Hill  (Robert Allen):  Pattern:  Bearnson Color:  Aged Gold  Pattern:  Scholtes Color:  Cinnabar  Pattern:  McGeary Color:  Citron  At Brunschwig & Fils (Gaston y Daniela):  Pattern No.:  82315-198 Name:  Chevron Woven Texture Color:  Teja  Pattern No.:  82315 - 401 Name:  Chevron Woven Texture Color:  Verde Agua  At Schumacher & Co. (Greeff)  Pattern No.:  3185017 Name:  Ephemera Color:  Grass  Pattern No.:  3185046 Name:  Ephemera Color:  Bittersweet  Pattern No.:  3112096 Name:  Alpine Color:  Pumpkin  If you don't go back to DC or have already gone, we can maybe find the Robert Allen samples at Expo. They sell his fabrics there.  Thanks!  We really appreciate your help.  Marie 
 Yes, please.  Also, please add taxes.  We certainly don't want to do anything that will mess his records up since you all are so kind to do this.  Do you want us to pay in advance?  That won't be a problem either.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Well, I guess that's why they get to have such nice, pretty stores.  What's Eric doing up here meeting with the attorneys?  Also, Jane said that Mary Nell and Peter were given packages?  Is this true? 
 Do we have a conflict?  The CA will be to obtain financials.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Glad you enjoyed them! 
 I bet Mary Nell was made that they wouldn't let her come back to Houston.  I haven't heard anything.  I know that several of our lawyers and Carol have been meeting to finalize a Master Netting agreement.  There are some issues with the master netting agreement and some of the big financing transactions.  Maybe that's what they are working on.  If I hear anything, I'll let you know. 
 That makes sense since we have that SEC inquiry going on. 
  My sentiments exactly! 
  Did I send this to you already?

 Hi, Matt!  How's the new job going?  Things are so crazy here, it's unbelievable!  My e-mail where you forwarded the proposed resolutions to me was automatically deleted.  Can you send it to me again, or tell me where I can find the documents?  Thanks!  Marie

 Esmeralda:  I'm available.  Thanks!  Marie 
 I'm just now going through my e-mails from last week as I was out cleaning up after the flood.  I had given Cynthia the omnibus forms before I left, so I don't know what they are doing/not doing up there.  Marie 
 WHAT????????  How can this be?  Who allowed this to happen?  What are we going to do?  There is no one worthy to take your place as favorite credit person.  Those structuring people can't possibly be nicer than us.  I guess I wish you well, although it's going to be bad for us.  Oh, as far as the HUGE Happy Hour, I hope you aren't getting your hopes up too high.  Remember, it's Bill!  Seriously, we will miss you and I wish you all the best.  Marie 
 Hi, Bernice!  I don't think Legal needs to review your correspondence requesting this information, but we will still need to receive copies of the name changes, mergers, etc.  Thanks!  Marie

 Tracy:  Will you handle this?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Tiffany:   Attached is the revised Annex B for the omnibus confirmation.  We have addressed the counterparty's concerns as follows:  1.	Annual vs. monthly financial statements - the annex provides for delivery of annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements.  It does not require delivery of monthly financial statements.  2.	We have revised Annex B to be 2- way, meaning that the provisions apply to both the counterparty and ENA.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie

 Steve:  I have sent the amendment to the Agency Agreement to Gary Hickerson for signature on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  When executed, I will fax you a copy.  How do you want to handle obtaining Michael Brown's signature?  Do you want me to send the original to you and you will coordinate getting his signature, or do you want me to send it to Michael directly?  I know Michael, so I don't have a problem with sending it directly to him, or I can certainly send it to someone in Legal in London to coordinate getting his signature.  Please let me know how you want to handle this.  In addition, I made a few minor changes to the amendment.  ECT Investments' name is ECT Investments, Inc. with a comma between "Investments" and "Inc.".  Also, Gary Hickerson is President of ECT Investments rather than Managing Director, and I also added his and Michael's middle initials.

 Ed:  Attached are the following:  1.	ConEd's form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 and  2.	Our comparison of the above documents.  Please review the following credit related items and let me know if you are okay with ConEd's language or if you would prefer our revision:  1.	Part 1(c) - "Cross Default" - ConEd has left in the provision re cross acceleration, which we usually take out, but leave in if our counterparty is a financial institution.  2.	Part 1(d) - "Credit Event Upon Merger" - will you agree to ConEd's language?  Also, I know you said that we were just going to comment on ConEd's version without credit, but Sara wanted to know if you want to include cross-default thresholds and the same matrix we are using in the two specific transactions.  Please let me have your response to the above as soon as possible so that we can send our comments to ConEd, as they are getting pretty agitated that we are taking so long.  Thanks!  Marie

 Kristina:  My CompareRite feature is not working right now, but I can point out the changes we made.  The changes we made were to the final revised form that Carol St. Clair prepared, so for the most part, the changes are the same as hers with these exceptions:  1.	Preamble - "Enron Power Marketing, Inc." has been changed to "Enron North America Corp., formerly known as Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".  2.	First "WHEREAS" paragraph - "WHEREAS, ....identified on Exhibits A and B hereto (whether one or more referred to herein collectively as the "Transactions"), under the ISDA Master Agreement dated May 14, 1998...;".  3.	Second "WHEREAS" paragraph - changed "a" to "an" before "Assignment Agreement dagted April 25, 2001".  4.	Paragraph 3 - changed "Consent and Assignment" to "Consent to Assignment".  5.	Paragraph 8 - "As of...that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of June 16, 1992...".  6.	Signature Line changed from "Enron Power Marketing, Inc." to "Enron North America Corp., formerly known as Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".  7.	Added Exhibit A (Natural Gas Transactions) and Exhibit B (Basis Swaps).  If my CompareRite starts working, I'll try to send you a blacklined copy.  Marie 
 I spoke with Frank about your proposed changes and he was okay with your first change, however,  the definition of "Investment Policy" does appear in Section 5(c)(i).  What documentation sets forth your investment objectives, restrictions, etc.?  Also, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached to the ISDA?  Finally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal opinion.

 Hi, Jaime:  Attached are the revised draft ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13, reflecting the counterparty's collateral threshold to be "$7,000,000" rather than "$5,000,000".  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Janelle:  As a condition to ENA entering into any new transactions with ConEd, Credit is requiring that ConEd execute the Amendment to Confirmation for Deal No. 514094.01 (to make sure both deals have identical credit).  Should you enter into a transaction with ConEd, and they haven't signed the amendment to the existing transaction, the new transaction may have to be unwound.

 CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!  We've been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "Babies Elliott" had arrived.  Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size, and that Mom is doing well.  Look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones.  I know you all are going to have so much fun with them.  Hope you've been storing up sleep, cause it looks like you won't be getting much for a while.  Again, congratulations.  These three little ones don't realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad, but I'm sure they'll find out soon.  Take care  Marie

Also, has Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. provided any incoming guaranties and, if so, do we want to consolidate those?  Marie 
 Francisco has requested that anytime we email a Deemed ISDA for a Mexican counterparty to the Confirm Desk, we ask them to return a copy, signed by the counterparty, to us as soon as they receive it back.  When we receive the signed copy, we should give it to Francisco.  Thanks!  Marie

  Aparna:  Regarding your e-mail asking us to prepare a confidentiality agreement, below is an e-mail from Tana Jones forwarding two forms of CAs to Credit so that you all can prepare your CAs requesting financials without having to ask Legal to prepare it.  The CA must be initialed by a lawyer prior to signing by either Bill or Rick, and a copy of the fully executed CA must be sent to Kay Young in Legal.  Let us know if you have any questions.  Marie 
 Joe:  Attached is the Annex B for each of Wexford Spectrum Investors LLC and Solitair Corp.  As I stated in my voicemail, please do not send these out until you get the okay from either Frank Sayre or me.  We are waiting to receive the underlying documentation from Caroline Abramo re eligibility, etc.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 That's okay.  I'll call you before I leave. 
 Tony:  Attached are forms of resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage agreements, together with a form of authorized traders list.  I don't know if Sara told you or not, but we typically require two signatories to open brokerage accounts.  Presently, our resolutions reflect Cassandra Schultz, Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a Division of Enron Corp. as being authorized, however, we have just learned that she hasn't been officially elected to this office, so in the interim, we will have Rick Buy be our second signature.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie x33907 
  Jim:  Attached is the form of confidentiality agreement that Sara made reference to in her voice mail.  Thanks!  Marie 
 I hope to have the signed guaranty today.  All the Enron Corp. officers authorized to sign guaranties were out the latter part of last week, so the Legal Department was going to have to find someone today to sign the guaranties.  As soon as I receive it, I will fax it to you and send the original, together with the other documents to you by overnight courier.  Marie 
 Hi, Tanya!  Jay said that he has passed AK Steel along to you to look at.  I told him that I thought things were passed down the chain, not up and he said that when you are as good as he his, they are passed up the chain.  You may have something different to say about this.  Anyway, Chris Motley at AK is calling checking on the status of the ISDA.  We originally were going to have it signed, but when Samantha called Jay about initialling, he said Credit wanted to revisit the credit, so can you let me know the status so that I can tell Chris?  Thanks!  Marie 
 I was wondering who Miguel was and now I know. 
 In connection with Tana Jones' e-mail of July 12, 2001, I am attaching revised forms of the Credit Confidentiality Agreements for use in requesting financial statements from a counterparty.  Please begin using the attached forms when preparing confidentiality agreements and please refer to Tana's e-mail regarding procedures for preparing and signing the agreements.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at x33907.

 Hi, Candace:  Yes, I have received the document and will do my best to get it signed today and returned to you by fax.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Max:  I will get the amendment to you today.  Marie 
 Credit has been instructed that either Rick Buy or Bill can sign the CA's.  Since these were strictly for financials (and signed by Enron Corp.), we weren't going to enter them into our database, but Kay Young is going to keep a copy in her files.  Do you have any suggestions or comments otherwise? 
 Max:  Per our conversation, attached is the draft First Amendment to Master Agreement.  If these changes are acceptable to the counterparty, they can either sign two originals and send to us for signature or, we can sign first and then forward to them.  If they have any questions, they can call either Frank Sayre (x57894) or me (x33907).  Thanks!  Marie

 Sheila:  We prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements (the ones dated 11/30/2000), which authorized Cassandra to be a second signatory, however, the problem arose when we tried to get Kate Cole in the Corporate Secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for Cassandra.  Cassandra has never officially been elected to the office of Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control, a division of Enron Corp., so as far as the corporate records are concerned, she is not officially a Vice President.  This will be resolved at the Enron Corp. Board Meeting in August and her appointment will be retroactive to November 1, 2000.  Until such time as this has occurred, she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents.  Marie 
 Hi, Wendi!  Attached is a form of multiparty/multiproduct guaranty that we would like for a counterparty to provide to us.  I checked with Tana and she said that this is the form we would use whether EOL or verbal transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 It's Rob Cass. 
 I'll take a look at it and run it by one of the other lawyers. 
 I checked and Sara sent a message to Credit on 3/26/01 but obviously has had no response.  You may want to respond to Mr. Martin and let him know that Sara did receive his message and that we were waiting on our Credit Department to respond and we will send them (Credit) another reminder that we are waiting to hear from them. 
 Tanya:  Sara received a request from FPL's outside counsel in March asking to execute an ISDA for the entity that trades for the non-regulated business units of the regulated entity, Florida Power & Light Co.  He is offering the guaranty of FPL Group Capital Inc.  Sara sent a copy of her Lotus Notes entry to you all asking someone to respond.  Today, she received another e-mail re status?  Russell worked on the Florida Power & Light Co. master.  Do you know who is or will be working on this, assuming it is something we want to do?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Kim:  I have been asked by our corporate paralegal to assist him in cleaning up the ENA corporate database as those individuals who have been appointed agent and attorney-in-fact to sign confirmations in connection with financial transactions.  Mary Cook has a copy of an e-mail in the file to Brenda Herod setting forth the procedures and telling her that you verify the requests and notify Legal of any changes.  In this e-mail, apparently Brenda asked that Mike Moscoso's and Kristen Hanson's appointments be revoked and that Lisa McClendon be added.  Will you let me know of any changes that should be made at this time?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Okay.  I thought you already had an account with them.  My mistake.  Also, do you have an account with Kravet?  We found a piece of their fabric that we really liked.  How was your vacation?  I'm sure you're glad to be back!  Marie 
 I already did. 
 Thanks! 
 YES!!!!!  I have to get money. 
 No problem.  I'll get them to you shortly. 
 Kim:  We are in the process of cleaning this mess up. Sally Beck and Rogers Herndon are both given power of attorney to sign confirmations and they are both officers of ENA, so they can already sign documents.  Go figure!  If it's not too much trouble for you to verify those who should be removed then I can double check against my list.  I don't want to remove someone who should be left, nor do I want to leave someone on who should be removed.  Thanks for your help.  P.S.  For timing purposes, we are shooting for Monday to finalize documentation.

 Jim:  In connection with the upcoming Enron Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared, and attach for your review, resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, the interest rate and currency desk typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers.  Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.  The attached resolutions are substantially like the ones ENA has adopted in connection with the opening of brokerage accounts.  ENA also requires two officers to sign documents to open brokerage accounts, but allows only one officer to sign subsequent documentation and to give instructions to the brokers.  Would you please review the attached resolutions and advise if they are acceptable so that we can submit them to Rebecca Carter  by tomorrow, August 1.  Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions.  Marie x33907

 Rebecca:  In connection with the upcoming Enron Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, Gary Hickerson's group typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers to authorize the transfer of funds from Enron Corp.'s brokerage account(s), in particular the account at Morgan Stanley.  Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.  The attached resolutions have been drafted using the December 13, 1994 resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, with the exception of the deletion of non-existing offices, change in officer titles and the addition of Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain.  I am attaching a copy of the certificate we sent to Morgan Stanley in connection with the opening of the account for Enron Corp. certifying the December 13, 1994 resolutions.

I am attaching forms of the certificates listed as items 2 and 3 above.  If GAF needs the IRS W-9, they can go to their website at www.irs.gov and download a copy.  ENA will be providing a Certificate of Incumbency, certifying its articles of incorporation and bylaws and the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of ENA, together with a Certificate certifying resolutions as to its authority to enter into financial transactions and an IRS W-9.

  Tanya:  I don't remember if I forwarded this on or not.  When we receive counterparties' paper, should we forward on to you or would you prefer we send them to Jay or someone else?  Marie 
 I think it will be okay for them to sign.  They will need to print and sign two originals and return both copies to you.  Both David and John will need to initial before the agreements can be signed by an authorized officer.  Additionally, our notice information will need to be completed.  Once signed by Uecomm and returned to you, please let me know so that we can process the Enron Corp. guaranty or will David process it from your end?  Also, I don't know if you will keep the original in Australia or if it will come back to Houston.  Robbi, do you know?  We can cross that bridge once it is fully executed.  Hope this isn't too confusing!  Marie 
  Tracy:  Can you send the latest long haul SLAs to Pat since I don't have access to them.  If you're not sure which ones to send, check with Robbi.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Okay. 
 I don't blame you.  Obviously she's not dependable and her heart isn't in it, not to mention the fact that she doesn't know what she's doing and I don't think she wants to learn.  That was pretty obvious when I was training her--she never seemed to be interested in the job, otherwise she would have tried to learn all she could and would have at least taken some pride in her work.

 I have provided everyone with a copy of the self study guide "From Edison to Enron - an Evolution". 
 Celeste:  We are reviewing ISDA opinions to verify if a Hong Kong entity can enter into derivative transactions.  Once we confirm that they can, we will send the form Deemed ISDA to you.  Marie 
 Hi, Jay!  Just received a call from Adam at XTO Energy and he is going to be sending an e-mail with their comments to the ISDA.  He said there were just a handful, but we'll see.  I'll forward his e-mail to you when I receive it.  Have a good weekend!  Marie 
  Here are XTO's comments. Please respond to those that are credit related, which appear to be most of them.  Lucky you!  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Joe:  Tana said I should forward this e-mail to you and that you guys would prepare the assignment and send to us for review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Please note that all of the deals, with the exception of the first one, are EOL deals.  Thanks for your help.  Marie 
 Attached for your further handling is the Annex B for the related transaction.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I'm preparing the Master Agreement for execution between Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd. and the referenced counterparty.  Please let me know the date of the earliest outstanding trade (if any) so that I can date my master agreement.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Mr. Sill  Pursuant to your request, attached is the execution copy of the Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd. and Uecomm Operations Pty Limited.  Please print two (2) copies of the document and have an authorized officer sign both copies on Page 6 of the agreement.  When executed, please forward both original signed copies by overnight courier to Mr. David Minns at Level 21, 9 Castlereagh St., Sydney, NSW  2000, Australia, Telephone No. (612) 9229 2310  I will process the Enron Corp.

Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Hi, David:  As you can see, I have forwarded the master agreement to Mr. Sill for execution.  When you receive the executed copies, please complete the notice information on the Schedule.  I'm sure Pat can assist in the technical contacts if you aren't familiar with them.  In addition, please initial both copies and have John Suttle initial both copies before they are signed by EBS Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd.  Upon execution, please forward one fully signed copy to Mr. Sill and forward the other original copy to me in Houston.  I am processing the original Enron Corp. guaranty and will forward it to Uecomm when I receive it back from Enron Corp. and receive confirmation from you that you have the master agreement as signed by Uecomm.  Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie   Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp.

 Will you e-mail me your form guaranty?  Thanks! 
 Hi, Cindy:  I'm assisting EBS in some of their trading work for awhile, so this is why I am sending you the attached memo requesting an Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Please let me know when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pick-up.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Becky:  I left early yesterday (as did everyone else) so I have no comments. 
 Hi, Nidia!  Per my voice mail, attached is the revised form of guaranty to add "Process Agent" section.  Please send this revised form to the counterparty asking that they use this form rather than the form of guaranty you sent them on Friday.  Let us know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Marie 
  Samantha:  Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.  He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.  I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.  Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.  Let me know if you have questions or need help.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Gordon:  We have received the draft ISDA Master Agreement back from Nemak, S.A. which they have executed.  It appears to be in order, so I am in the process of preparing it for execution by us.  The effective date on the agreement is July 30, 2001.  We can confirm transactions with them under this Master Agreement.  Once ENA has executed the document, I will send the general e-mail to everyone as usual.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Thanks, that's nice to hear! 
 Hi, Tracy!  I couldn't remember if I was supposed to send you the final copy of the Schedule and Paragraph 13 or not, so what the heck, here they are!  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Veronica!  Have you had a chance to review their comments?  Marie 
 Mark:  I am attaching a revised list.  I forgot to show EBS, not that is has created a significant amount of work. Thanks!  Marie 
 Did you get this? 
 I will be out this Friday, August 17. 
 Mr. Cooper:  Pursuant to Darren Vanek's request, I am forwarding a form of multi-product/multi-affiliate guaranty.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions.

 KINDLY FIND?  There's nothing "Kindly" about 4 credit worksheets.  In fact, we kindly reject them. 
  Will you gladly look at these four too? 
  Per Legal/Credit meeting. 
 Ed:  I just received these from Niagra Mohawk.  I don't know if they are the same as the ones I sent to Tanya last week that she said she forwarded on to you to assign.  Marie 
 Hi, Joe!  Per my voicemail, will you send me the two confirms for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP and AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund Ltd.  I need to make some changes to them.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Angie!  I am just writing to check on the status of your review of the draft ISDA Master Agreement I forwarded to you.  Will you please let me know when you anticipate sending your comments?

 Bob:  Mark Taylor said I should forward this to you for review.  If this is not the case, please let me know.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Hi, Max!  Francisco Pinto-Leite asked me to forward this draft to you to review the additional credit terms.  Please review the definition of "Independent Amount" on page 2 of Annex A and the definitions of "Base Volume" and "Incremental Volume" on pages 6 and 7 of Annex A and let us know if this is what you want, or please revise as you would like.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Joe:  Attached are the revised confirms for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund L.P. (V41967.5) and AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund Ltd. (V41967.4).  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie x33907 
  Alan:  Francisco asked me to send you the revised guaranty form.  Marie 
 Hi, Maribel:  I don't know if you were copied on Tana Jones's e-mail, but Legal is preparing all confidentiality agreements once again, so instead of you having to prepare the agreement, if you will just provide us with the counterparty info (name, address, contact, etc.) we will prepare the CA, have initialled and forward to you for signature.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Wendi:  You don't believe everything Tana tells you, do you?  Haven't you realized she's just trying to get out of work?  At least now you know who really does the work in the Swap Group.  We will prepare your CA for you (since Tana won't).  Will you send Poli-Twine's address and fax number?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Not a thing! 
 Wendi:  Attached for your further handling is the referenced CA.  When you receive the signed document from Poli-Twine, please have it initialled by a lawyer before having Bill sign.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie x33907 
 At the request of Ross Mesquita, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions, please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3907.  We look forward to hearing from you.

 FYI 
 Attached for your review are clean and blacklined drafts of each of the following:  1.	Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - Enron North America Corp. and Catequil Partners, L.P.  2.	Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - Enron North America Corp. and Catequil Overseas Partners, Ltd.  We have revised the definition of "Net Asset Value" set forth in Part 5(p)(b) of each agreement and feel this will take care of the issues.  Please provide us with the date of the investment management agreement for each fund.  In addition, please verify that Catequil Associates LLC is the correct party to sign both agreements as general partner of each of the limited partnerships.  Please do not hesitate to contact Frank Sayre (713/345-7894; frank.sayre@enron.com) or me with any questions or comments.  We look forward to hearing your comments. 
 I'm okay. 
 Hallelujah!  Maybe now we won't go through as much paper as before. 
 Matt:  Here is the proposed language re appointing agents and attorneys-in-fact to sign confirmations.  We may need to run these by Mark Taylor for approval, as he approves the trading resolutions.  We need to make the appointments effective as of 5/1/01.  Also, Bryan Burnett, Edward Ondarza and Stewart Seeligson are with EBS, so I don't know if they are still officers of ENA.  Didn't Max Yzaguirre leave Enron altogether?  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Joe:  Attached are a clean and blacklined copy of the Partial Termination.  We have revised it to reflect a "new" transaction rather than a "replacement" transaction, since the existing transaction is still in place.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Tanya/Jay:  Have you looked into the 4 Peoples-related worksheets that Rudwell sent us to verify if we want to go ahead and draft ISDAs to send to them?  Please let us know if we should go ahead and draft or not.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Thanks!  If anyone should apologize for not responding in a timely fashion it should be me.  I'll work on preparing these documents and should have something to you soon.  Marie 
 Thank you for all your hard work.  This is something that has needed to be done, but no one would take the initiative.  Let's just hope all your hard work makes it to the datasheet.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Carol:  The only one I found in our database is SMBC Capital Markets.  Sara was working on this back in 1998 for Enron Corp.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Marie 
 Adam:  I have passed your comments along to our Credit Department and am waiting for a response.  I will touch base with them.  Hopefully we can wrap this up soon.

 Exception:  9/5 - Vacation  thanks! 
  Jay:  I responded to Adam and told him that our Credit Department was reviewing the comments and that I would check on the status.  Marie 
 Ms. Rosenthal:  Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).  Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp. guaranty.  You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with reviewing same.  Thank you.

 Hi, Patrick:  Can you provide me with the date for Deal No. VT2401.1?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Robbi!  Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.  How are things going now that Lance and Carol are there?  Hopefully, better.  Mark gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.  Kristina managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, Mark  saw right through them.  Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.  We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.  If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.  We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.  Would you let me know?  Also, we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane.  What is best for you?  Talk to you later.  Mare 
  Hi, Greg!  Wendy Conwell in Credit here in Houston forwarded this worksheet to us to prepare an omnibus confirmation for a deal between ECC and Atco Electric.  Since you guys are preparing confirms up there, I am forwarding the worksheet to you to prepare.  Francisco Pinto-Leite is marking up the counterparty form of guaranty and will forward it to you also.  Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
  Hi, Mark!  Francisco asked me to forward this e-mail to you in Greg's absence.  Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Don't worry.  That's why we're here--to keep you on your toes. 
  Susan:  Sara received this e-mail from First Union regarding the ISDA with Enron Corp.  Per Lotus Notes, you are working with Sara on this.  Is this something you can handle, or should it wait until Sara returns?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Gordon!  This is a Chilean counterparty that Nidia Mendoza in Credit asked us to prepare a "sample" Deemed ISDA for.  This is all I know, which probably isn't much.  Marie 
 Cindy:  Attached for your further handling are an Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of the The City of Glendale, together with related secretary's certificates.  Please let me know when the documents have been signed and I'll arrange for pickup.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Celeste:  Are there deal terms that the lawyer can use to review the confirm?  If not, what are they specifically reviewing?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Robbi:  Friday would be great for us, as long as it's not going to put you in a bind since you are trying to get out for vacation.  Also, yes, I would like to look at your catalog.  I'm so glad we're bosom buddies!  We will offer our painting services to you if you want to do a faux finish at your new home.  Marie 
 I just received this e-mail from Todd Perkins at Southern Co. 
 Hi, Cindy:  Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of March 29, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing Enron Credit Inc.'s obligations under a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were originally executed by ENA and assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  Andy Fastow signed this guaranty.  Bear Stearns is now asking for certificates as to authority and incumbency, so I have prepared and attach them for processing.  In addition, Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of February 20, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing ENA's obligations under the Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were subsequently assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  We asked Bear Stearns to return the original Enron Corp. guaranty and apparently they have lost it.  In this regard, I am attaching a form of termination for that guaranty.  If it is in order, please process it for signature.  Thanks for your help and if you have any questions or need anything else, please let me know.  Marie x33907 
 I don't think another e-mail would be rude.  It's rude that she hasn't responded to our other requests.  Do you want to send it or do you want me to.  I'll be happy to.  Marie 
  FYI.  What's the big deal in CSFB not sending us their form of schedule until we send the form of Enron Corp. guaranty and said that ECT Investments will collateralize its trades?  Marie 
 Tanya:  You'll love this.  ALCOA has sent us an amendment to the ISDA (that was signed 1/99) and wants to amend the "threshold amount" in Part 1 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in Paragraph 13.  I think we are mixing apples and oranges!  Obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the ISDA in '99.  And it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master.  Marie 
 Mr. Giordano:  Attached are the final blacklined drafts of the ISDA Master Agreements for Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd. and Catequil Partners L.P., which incorporate your comments sent to us on 8/22.  With respect to "Valuation and Timing", we just inadvertently left that comment in, but have now deleted it.  Please let us know if the final comments are acceptable to you and, if so, we will finalize copies for execution.  Thanks!  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp.

 Oops, sorry! 
 Thanks, Veronica.  Brent Hendry is going to call you about Todd Perkins' e-mail.  We don't want to enter into an ISDA with an agency arrangement as it poses problems as far as netting and other matters.  Brent will call Todd and tell him that we will either enter into 6 separate masters or one master with Southern and then they can internally back to back trades.  So, I would not do anything until Brent speaks with you and Todd.  Marie 
 I would like the Roasted Chicken Cobb Salad, with no eggs, if possible, and vinaigrette dressing.  Oh, and extra sugar cookies, please!  Thanks!  Marie 
 Oops, sorry!  Here they are!  Marie 
 Lissa:  Attached is the proposed form of guaranty that Enron Corp. will provide.  ECT Investments would only collateralize above the threshold, since you would have a guaranty for the rest.  We look forward to receiving your form of schedule.  Marie 
 Lissa:  I must be having problems with my e-mail as I tried to reply to yours and was told it couldn't be delivered, so that's why I'm sending you a new one rather than a reply.

 Thanks.  I was able to open them.  Marie 
 I don't have it. 
 Veronica:  Will you look at the "Transfer" section on Page 11 of the Schedule and let me know if you are okay with their change?  Thanks!  Marie 
 No.  Thanks for asking. 
 You can go to the IRS website at www.irs.gov and download copies of the appropriate tax forms. 
 Mr. Flett:  I am close to finishing the review of your draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and was hoping to receive your Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex to review so that I can present them both to Sara Shackleton for final review upon her return from vacation on September 4.

 Yes, I got the copy.  I will send you a copy of the guaranty when I receive it. 
  David:  Your counterparty is being impossible.  Please see their latest message below.  They won't even send us their draft ISDA until we provide them with every little bit of info.  This is only a draft, not the final one.  It can and probably will be negotiated.  Thanks!  Marie 
  This is pretty eerie! 
 Here it is! 
 Kim:  Attached for your further handling are a clean and blacklined draft of the revised Schedule and Paragraph 13 for the City of Glendale.  We will try to verify the outside counsel to use in connection with rendering the legal opinion so that we can begin that process.  If we have any problems, it may have to wait until Sara Shackleton returns on 9/4 since she is more familiar with who we use and what the extent of the engagement will be.

 Hi, Una:  Per my voice mail, we need a copy of a representative sample of whatever documentation BNP Paribas and Enron Metals Limited transact under (ISDA, general terms and conditions, etc.).

 Thanks, it's a pleasure working with you too.  I just wish it had been under better circumstances. 
 Matt:  You can ignore the voice mail I left you a few minutes ago.  William Morley is going to send me copies of the documentation.  Marie 
 Unless by trading group they meant the actual traders--we're just the lawyers and staff.  I'll send you an e-mail tonight when I can talk--if you get my drift. 
 Thanks for sending this.  I just spoke with Randy Miller and told him that we probably wouldn't get it to him today, but we would certainly send it over on Monday morning.  Samantha is working on it.

 Hi, Robbi!  I've been meaning to call you, but as you can imagine, it's been extremely busy here.  Hope you're okay and I'll try to talk with you soon.  No, we still haven't received anything from Robert Allen to return our fabric.  I was hoping they would send something last week, because we shipped our gifts to Washington and we could have sent it at the same time.  Let me know what you hear from them.  Let's try to get together after the 1st.  I know it's going to be too busy this week and next, so why don't we shoot for after the new year.  If I don't talk to you soon have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!  Marie

We will have our assistants bring coffee, etc., so if you will let us know when the groups arrive at the data room, we will take care of that.  Thanks!  Marie 
 I don't think we'll have anything for you today.  I know you'll be so upset that you aren't needed today.  Thanks for asking.  Marie 
 Thanks, Happy New Year to you too! 
  The one from Tana is a picture, but if you scroll down further, I think it is the Bin Laden song, so there is sound with that one.  I also sent it home in case you can't open it or want to listen at home.
