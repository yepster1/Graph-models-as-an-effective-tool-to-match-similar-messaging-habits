 Possible contract candidate. 
 please respond.  MHC 
 Lance,  Kim was here on Friday.  I have asked Mark Taylor for his thoughts.  Michelle 
 Will do.  I've asked Diane to send you the legal advice we received.  I've finalized the template today, and should have a draft out tomorrow (Monday).  Michelle 
 No, this is not.  I am curious as to how this got to you.  I will give it a review and get back with you. 
 Freudian slip, I'm sure.  See you tomorrow!  Michelle 
  FYI -- see what you can find out about this -- perfect opportunity to market OLER's services.  Thanks  MHC 
 Fran, would you mind pulling the data for GSP on this.  It is strange that we should be paying unemployment rates for GSP, since it is its own entity, separate and apart from Enron.  Do you know anything about the other transactions? 
 Sure, sounds like a good plan to put the flag in Personic to discuss the time limitations.  Other than the specific gas-related folks, I am not aware of a non-solicit of AEP employees.  I'll double check to confirm, though.  MHC 
 Alan,  I understand that you have approved the request below.  Is this because they are WRA personnel?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI, with apologies if I already sent this to ya'll. 
 please print this plus all attachments.  MHC 
 The consent form should be kept in PH file.   The background check results should be maintained separately.  MHC 
 Not a problem if the employee does not date it.  The issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company.  MHC 
 Kathy, we should go ahead and remove these people.  They are employed by WRA, which is in a transition process on a confidential matter.  Please remove them.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Looks fine with me. 
 Twanda, please handle.  MHC 
 I've sent this to litigation unit.  MHC 
 Cathy,  I have been getting this question a lot!  It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or something to that effect.  Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really should follow through.  Michelle 
 I believe that these involve issues of intellectual property and thus are more appropriately decided by you.  In principle, I have no issue with Enron indemnifying Accenture for intellectual property litigation relating to content ownership.  On the logo issue, I would have to defer to you and the PR/branding folks.  Michelle 
 who knows.  I can't imagine that a customer would somehow owe insurance to the provider's employees.  Michelle 
 so, would we have an issue? 
 Thanks for the resume.  This person's background won't work for us -- we need more transactional work experience for them to be successful here, particularly M&A, major real estate, financing, etc.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Please arrange as many of these as you can.  Michelle 
 this looks fine with me.  Michelle 
 Please save as a MHC document -- I think that some of this will be used for powerpoint for Nepco trip next week.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Mike,  Would you please provide me information on which attorney is handling the NEPCO charge?  I would like to obtain information from him and be "in the loop" on all legal matters involving NEPCO's employment practices issues.  Thanks a lot.  I am looking forward to visiting with you in person next week.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please print this for me - -I've been having problems when I try to print.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, what do you think of this?  I view it as problemmatic because I believe the grant agreements and the stock plan should govern.  Your comments and suggested revisions would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Sharon, I suggest that we ask Valeria Hope to investigate the fact situation here and report back to us jointly.  What do you think?  Michelle 
 sounds great!  I've asked Twanda to set something up.  MHC 
 Valeria is looking into it.  Michelle 
 FYI -- He tried to call me today, but missed me.  I have returned his call and left a voice mail for him.  I'll let you know if we have a chance to visit.  Michelle 
 Thanks, but we got it from the vault late yesterday.  Michelle 
 Thanks.  I'll do an assignment letter formalizing the relationship.  Michelle 
 FYI, it looks like you are on the way to approval.  Until that time, if you have any excess capacity in terms of time, get with Valeria on HR Employee Relations efforts.  Thanks.  MHC 
 These changes look fine to me for employees working in Japan.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI, these should be in our form files for Japan -- this is the new Form B for Japan.  Michelle 
 Shanna, Botchlett is not interested in mediating at this time.  He wants to go for the jugular, I guess.  MHC 
 Hi, all.  On the budget for HR Risk Management (formerly OLER), Cindy told me to keep things flat for next year.  I would appreciate seeing the numbers for budget projections and actuals for the group year to date, though.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dan, Wayne Perry has issues with the consulting agreement I drafted for him and wants to use a form that you drafted some time in the past.  Do you want to pick it up?  By copy of this, I am asking Twanda to send you a copy of the agreement we submitted for him.  Michelle 
 I'll be there!  Do we have a meeting with Shankman for tomorrow? 
 Teresa,  The employment lawyer at Littler, Mendelson is named Kerry Notestine.  He is in the loop on this and has copies of the relevant agreements.  I also will have emailed him my summary of the Bob Henderson agreement, so he is up to speed on where we are going from the employment arena.  His number, in case you need an immediate response while I am at NEPCO next week, is 713-652-4748.  Michelle 
 yes, we still own the IP. 
 Hi, David!  I look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.  I wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in Houston.  Specifically, an employee named Jason Davis claims that he was fired from  his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there.  OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an investigation.  Have you heard of this?  How would you like to handle it?  We can discuss in more detail on Thursday.  Michelle 
 Pat, would you please give this a look and provide comments?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Diane, would you please send Valeria the recent (positive) article on PRC?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, I think this isolates the employment-related comments for the Brooklyn Navy Yard transaction.  Your comments would be appreciated.  Thanks.  MHC 
 I don't know if you heard, but Kim and I spoke with him, and he is ok with everything.  I guess you can consider this one closed, except that I would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to Kim and me for review and placement in the file.  Thanks! 
 sounds good to me. 
 Cameron sleeps in a real bed, but would be happy on the floor as well.  No more cribs, yea!!  Great news about the tix.  We easily can have Cam sit on our laps, so no need to get any great seats -- if we can buy bleacher tickets to get him in the door, that works for us.  We are so excited!! 
 will do 
 No, I know about that one and agree with you that it is critical!  I just wanted to know when we were meeting with Shankman. 
 I'd like to have access, but I don't have access to "O" drive.  Can that be rectified, or is that beyond your role? 
 Sarah,  At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.  Mary Joyce, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements.  Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from Mary first.  Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective.  Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement. 
 I have not.  I'll send a follow-up email today. 
 Absolutely!  I agree that it would be great for you. 
 I know we had some sensitivity in the past; let me check on it and get back with you.  mhc 
 Rick, I believe that this probably is a duplication of efforts -- almost everyone has emailed me with that information already, pursuant to my prior request.  I'll forward those to you for your information.  I would like to institute some limitations on training for the group, due to costs and out-of-office considerations, but I have not finalized those recommendations yet.  Stay tuned!  MHC 
 Pat, I am keeping you busy these days.  Any comments on below?  Michelle 
 Neither did I.  I just got the comments yesterday.  I'll review the issues on the plane today and provide comments.  Michelle 
 I'm handling the afternoon -- I think that Harry has this morning.  MHC 
 I got this.  I assume this is 12:30 Central Time? 
 Here is the overview of Bob Henderson's Employment Agreement. 
 What do you think?  MHC 
 Please send David Lund copies of our standard corporate services agreement and the standard assignment letter (use Bridgeline example -- with and without non-compete).  Michelle 
 We're formatting one this week, and we'll send it when it's done.  Michelle 
 I agree also, but I don't know all the parties or complications involved.  Should there be a (groan) meeting on this? 
 Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Shanna, I spoke with Per tonight about this.  Let's talk tomorrow.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Let's discuss exactly what is involved here -- confidentiality, etc.  Thanks.  MHC 
 please print all these for me.  Thanks.  MHC 
 FYI re:  NEPCO picketing issues.  Michelle 
 generally, we just go by the terms in the agreement and attach a brief position description. 
 I assume this has been calendared? 
 Let's meet with her and anyone else she would like to have attend.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Mark, I understand that this is a copy of the latest agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting.  I agree that a new master would be a good idea.  Michelle 
 Misha, I haven't yet received the details about the lunch on the 28th.  I'm out on vacation the end of next week, so I wanted to try to fill it early next week.  Could you forward me the invitation or details?  Thanks.  MHC 
 Thanks, Misha.  How many are at a table?  I've already got some folks who are interested.  Michelle 
 In my dealings with Accenture, they have acted as if this is the agreement that governs them.  I don't know which Accenture group is involved, however.  Either way, I believe that it is time for an updated agreement, with better rates.  Have you been working with Global Strategic Sourcing on this? 
 I'll get it set up.  Michelle 
 Indeed I will.  MHC 
 David,  Derrick approved the use of Charlie Caulkin.  Also, here is info on the Denver lawyer who should review the issues relating to the sharing of employees.  Do you want to call him, or would you like me to?  Good to see you this week.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  NEPCO picketing issues. 
 Frank,  I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week.  During our meeting, you indicated that you were going to put together a draft of the response to the OSHA charge and circulate a draft on Wednesday.  I haven't seen a draft, and I understand that the response deadline is today.  Perhaps you were able to obtain an extension, but I hadn't heard of that if you were.  Would you please let me know the status?  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Twanda is out today and Monday; I'll do the best I can. 
 Please save these to a MHC document -- I've got edits.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Dear Grandmother,  So sorry we didn't make it  yesterday.  We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart  -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind.  Oops!!!  He had to have a special kind of bandage, but it doesn't hurt him any more, so I think all is going to be ok.  So, I apologize for not making it yesterday.  Hope all is well with you. 
 Ryan, I think we should have some draft answers for these -- get with the MAD team to see what kinds of answers we have given in the past on these types of questions.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks for  the good words.  I appreciate your input.  Michelle 
 Valeria,  FYI -- here are kudos from one of your clients!  Keep up the good work!  Michelle 
 Not that I know of.  Michelle 
 I don't know.  I would suggest that you ask Cynthia Barrow for starters.  Sorry I am so clueless.  MHC 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 please make changes. 
 Diane, there are lots of emails about this topic.  Would you please print them and collect them in a file labelled for Tobias?  Thanks.  MHC 
 I don't know -- I think we've categorized them as severance, but maybe we should get with Mackin.  MHC 
 Diane, I've left a message for Brian Bloom about this -- would you please follow up, as he either didn't get my message or has not returned my call.  Basically, we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners, and now we want to dissolve it.  Would you ask him to provide a brief overview via email as to what it would entail?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Donna, I think this falls in your court.  Let me know if it should be handled elsewhere.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 please calendar -- I'd like to go. =20 
 Let's discuss when we both can talk.  MHC 
 Here is the first part of Kerry's email.  MHC 
 Rick, would you mind getting on the transition of HRRM functions to the staffing and service center groups?  I think that you have the most familiarity with the processes and perhaps could facilitate that taking place next week.  Let's discuss.  Michelle 
 The contents of this email are privileged and confidential.  Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.  IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to "salt" jobs down there in Florida.  The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.  Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.  We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.  There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.  Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who will control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.  Back to Mark's suggestions:  Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.  E.g., "Are you hiring electricians out there?"  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.  Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.  Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.  One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.  David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally. 
 I've received advice from Vinson & Elkins on this, which I will send your way.  It looks like we can.  MHC 
 Pat, do you have any insight as to the question below?  Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.  Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.  Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months.  Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity.  The assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of Newco.  How does that impact the question below?  Thanks!  Michelle 
 You are invited to sit at the Enron table for the Father of the Year luncheon on August 28 at 11:45 at the Hyatt Regency.   This event is a delightful one, where there are tributes paid to several "outstanding" fathers in the community.  Please let me know if you would be able to attend. 
 Pat, I hope you are feeling well.  Kidney stones sound painful!!  Take care of yourself.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please pull all emails on this subject matter out of my in box and print for the file.  Thanks.  MHC 
 No.  I believe that the answer will be to destroy the materials, but I am double-checking the research on that this afternoon.  Thanks.  MHC 
 April 20 
 FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about Southern Company.  It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.  The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims.  The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards.  I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves.  I would like to talk about how to manage that.  Let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting, and I'll set something up.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 So, my question goes to the highest bidder . . . 
 Please note that we do not agree with the terms of the letter attached to the resume.  We have provided a contract for review by your company, and that agreement should govern.  With that, thanks for the resume.  Michelle Cash 
 Of course -- I was just giving you grief! 
 hard to offend me 
 please print these for me.  Thanks.  mhc 
 Thanks!! 
 FYI.  I've left him a message that it is "no problem" in this instance.  But, I know that you were interested in having it reviewed before it went out, so I wanted to let you know what was happening.  MHC 
 Today, I received a demand from Art Bieser's attorney.  He basically wants a year's pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible).  I have given Fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand.  Let me know if you want to know the details.  I suggest that Fran and I get together Monday with a proposed response, which we will run by you before responding to the demand.  In any event, Art will not be returning to the office at all.  Michelle 
 I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.  We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.  In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.  Michelle 
 Amy, at your convenience, please give me a call about Walter Coffer's review.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Michelle Cash Assistant General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department 713-853-6401 Ass't:  Twanda Sweet -- 713-853-9402 
 Tara,  Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.  Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.  So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.  Call me with any questions.  Michelle 
 What do you mean by backdating?  I think our policy has been to make those current or close to current at the time of signing. 
 Valeria.  Thanks for handling this one.  Please keekp me posted.  Michelle 
 John, how do you want to handle this?  Michelle 
 please print these and file -- AMPS.  Thanks. MHC

 Hi, Felicia.  As I told Cindy, there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts I have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units.  I simply don't organize my documents that way.  Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.  As of now, I have over 4500 documents on that list.  So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.  I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.  The others most likely were at VP or above level, so I think they have been captured by corporate comp.  I hope that gives you information, even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for.  Let me know if you have questions.  Michelle  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Michelle Cash Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3823 Houston, Texas  77002 (713) 853-6401 michelle.cash@enron.com  This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges. 
 Gina/David, I think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions.  My view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation.  Presumably, if they have a Click at Home PC, they can do it from there.  If not, we should be able to facilitate it manually.

 Rick,  Nice kudos from Robert.  Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this.  As you may recall, she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the generalists.  They now are calling her for help, so her knowing what you are doing is essential.  Thanks.  Michelle

 Hi, Janel,  I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.  In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.  Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.  I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.  She can either assist you or find someone else who can.  Thanks.

 Diane, would you please track this down and let Cathy know that we'll respond asap when I return.  Or, you could have Kriste respond.

 Kerry,  We drove by your house, which looked like it took on some water.  I hope all is ok, and that you didn't have too  much damage.  Bellaire was hit pretty hard.  On another note, if you are able to gather any more info on this Midwest Generation issue, would you please call Jeff Hodge in our legal department?  Twanda can connect you.

 Bummer about the flood insurance.  Of course, we had it and didn't need it.  We also pulled up our rugs, moved furniture, etc.  Had we not, the house surely would have flooded.

 Yes, I should be involved.  Have you sent Noel prior information? 
 FYI, I forgot to forward this to you earlier.  MHC 
 That is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If so, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.  We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.  Michelle 
 Would you please send Rob Cole here at Enron a copy of our letter to EEOC for April?  He doesn't need any of the attachments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please print?  Thanks.  MHC 
 for my forms files.  thanks. mhc 
 Why does this person need Expertfinder?  I didn't get a specific reason from prior emails.  If he needs to locate people, shouldn't Peoplefinder do it for him?  More information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Would you please send Janice Priddy the blank short form?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, will you please handle this?  Add the inserts for the various items.  Michelle 
 I think we should call it a project bonus, not an incentive bonus, because our annual bonus plan is called the Annual Incentive Plan.  Also, we usually use some other language.  I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention letter.  Michelle 
 No, it should remain the top 25 percent, because it is the top percentage of the criteria, not the peer group.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Do you know this person? 
 please print this plus attachment and file under Corporate American Express Cards.  thanks 
 please send her our standard confidentiality agreement that we attach to the consulting services agreement -- ok to send it by email. thanks 
 Mark,  Attached is a signed version of the Consulting Services Agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).  Yevgeny Frolov in HR is working on a project whereby Accenture is developing software for Enron.  Enron will own the content of the programs, and ultimately, licenses will be sold for the software, with Enron and Accenture sharing the royalty interest.  I think that your expertise is needed on this agreement.  I will send you a copy of the latest term letter, along with my handwritten comments on the draft.  Would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these?  Yevgeny will contact you directly.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pursuant to my prior email, here is the draft term letter.  I will forward my handwritten comments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Ava, would you please forward this to the IP lawyer who is handling Mark's stuff while he's out?  Thanks.  MHC 
 Ava, would you please forward this to the IP lawyer who is handling Mark's work?  We are looking for a quick turnaround, so if you could ask him to call me asap, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks for the info, Karen.  Go ahead and keep this in your file regarding Meliza, so that it can be there in the event we need it further.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please note.  MHC 
 Will do, once I receive the revised agreement from them.  Michelle 
 I spoke with her and got this information.  We are scheduling her to come in and meet with Mark Taylor, Cheryl Nelson, and others who have information about the position.  Molly, when is that interview scheduled?  Michelle 
 why don't we wait and share our revised policies with them? 
 Please print this plus attachment and file Corporate American Express Cards.  thanks 
 Alan, do you want to talk with this guy while he's in town?  Michelle 
 Would you please find a copy of this and send to Felicia?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I think this is in your ballpark, not mine! 
 I am happy to assist, although I think that this is Kriste's world.  I've passed this email on to her, and will assume that she has it covered, unless I hear otherwise.  Michelle 
 Thanks, Pat.  It is only temporary (at least, that's what I keep insisting!).  I just learned about a new deal involving coal mines in Wyoming or Montana (I can't remember now).  Data room to be opened in Denver on Monday.  I'll send you details asap and let you know if we may need to invite you along.  Would you be available?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Looks good to me. 
 Who will get them?  I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversation and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect the privilege.  Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is no protection if we find undesirable results. 
 Hello, all.  Attached is an invitation from Seyfarth Shaw to attend their labor and employment seminar.  It is scheduled for Tuesday, 7/17, and lasts only a half-day.  Generally, their seminars are high quality.  Plus, the cost is only $50.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  Michelle 
 I don't think that is a good idea. 
 I like that better.  When is that meeting?  Or, do we want to do that separately outside of the PRC evaluation meeting? 
 please print this and file Corporate American Express Cards. Thanks. 
 I'd check with Oxley first.  I kind of think they are separate issues, and I am not sure that the whole group needs to see the areas where we may have issues.  MHC 
 absolutely, unless Kerry plans to be nice to him 
 I can't attend, as I'll be out of the office in Austin at a mediation.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please send them hard copies of the invitation for Seyfarth's seminar.  Thanks.  MHC 
  How are we answering this type of question? 
 Oops -- too efficient. 
 please put in Curran's files. 
 I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.  Does that matter? 
 yes, it is redundant. 
 No, but we have been meeting on this topic.  We met early this week and are having a follow-up meeting next week.  I will ask Diane Goode to include you by phone, if you want to attend.  Michelle 
 We're meeting now, near my office -- can you come? 
 They are done and should be in your email today.  MHC 
 Congratulations!!!!  I know you are happy to have that wrapped up.  Michelle 
 great -- let me know your feedback. 
 Also, say hi to Ted Meyer, who is my (and your) Bellaire neighbor. 
 I think this works.  What is the best way to incorporate this into the plan? 
 I'm holding off on these until I get the package from PR. 
 My info is correct.  Michelle 
 yes, indeed.. 
 What do you think?  We have a babysitter that night already, although I am sure we could cancel it. 
 Please schedule me to attend this meeting.  Thanks.  MHC 
 George,  I spoke with Fran about the Leaf River contracts.  She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from Eric Connor.  Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment.  I understand that Fran has asked Eric for this data.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Michelle 
 Terrie, On the issue of communicating the restated severance plan, below is the recommendation of four different attorneys who have considered the issue.  Michelle 
 No rush on this -- late this week is fine.  Michelle 
 Would you please handle this?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I'll get back with you asap.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  offer revocation.  Michelle 
 Money. 
 The good news is, we don't owe a mediation fee, right?  Lizzette, I'll give Jack a call.  Michelle 
 I guess I would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like.  Hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing.  Michelle 
 I will provide more detailed comments later, but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all Enron entities domestically.  Similarly, some Enron-owned companies have adopted their own vacation, sick pay, etc.  So, we should be careful about the audience for these communications.  I suggest getting with Rick Johnson on that issue.  Michelle 
 Ann, I've looked over this list and realized I have no relevant information, so I've forwarded it to Sharon and Kriste, who should be able to help you.  Sorry I can't do it myself, but I just don't know anything about the pipes.  Michelle 
 Mike,  I have reviewed the NEPCO AGreement to separation pay and release of claims.  I believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not comply with the requirements of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.  I will send you a new waiver form to use.    The one you are using is not valid under the ADEA.  Michelle 
 I agree that it is best to leave alone. 
 Yes. Send to me. Thanks. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 I don't think we should curtail cause terminations.  Others would probably be best to wait unless there is a disruptive situation.  Michelle 
 You should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  We do have a plan in place, but we haven't terminated any employees under that plan  in the last few weeks.  So, we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now.  Michelle 
 We need the following data asap:  1.  Number of total employees at all Enron entities broken down by domestic and US 2.  Breakdown of those domestic employees by whether they are hourly or salaried 3.  Amount of accrued, unpaid vacation balance.  Michelle

 I have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.  They want the following asap:  Signed copies of contracts for Greg Whalley and Vince Kaminsky (who may not have a contract) Sample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily Signed sample agreement for an IT person, such as Jay Webb (I think I can get this one as well).  They also want the following data for the 838:  Name Position/title 2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc) Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc.  (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number) If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract Did the person get a stay bonus last week?  If so, amount. Date of hire If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.  They are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 please file "Pam Benson".  Thanks.  MHC 
 please file in Diomedes' file.  Thanks.  MHC 
 fine with me.  mhc 
 You need more than the 840 for this -- you also need the IT personnel.  I'll forward those to Kathy so she can get started.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 No risk to non-compete.  The payment obligation is one that is independent of non-compete.  MHC 
 Here is the second list.  Michelle 
 I got this request a second time.  Probably Fran would have the best knowledge of exactly how these people were paid. 
 Alan,  I got a request from Carey Sloan that we confirm in writing that he was no longer an officer or board member of any Enron entity as of the last date of his employment.  Can we do that?  If so, who can assist?  Thanks.  Michelle

 I agree. But we should pay them the 4500. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 We have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer would not be taking them.  However, we have a data room list that specifies what was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room.  We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.  Let me know if you have questions.  Which deal are you actively working on?  Fire or Wind?  Do I need to be working on the draft agreement?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are my comments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Go ahead and let them stay until vesting.  Please reverse their terminations and see if there is any work they can do until the termination day.  If they got the $4500, offset that amount from pay.  Michelle 
 We will need to look at our vacation pay practice with Weil to determine whether we can pay out in the future for accrued, but unused vacation. I think we can say that they'll get no less than $4500, but we want to confirm with Weil. Don't know about parking/bus.  I think it is regular course, but we may have to change that regular course. 
 I agree -- involve Valeria.  You also should invite my new lawyer, Lizzette Palmer.  Twanda is her assistant, also.  Thanks.  Michelle

 Good morning.  David has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.  We will need those segregated as follows:  Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks. Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations. EEL employees Employees remaining in the Enron estate.  Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.  Thanks!!  Michelle 
 Maureen, as soon as I receive anything, I'll forward it on.  I am working on it and have been since yesterday.  Michelle

 Don't give SSNs.  I'd suggest giving names only. 
 Are we agreeing to this? 
 Given that this has not been communciated to current employees, I believe that we should consider whether we want to continue this strategy at this time.  It strikes me as something that should be discussed at the management committee level, as that was the group that made this decision last summer.  Michelle 
 I'd transfer to ENA effective 1/1.  If the people have employment agreements, we will need to assign.  Michelle 
 How does he want to change it?  If it is more generous, then I think we should discuss.  Michelle

 lizzette has taken the lead on this immigration issue.  thanks.  michelle 
 no, it looked suspicious, so I didn't open it.  Fax is 713-646-3490. 
 Diane/Lizzette --  I would say that the background check issue is a business call.  They are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks.  Same with the guarantee language.  If there is a change, however, I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement.  That way, we won't have to live with it for every placement.  Michelle 
 Yes, do a wire.  Her check to IRS will bounce if we don't handle it today.  Thanks.  Michelle

 in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation. We haven't made that decision here though.

 who is handling reinstatement for ENA? 
 David,  I think we should remove anything relating to the components of a retention -- i.e., whether it is RS or cash -- and any thing relating to vesting.  No way to predict at this time.  As I have more comments, I'll send them on.  Mich 
 One other thing -- Texas law will apply to those employees in Texas, as state courts will not allow other laws to govern in employee matters.  Oregon is the same.  As I re-read, I found more references to vesting or payout dates.  Again, these should be more generic or blank.  Michelle 
 Unfortunately, no.  We have to get those approved by creditors here first.  Bummer.  Michelle  Merry Christmas!

 what will the success fee look like?  Michelle 
 I have looked at the policy and have no major issue with it, except to the extent that it may be either duplicative or different from policies that Corp. is looking to implement.  I agree with Paul's approach on the practice aspect as well as the statement that management will take reasonable steps to look for their unaccounted-for personnel.  Paul, it might make sense for you to talk with Robert Jones and David Oxley, who are looking at overall security issues in the wake of the terrorist attacks.  Michelle 
 I think it would be best to get those terms in this agreement. 
 FYI, in case you don't already have this.  Michelle 
 Hello, John.  I am forwarding this to you at the request of Rob Walls.  Let me know if you also would like to have the litigation summary for employment matters.  Michelle 
 done -- do you also want me to send him the list of litigation? 
 I think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.  I agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit.  If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term.  If the situation arises, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.  Michelle 
 perfect!  I hope that we can make it!!  Michelle 
 Did you have a chance to respond? 
 please do an assignment.  Michelle 
 Thanks for the thoughts.  We are getting through it.  Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!  Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get Trey to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD Anderson Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  Joan Lunden MC'd.  The Houston Symphony provided music.  Video from George W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, Lyle Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the Houston Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and Barbara, James Baker, Alan Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.  Well, I'd better get back to it.  Michelle 
 I have seen this, but I don't think it should go out.  David/Mary/Cindy, please correct me if I'm wrong.  Michelle 
 The OSHA complaint was dismissed. Michelle 
 would you please handle?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Neil, why not put them under an agreement? That would cover all of these aspects, as well as info re:  fees, etc.  Michelle 
 sounds good -- I'll send you a standard confidentiality agreement, which also contains a non-solicitation of employees.  Michelle  Twanda, would you please do a standard confidentiality agreement for this company for my review? Thanks.  Michelle 
 wouldn't you want them not to solicit the employees they meet when they talk with you and your team? 
 do you want  me to allow them to solicit you?  Just say the word. 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 Let's get with Tommy to expedite it, if you want.  L, M 
 who says they would want him? 
 Any officer can sign for Enron -- generally speaking, we like to have the BU head sign.  Michelle 
 I don't think that this is a good idea for her process or any other general process. 
 Jon is the perfect choice if he is an officer of that entity.  Michelle 
 Sure, we could set up an LLC entity to employ those people.  They would have issues around payroll and benefits, but those can be handled.  Michelle 
 We need to talk about that meeting with me, Mike, and John.  I do not think it went well at all, but I would like to discuss it with you.  Michelle 
 great -- thanks! 
 please calendar.  Thanks. Michelle 
 What a delightful and welcome change of pace in my email today!  Definitely count us in.  We'd love to join you.  By the way, do you have Mata Kroger's new phone number?  Or, is she still with Comsys?  Thanks!  Michelle 
 please draft.  thanks.  Michelle 
 Go ahead and ask her to have the attorney call me.  Michelle 
 Sheila,  Could you please provide me with PH files and also complete the charts on the following people?  Some of them may have left the company, and others may never have been employed.  Will you have access to all current/former employees' information?  If not, who would?  Thanks tons!!  Michelle 
 It might help if I gave you the names!  Amy Flores Michael Hinds Chris Loehr Michelle Stroud Joyce Tang Ben Thomason Rudy de la Paz Frank Felicia  Thanks! 
 please get with him.  Michelle 
 Jo Ann,  Can you provide the answers for me?  Then I can decide how to proceed with Arthur.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 John and Louise						,  I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.  I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus.  I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks.  A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp.  I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues.  Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.  Let me know if you would like any more information.  You can reach me at 3-6401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.  Michelle 
 For your information -- Here is some severance language I received from Lit= tler.  Michelle 
 Not needed -- we have Ogletree on it.  Michelle 
 We need to do assignments for these folks.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Good day, Diomedes,  First, let me say that I am sorry about the delay in responding to your earlier email.  I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments has begun!  Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the processing.  However, if you have questions about timing, please feel free to call me at  713-853-6401 or Pam Butler at 713-853-6161.  Feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this matter further.  Michelle 
 I do not have any of this information -- Cathy, is the Metals plan the same as Enron domestic?  If so, then I would suggest that Chris Rahaim participate in this process.  Feel free to work with me on it, but I just don't have any data.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I am not aware of any. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I am happy for us to paper the deal.  I am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for Scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets -- it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset.  Michelle 
 We have confirmed the amounts of the contracts.  When I speak of processing, it relates to the processing of the checks/wire transfers. 
 Thanks, Lynn, for the update.  If they have no interest in putting a settlement offer out there, then I suggest that we schedule the plaintiff's deposition.  Let's turn up the heat.  Michelle 
 Vicki,  As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by Michael Lindert against Enron Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 million.  Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.  I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me).  The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.  The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to federal court.  Let me know how you want me to proceed.  Michelle 
 Twanda, could you please detach this attachment and send it to the following email address from my email?  I just don't want all the other communications enclosed.  We need to cc:  Julia Murray.  kevin.r.kosub@us.andersen.com.  Thanks!  Michelle 
 David,  I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.    For your information, David, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.  It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.  Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.  I'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.  Michelle 
 This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?  I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type language here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys. 
 Leslie,  I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. Nicholas arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.  Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop.  Would it be possible for us to arrive late?  I'd hate to create a disturbance, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.  Thanks!  Michelle 
 please print and put in diomedes christodolou file. thanks 
 please print and file in diomedes christodolou's file. thanks. mhc 
 Pam,  I guess a separate line of inquiry is whether we owe him payments under his employment contract.  We probably should get with Castleman this week.  Michelle 
 please print and file in diomedes christodolou file.  thanks.  mhc 
 Aaron, does this apply to companies in which we have a large ownership interest, but that may not be a "subsidiary"?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Jo Ann, what is the answer?  Michelle 
 FYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of Thanksgiving last year.  He gave me some scoop on the trip.  The weather is nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.  Lots of good food.  One thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.  You may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid).  Later, Michelle 
 Who would see or use this? 
 Add to your question list.  Michelle 
 I'll be out also -- on the cruise, baby!!!! 
 Your thoughts? 
 We are planning to attend, although I am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm. I have got to get out there, as you can appreciate!!  But I hope to see you at Kari's house.

 Carol. I spoke with lara robinson this morning. She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made. She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released. Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees. Seems unusual to me. Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience. My number is 713-218-7155. Thanks. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 doesn't this sound divine. . . 
 Attached is a proposed letter to use when rescinding an offer of employment.  I have consolidated drafts done by Fran Mayes and Terry Bosien.  If you have other forms that you think work better, please send them our way. I think it will be useful to work from the same document across Enron.  Please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others in similar circumstances, and that special care should be taken for those who have quit prior jobs, relocated, or are in precarious visa situations.  Michelle 
 The minimum number of days should be 21, and they should have 7 days to revoke it.  Although the ADEA probably would not apply to A&A candidates, it could be an issue for the rest of the organization.  Michelle

  Hi, Janette and Diane,  Based on my conversations with Mark, we are going to revise this letter a bit.  So, hold off on giving them to him until the next round!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 The intent is not to include 16b officers.  Payments will not be made if termination occurs prior to payment date.  I'll get back with you on the other issues.  Michelle

  As we discussed, here is the second set of Q&As.   Your comments would be appreciated.  Michelle 
 FYI -- I guess we'll all be busy.  Michelle 
 Thanks!  I needed a little levity.  Michelle 
  FYI 
 In case you didn't get this.  Michelle 
 Although this is EWS floor meeting, you may want to come to hear the messag= es being delivered.  MHC 
 Here are the details.  Michelle 
 David,  Just a question as to whether Dynegy has been notified that we are amending the contracts of these guys to delete minimum or target bonus and replacing with performance bonus memo?  We may want to send a brief email confirming the discussions and their consent so that we have it for our files.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.  Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.  I agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.  Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.  Ya'll let me know if you disagree. 
 Has this been approved by David Oxley?  If not, we can't proceed.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 The meeting with Mark Haedicke has been scheduled for 2:00 tomorrow.  Kerry, I suggest that you arrive by 1:45, as our security has increased significantly.  By copy of this email, I am asking Twanda to call the security console to alert them of your arrival.  Please ask for me when you arrive -- extension 36401.  We'll meet with Mark and then meet with David Oxley, who runs HR for the company, to discuss your role while I am out and beyond.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Hi Dawn,  I am working on a project that requires the review of employment contracts.  I do not have signed copies of several Enron Canada agreements.  Would you mind faxing them down to me via Twanda as soon as possible on Friday?  We are on a Lavo deadline.   Thanks.  The people are:  Chad Clark, Mike Cowan, Paul Devries, Eric LeDain, Chris Dorland, John McKay, and John Zufferli (only if he signed the one we did for Enron Canada for him-- I have the ENA one dated 12/24/99).  I appreciate your assistance.  Please call Twanda before the fax arrives, as it is a central legal department fax and not a private one.  Thanks a lot!!  Michelle 
 Twanda, how can we get these?  Can we enlist Knudsen's help?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Based on my review of the files, we do not have signed agreements for the following:  Tom Alonso* Mark Fischer* Ben Jacoby Laura Luce Mike McDonald Narsimha Misra Dave Parquet Gregg Penman Frank Vickers Andy Zipper  Would you mind asking the vault if they have these?  If not, could you get with Knudsen to get them?  Thanks.  (By the way, no one should know why).  Thanks a lot!!  Michelle 
 Eric,  As mentioned in my voice mail, Pat McCarthy is the attorney we use for GSP employment matters.  I believe that he may be better suited to answer your questions (and may have the time while I am out on vacation next week).   His number is 973-966-8117.   I have left him a voice mail telling him that you may give him a call, so he will be prepared.  I hope that is helpful.  Michelle 
 Absolutely, I agree with that.  Michelle 
 I like the message and agree that communication is critical at this time.  Should we go right out and say that no one will be affected next week (more artfully phrased of course)?  I believe that is the right way to go (no terminations Thanksgiving week), so I'd like to go ahead and say it.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 I have retained Kerry Notestine from Littler Mendelson to help me on this project, so we don't need to get Bob Vote involved. 
 yes, that would be great. Michelle 
 Cole, here are the revisions to the benefit plan q&a doc.  I think these are ready to go if these comments are incorporated -- but check with Barrow on them.  On your question about being able to put some of them on the web, let's go through which ones can go and which ones need to be further reviewed.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I agree, unless some of them have moved from EEL to ENA or vice versa.  In that situation, we definitely want to know about it so that the docs can be assigned.  Michelle 
 Pat, please let me know if my email of last night did not go through.  I am in the office now 713-853-6401.  Thanks!!  Michelle 
 FYI, Sharon will handle maintaining the list of all persons who are critical witnesses in future litigation so that we can take that into consideration when managing personnel decisions.  Michelle 
 FYI -- I've been reviewing most of the Q&As on the questions raised post merger announcement.  I don't think you need to do much, but I wanted you to be aware that this was going on.  Michelle 
 Lizzette and Ryan,  Kriste and I substantially revised the waiver agreement today, so sit tight= .  Kriste, do you want to add the mediation provision?  I'll leave that to you= .  Michelle 
 FYI.  Let us know if these folks are appropriate to include on our "critical for litigation" list.  Thanks!  Michelle 
 Thanks a lot for managing this! 
 This will just be Rome and Enron.  Although we believe that most of his claims really are against HMS, his lawyer is claiming that Enron used HMS to defraud Rome.  His lawsuit will be against only Enron.  Therefore, it makes no sense to drag HMS into this at this point (although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed). 
 Valeria,  I agree that we need her to execute that note by a date certain.  This has gone on too long.  Michelle 
 Lance,  Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!  I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.  Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.  Michelle 
 I think this looks good.  For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to populate.  One other field to add would be visa status.  As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column.  Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at the direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, I really like that approach.  Looks great to me!  Michelle 
 Kriste, did you get this?  If not, I think it really works!!  Michelle 
 Pat, I am not sure if your email to Kriste went through -- I've forwarded it to her.  BUt, FYI, her address is kriste.sullivan@enron.com.  Thanks for all your help! 
 Kriste,  I believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete.  The only one in question is for Brian Redmond, whose contract we did not have.  Jeanie is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to Twanda.  Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to Kriste for finalizing.  Then (I hope) we'll be done!!!!  Thanks.  Michelle  PS, the number to the grammar hotline is 713-221-8670. 
 Stewart called me last week for some advice.  I had to leave a message for him when I called him back.  So, I gave him your names as backup in case he needs immediate assistance.  Just wanted you to know that he might be calling one of you.  Michelle 
 David,  Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.  In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.  Let me know your thoughts on this.  Michelle 
 Here is a proposed communication regarding severance plan changes.  This proposal makes me most nervous.  My recommendation would be to let everyone know it has been restated and attach an electronic copy of the new plan, thus letting the plan speak for itself.  We then could arm HR with a list of FAQs to address the changes without publishing anything other than the plan to the population as a whole.  What do you think?  Also, Kriste, we will have to determine the audience for severance plan communication, as not all Enron entities have this plan (e.g., NEPCO).  Same thing with vacation.  Michelle 
 I am a bit unclear.  Are these ready for my final review yet?  If so, I will get right on them.  Michelle 
 Thanks, I agree.  Michelle 
 Karen, is this now ready for my review? 
 This is great!  Thanks for the info.  Michelle 
 This is fine, but is it harsh enough? 
 I got a call from Rome's lawyer, who wants to call the whole thing off because he doesn't think he'll get the money he wants.  I told him we were ready and willing to proceed.  He was going to call the mediator to see if he could cancel without incurring the mediation fees.  So, I'll keep you posted.  Michelle 
 I am not sure I understand the question.  Give me a call when you have a chance.  Michelle 
 My recommendation would be that we don't comment at all, but let the terms of the Plan and the related waivers speak for themselves.  We cannot provide them with legal advice.  Michelle 
 Fyi -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I don't think that is true.  Our waiver does contemplate such a release of claims.  I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms of our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves. 
 I agree. 
 I'd like a copy of that, if possible.  I think it should state:  Confidential and Proprietary -- Not to be Disclosed to Persons Other Than Human Resources and Legal Department.  If possible, put it on all documents, as well as the cover of the notebook.  Michelle 
 Go ahead and pose the question, but the answer should be that we don't comment at all on litigation, and that the terms of severance plan and related waivers will govern the situation.  We should reiterate that we can't provide with legal advice.  Michelle 
 What is he asking? 
 It is in the Q&As already posted.  We cannot comment on HR policies/plans f= or Dynegy or for the merged entity because we simply don't know.  Michelle 
 Simone, how do I get to LiveLink again? 
 I think that ya'll have handled the legal work for these entities in the past.  Can you provide Ann with this information asap?  Thanks!  Michelle 
 Claudia, would you please arrange to have these collected?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I have reviewed the contract for Brent.  He has a 3-month non-compete after the termination of his employment.  Is he planning to honor it?  If not, we have to make decisions about pursuing him in court.  Michelle 
 Great idea to put this out there.  FYI, I have arranged for Jack Wisdom to provide some training on wage and hour law issues in the next few weeks.  I'll keep you posted on the status of that.  Michelle 
 Under the Enron Corp. severance plan, can we provide employees with the opportunity to take voluntary termination in lieu of future involuntary term?  One of our offices wants to offer employees that opportunity, with some sort of enhanced benefit if they take it.  Your quick thoughts on this would be appreciated.  Michelle 
 As a follow up to the discussion today, this may be of assistance.  Michell= e 
 We are working on this issue this week by meeting with Joe Dilg and putting forth a summary memo of the history of the situation, the pay requirements under the contract, and recommendations of how to move forward.  That will be done this week, and everyone on this email will be copied on it.  Michelle 
 I know, but that doesn't change the fact that we should articulate the standards that we are using -- I know that they use some criteria that are based on solid business reasons, so let's capture them!  That way, we at least can explain why we did things.  Michelle 
 who are they?

 Happy to talk with you about the ADA -- I've actually written two papers on the topic and edited an article in The Houston Lawyer on your very topic (albeit several years ago, which was before the Supremes spoke on the issue).  On the Senior Specialist position, I am happy to discuss that with you as well.  Please get with my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 39402 to schedule a time next week to talk.  Michelle 
 this guy is going to call to schedule -- give him 30 minutes.  mhc 
 Yes, it has.  In fact, I gave the same message as you describe below.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 The 2 weeks is the amount of years of service,  or the amount of 10K increments in salary.  The 4 weeks is a premium on top of that amount. 
 That's the plan, stan. 
 Thanks for getting me this info.  Michelle 
 Linda,  I can't make 10 tomorrow, so go ahead and meet without me.  Lunch this week would be difficult, as I'm out Thursday and Friday attending the SW Legal Foundation Labor seminar in Dallas.  Would you like to try something next week with me and Lizzette Palmer, my new attorney?  If so, have your assistant get with Twanda at 853-9402 to schedule, as Twanda works for both me and Lizzette.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 when is this scheduled? 
 please calendar.  thanks 
 I haven't specifically referenced NuTech in my questions to them.  I also probably need to ask the comp committee about these "tolerable" conflicts of interest, particularly in light of recent press coverage of Enron.  We'll discuss that this afternoon, Nancy, but I am not feeling like we should agree to any of those types of provisions.  Yikes!

 David,  You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.  The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:  "Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."  This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.  Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.  As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.  Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Should we wait on this, given the possibilities we discussed earlier today.  Michelle 
 I can't find it on my blackberry. I can't remember who sent it, and the ones I've reviewed don't have the info.  Why don't you ask Shanna Funkhouser for the details?  Sorry about that!  Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 I think you should be there, so it can wait until later in the week.  Other priorities obviously govern.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 please send to him our consulting services agreement and also the agreement for contract and other services (Diane has the latest form).  cc to Carol St. Clare.  Thanks! 
 I would not want any of our policies to address what is "unlawful,"  as I believe that is a matter for a court. Instead, our policies should state what we want to have in them, and leave the issue of legality to others.  Plus, I wouldn't want any admission of unlawful conduct in our policies.  Michelle 
 yes.  I have contacts there, if you want.  Michelle 
 If it is same as mid-year, then I won't need to look at it.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Sorry, I don't.  Michelle 
 Jeff couldn't make it.  We'll reschedule at his availability.  MHC 
 Thanks, but no headhunters.   I can't afford a fee.  Michelle 
  FYI, if you didn't get this already.  Michelle 
 Twanda/Diane,  I've given the Japanese template to Twanda to revise -- please use the non-VP form and not the form on which I have made the revisions.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Robin,  Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports -- approximately $400K.  I know that Mary was involved in this to great detail.  Once the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for regular severance.  Mary and Tim Callahan have been coordinating those issues.  Michelle 
 David,  I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we are not dealing with Bidder D.  I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).  We probably can schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be affected 60 days' notice.  Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.  I'd prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer.  I would like more information about what is meant by "ENA does not interfere with" the offers made by the buyer.  Does that mean no counteroffers?  To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.  It is easier to commit only the wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc.  whether they will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group, if possible.  We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have been involved in this transaction.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Michelle 
 Was Clonch deposed?  What did he say?   Michelle 
 I haven't heard anything, but I would suggest that you have them stand down for the meantime.  Michelle 
 Richard, My thought is that the first sentence is ok, but not the second, and Bonnie is conveying that to McConville's lawyer.  MHC 
 Hello, everyone.  No need to work on Canary any more -- it is off.  I would suggest that you save your work in the event that it is revived, but it doesn't look like it is going to happen any time soon.  Michelle 
 My understanding is that the deal is dead -- stop the presses.  Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and explanations.  Perhaps we will work together again in the future.  Michelle 
 Molly,  Let's schedule interviews with Bechel with Mark Haedicke, Elizabeth Sager, Sheila Tweed, Dan Lyons, and Lisa Mellencamp.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 re Mariner 
 Mark,  As you requested, below is a list of my major accomplishments for the year.  1. Resolution/management of pre-litigation and litigation matters, including:  Dwayne Hart/Utilicorp; Satterwhite; Barrington; Race/Statoil; Ross Malme; Rick Blandford; West Boettcher; Anita Suson; Charlie Weymms; Steven Cuneo; others.  2.  Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost 200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting services agreements).  3. Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the OFCCP's "glass ceiling" audit of ENA and all of Enron).  4. Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power, Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen, and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel. Many of these transactions require extensive legal support relating to personnel matters after closing.  5. Legal support on labor (union) matters, including successful closing of project labor agreements for the construction of generation assets (e.g., Pittsburg, 2000 peakers, Pastoria), Unfair Labor Practice matters, training on union-related issues in M&A's.  Let me know if you need any more information, and thanks for your support!  Michelle 
 Greg, we live very close to you!  We have to get together soon.  I have sent you an invitation to our New Year's Day party, and I hope you can come.  By the way, congrats on all the success and good press on Fusion.  It is well deserved!  Merry Christmas!  Michelle 
 Gary, would you please send me by email the telecommuting policy and the agreement for telecommuters?  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Jeff, here is information from Jon Chapman.  Let's discuss when you have a chance to review it.  Michelle   -----------------  Michelle,  Further to our discussion on Tuesday , I am very happy to proceed on the basis of Jeff Dodd's draft Agreement ( and draft Data Protection Policy) . Can you ask him to prepare a final version and let us have it , please.  The EU "Data Exporter" entities are as follows:-  UK  Enron Europe Limited (also Italy ) Enron Power Operations Limited Enron Teesside Operations Limited Enron Direct Limited Enron Engineering Services Caxios Limited  Norway and Sweden  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  Germany  Enron Energie GmbH  Finland  Enron Finland Energy OY  Spain  Enron Espana Energia S.L.  Note that Norway is not a member of the EU but , as a member of the European Economic Area , should be treated as an EU member for these purposes.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.  Jon 
 Thanks, Dan.  We will work to accommodate your schedule. 
 Twanda, would you please save these to my form directory and print them out for me?  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please make this a form and save.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Danny, I received another call from the lawyers interested in learning information about Chapparro.  Any information?  Michelle 
 Jeffrey,  Thanks for the "thanks."  Also, thanks to you for the big wine bucket.  We used it at our New Year's Day party, and it worked great.  I must admit, though, that I still don't understand the purpose of the round thing that goes in the bottom.  I heard that Nathan took 30 steps the other day.  That is awesome!!  I know that you are thrilled.  Cameron's birthday party will be March 18 at 3:30 at Gymboree.  If your kids will be able to attend, let me know.  Talk to you later -- gotta go now.  Michelle 
 Richard, have you been involved in this?  Robert Knight asked about it. Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Mark,  Unfortunately, I do not know anything about EcoElectrica.  I contacted Michelle Blaine at the former EI (thinking that there was some confusion between Blaine and Cash).  Her assistant contacted me and said that, apparently, Coralina Rivera at the former EI has information about Eco Electrica in Puerto Rico.  I have left Coralina a message indicating that you are looking for information about EcoElectrica and requesting that she contact you directly.  Let me know if I can do anything further on this matter.  Michelle 
 Thanks for the consideration -- I did not expect much.  Also, I have faxed you my comments on response to Malme's motion to extend time to designate experts.  The comments should be self-explanatory.  Call me with any questions -- or have Tim call me.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Kerry,  Based upon your review of the attached, is there any way that one of our=20 subsidiaries could decline to include bargaining unit personnel in receipt = of=20 this benefit?  Let me know asap.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle

 Attached is a memo that I am currently working on with Rick Johnson.  Please review and provide me with any comments. Rick will be in the Houston office for the next two days.  Thanks 
 Twanda, could you please check to see if we have this?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 TWanda, we need an amendment to this agreement.  Would you please do the form?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 John,  Would you confirm (via a new email that I can print for my files) you have had the conversations with Dan Bruce, etc. about Entelligence that I scripted for you in a prior email?  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 Ok, you told me nothing, so I am clueless as to what is creating the distress.  Maybe we can chat later.  We will not be in Austin in the next few months.  We are going to San Antonio the first weekend in March, as well as the first week in April.  The first trip is for a wedding between two friends of Trey from Rice MBA who are marrying each other.  The other is for the Enron law conference, which is Wed.-Friday.  We are not taking Cameron on either of those trips (party time!!), so we will be rushing back to Houston right afterwards.  I am working with Butch Hayes at F&J.  I haven't been too involved in the matter because it is not an Enron subsidiary, but from what I can tell, I like him.  Any additional insight, if necessary, would be great.  Too bad you weren't in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  But, it probably would have been a sad time for all of you, and it sounds like you don't really need that right now.  If you visit us, we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if you need it -- not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.  Plus, Cameron acts like a 2-year-old, which is a delight.  He started at a new school a few weeks ago (The Post Oak School -- a Montessori school about a block from our house), and he is really coming into his own.  It is amazing how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.  Little things like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events (don't even get me started on helicopters).  On the other hand, I feel this enormous responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world. Quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.  Enough waxing philosophical.  I've got to get out of here at some point, so I'd better get back to work.  Later.  M 
 Kate and Felicia -- that org chart was from me.  I thought there was an enclosure note.  Sorry!  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please make this a form entitled "Canada Release" and then draft one for John Gorman?  I'll fill in the blanks.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Peter,  I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized workforce.  I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a deadline of 12/15.  Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues. You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there are employees and unions from my clients in HR.  That makes me and the legal department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service for Enron.  Please provide me with information about this deal asap.  And, I repeat my request to get me involved earlier on future deals.  Thank you.  Michelle 
 David, FYI.  Let me know if you have any comments, which I will give to Dawn.   I'll review it and get back with Dawn. 
 Attached is a draft letter to Duke Energy re the above-referenced. 
 Yikes!!!!   I can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there. I am sure that you are all "talked out" about it, but if you need an empathetic ear, give me a buzz.  Talk to you later.  Michelle  PS  I saw Julie Parraguirre last night, and she told me to say hello.  She is going to be teaching at the same school that Cameron attends! 
 Great.  Our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on Saturday night.  If you want to attend, let me know, and we will get tickets.  It is Cleopatra -- a world premier -- and it should be entertaining.  I understand if you don't want to join us, though.  Ballet isn't for everyone.  Let me know.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please print this out and also print out the consulting services agreement form for my review with this.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Hello.  Do you think this should be included in our consulting agreement form?  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please make this change to all forms?  Thank you.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please print all these.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Drew,  At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.  I think that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we begin to move towards shared services across the organization.  Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we really need to put some in place).  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please save this as a form.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the best.  I could use 5x7" the most.  Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.  We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know.  See you later.  Michelle 
 Please print the email and the attachments.  Thanks.  MHC

 TWanda, please print and then save the attachment as HR Confidentiality /Non-Solicitation agreement -- print for my review and editing.  Thanks a lot.  MHC 
 I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP incentive plan.   She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.  Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the plan.  Jeanne, could you please circulate one?  I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this process should not wait for me.  Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we should be ready to finalize it.  Michelle Cash 
 Attached is a letter to Sue Haynes and Samantha Ray re confidentiality. 
 Call me if you have any questions.  I hope this is better late than never! Michelle 
 Elspeth, do we want to do a new agreement, or simply assume the obligations in the old one?  If the former, I'd do a new agreement.  If the latter, I believe I simply can do an assignment agreement, once I receive a copy of the current agreement.  It also depends on the language in the old one, and whether we believe it protects ENA.  So, we'd have to look at it.  Sharon, do you have the file on this person?  If so, let me know, and I will have someone come and pick it up.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are details on one search firm for legal.  thanks.  mhc 
 Jeff,  What is the status of the document?  I expect that Jon will be calling me any day.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please save this in whatever power point directory you have.  Then, print for me to revise for a presentation to Energy Operations for Norma. Save this one, though, because the one I am going to use for Energy Ops will be much shorter, and this one has good stuff in it!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Kerry, thanks for this -- wow, is it long!  Michelle

 How is the research going on whether we can set up the plan the way we want to?  My understanding is that you were going to do some research for us. Thanks.  Michelle

 Rick, are you on this, or should I get on it?  Michelle 
 Hi, Charla,  I have reviewed the additional fields you described.  Most of them look fine with me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from any other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity. What is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a person is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have a field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the situation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work visa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.  The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth information that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it really is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is there a less intrusive way to ask it?  Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that inquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?  Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be unwise for the reasons I cited above.  If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call.  Michelle 
 I inadvertently forgot to "Reply to All" when I sent this response to Charla.  Michelle

 Jon, it was attached to the bottom of his prior email, which I will resend to you right now.  MHC 
 Any idea why they did this?  Michelle 
 That was sent to you by messenger.  Getting it notarized may take a long time -- is it necessary?  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please print this for me?  Thanks.  MHC--my printer is not working (or maybe I haven't selected my local printer correctly)

 Pete,  I learned today of a deal involving a newsprint plant in New Jersey, which you are running from the legal side.  Are there any issues involving personnel or labor involved in this deal?  If so, I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I've asked them for dates, and I've got them from 2 of them.  Let me bug them again early next week.  Tell him to chill out -- his client's deposition has been scheduled and rescheduled too many times to count.

 Jim/Don,  Do you know anything about this for Ecogas?  Michelle Cash 
 Kerry,  What are your thoughts on this issue?  Michelle    Michelle,  We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.  For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the Night (N) shift.   M T W Th F S  REG  8 8 8 8 8 OT       8 SHIFT  N N D D D D   Interpretation 1  The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:  REG  $400 SHIFT       16 OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)   Interpretation 2  Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as follows:  REG  $400 SHIFT       16 OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)  Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them?  Thanks for your help, Diane 
 David,  I am with you.  In fact, I sent this issue to outside counsel earlier this week because I simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts.  I expect an answer by Monday or Tuesday.  Sorry I forgot to let you know about the status.  Michelle     David O'Dell@ENRON 06/09/2000 09:45 AM

 Jennifer,  Thanks for the email.  Cameron is great.  He loves his new school, even though it is not as "working parent friendly" as Cathedral House was.  Cameron also loves fire engines (and ambulances, and tow trucks, and bulldozers and ..... ).  We took Cameron to the Bellaire EMS Open House a few weeks ago.  He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver's seat and "drive."   They also handed out plastic fireman's hats. He had a blast!  I look forward to having you back on 36;  I'm moving there as soon as they get my phone/computer set up -- I'll spend half days there.  See you later.  Michelle     Jennifer Milligan 06/13/2000 03:24 PM 
 Earline,  The questions are as follows:  1.  Has Enron provided Ecogas with such coverage for its non-Enron board members so far? 2.  What is the general scope of such coverage?  Ecogas is a stand-alone company.  Enron owns about 85 percent of its stock and has three people on its Board.  I hope that helps.  Michelle     Earline Kendall 06/14/2000 10:19 AM 
 Shelly, because he should have received this much sooner, we should hand deliver the check as soon as we get it from AP if it is not done through direct deposit.   If it is, then mailing the pay advice is ok.  Thanks. Michelle     Shelly Pierce@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 06/15/2000 01:13 PM 
 Hector,  Where are we with regard to the investigation into this matter?  I know that you've got a lot going on, and I didn't want that one to fall through the cracks.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential  In our meeting on Friday, we talked about the summary of complaints that you three are going to do.  If possible, I would like to receive those by Tuesday night so that they can be reviewed on Wednesday.  We are meeting with Beck/Olson on Thursday.  Let me know if that is impossible -- I know you all are swamped with zillions of other things!  Thanks.  Michelle

 Trey, it looks like I may have to be in Portland for a mediation on July 27 -- with travel on the 26th and the 28th.  Are you planning to be gone then, too?  If not, I'll schedule this trip (wanna join me with CAC and spend the weekend?).  I hope you are having fun and not working too hard.  Don't worry too much about me.

 Sheila, do you think we should meet with Rick Buy about this?  Or, should we talk about it without Rick and then respond accordingly?  The bottom line is, that the non-compete probably should stay as is, even in the case of RAC. Let's discuss.

 Jim,  If you are sure you don't want reimbursement, then thanks a lot!!!  I hope that you both can join us.  If not, let's plan on another arrangement.  We are planning to stay at the Doubletree Suites in/near Georgetown (apparently, it is close to the Watergate).  It was way less expensive than the Embassy Suites we discussed the other day (approx. $100 per night!).  We are renting a car, though, so we can get around wherever we need to -- or, of course, we can take the Metro.  Talk to you later.

 Dear Gretchen:  Wow!  You are thinking ahead!  What is a Leap Pad?  Is it something computer related? I have never heard of it.  On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice and hot by then.  We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while we are there, so that is good.  We got new furniture in the living room -- a chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.  It amplified the need for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we go!  Stay cool -- Michelle  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------  Michelle Cash Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3823 Houston, Texas  77002 (713) 853-6401 michelle.cash@enron.com  This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

 Thanks for the description.  Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went onto Amazon.com to look at it.  It looks like a cool toy that Cameron would enjoy.  FYI:  the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys.  As a matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to DC in August!  But, we can wait til Christmas, so go ahead with your plans.  Congrats on the furniture.  I am sure that you will be happy with it and will love the new look.  See ya.

 Dee,  I left you a voice mail yesterday, but I wasn't sure if you were in.  There is a new deal -- Project E2/Endeavor.  It is in the preliminary stages, but the deal team (led by Don Miller) would like to have data regarding the average cost of Enron employee benefits, broken down by type of benefit, if possible.  I assume that you would have that type of data and could forward it to Don and me.  Let me know if I should be contacting someone else.  Thanks a lot!

 Cheryl,  Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I had a blast with you being here.  I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.  I still have the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).  Cameron perked right up after the antibiotics kicked in.   He is his usual self today (happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.  I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.  gotta go.  Michelle 
 Enron North America had some summer clerks this summer.   Generally, we do not hire lawyers without significant legal experience (i.e., more than 6 years) unless they have some extraordinary skills and abilities (e.g., someone with lots of Enron experience).  I hope that helps.

 Pat, here is additional information about the transaction we have been working on.  Of course, they are going to finalize tomorrow.  I agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation.  Do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk?  My thought would be to request an indemnity for the t.i. claim if it is received.  Alternatively, we can ask for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that  the buyer be a beneficiary/waived party.  Any ideas?  Michelle 
 Amy,  Is Patrick Chris Mallory located in Portland or in California?  If California, then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes are not enforceable in California.  Let me know.  (I hope he is in Oregon!)  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat,  I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement for Greg Whalley.  I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation of value for options/restricted stock.  For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my assistant send it under separate email cover.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Here's the latest.  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained  The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be "represented" by a co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.  Employees in unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended by the NLRB's ruling.  The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be appealed quickly.  Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed before responding to that request.  We want to be careful to avoid a finding of an unfair labor practice.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Kristina,  Attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ENA voluntarily (although I don't really know why we limit it to voluntary terminations -- I have to look into that).  I also will send you by messenger the draft letter to a company (which I don't have on the system) and the letter I sent to the individual we discussed.  I hope these help.  Let me know if you would like additional information.  Michelle 
 Molly, my meeting with Carlos is at 3:30 on Friday.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp.

 t:  please print for me.  thanks. mhc 
 Amy,  It looks like my presence in Portland is iffy at this point.  There are other ways to do the training if you still want it asap.  Otherwise, I can schedule it a few weeks from now.  I'll give you the details as I confirm my situation with the Portland trip.  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication This E-Mail Contains Legal Advice  In the Barbed Wire Purchase Agreement is the provision that the Purchaser has 45 days to identify those employees of Company whom it would like the Company to terminate from employment prior to closing.  The Seller is providing a limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.  The indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those employees.  This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.  The indemnity exclusion also could be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.  Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  I can assist  you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.  Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.  Michelle Cash x3-6401 
 Attached for your review is a memo from Michelle and Kriste regarding the above referenced.  memo  Assignment Letter 
 I am going to send these one at a time because they want all fit in one email. 
 Twanda, could you please print for my review?  Thanks a lot!  MHC 
 t; please prnt for me thx 
 Ann, I am following up on the status of the research involving Section 6.4 of the SPA; specifically, what are the potential liabilities of Enron selecting persons for termination and providing those names to the Seller?  I would like to have this research asap because our time table is very short.  Do you have any information on that?  Thanks.  Michelle Cash 
 I will look closely at the sample letters to see whether there is any way to avoid the conclusion you have reached, which appears to be the correct one. I have a meeting right now, and will focus on it right after that -- I'll send another email once I've completed that review early this afternoon. Michelle 
 Gracie,  Based upon my brief review of her comments, many are not acceptable.  Without a convincing explanation, I am not going to delete entire sections of our agreement, particularly when those sections protect Enron.  Please get with her (not by copy of this privileged email) and ask for reasons why she wants the changes.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dee, what do you think?  I suggest that we let them handle that, but defer to your opinion.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI, here is information relating to the voice mail I forwarded to you late Friday.  I will be on vacation the dates they want to handle diligence, so one of you may need to handle it.  Let's see what happens. . .  Michelle 
 fyi.  michelle 
 t:  Please print for me.  Thanks a lot! Michelle 
 Scott,  I would love to attend, except that I will be out of the office on vacation that whole week.  It sounds like a great presentation!  Would you mind if I forward it to some other folks in corporate legal who might be interested (i.e., my counterparts)?  Thanks.  Michelle    Enron North America Corp. 
 TWanda, I assume that you have these saved somewhere?  If not, would you? Thanks.  Michelle 
 Debi, I will prepare a draft response for you.  Michelle 
 Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can find an alternative.  Michelle 
 I agree with your approach.  MHC  PS, I am out next week on vacation.  Call Twanda to arrange for assistance while I am out, and she will refer you on.  Agreements will be done during my absence; again, work with Twanda.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Here is the note that went out.  I'm giving a speech this morning and will be out all afternoon, but I will try to catch you in between.  Also, I am in tomorrow, but then am out all next week on vacation.  While I am out, you can work with Emma Caplan.   Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are others who want to interview Carlos.  I tell you what -- before you schedule any of these, let me talk with Carlos first to see where his interests lie.  Keep these names, and I'll keep you posted on who to schedule with him.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Debi,  Your plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.  My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially since their "proven track record" is only for one placement.  It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption is not correct.  Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks for handling that!  We are looking forward to our trip.  I'll call you when we get in and let you know our details.  I look forward to seeing you, Mary Lou, and Peter, if available.  See you soon!  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice  Hoyt and Melissa,  I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not really familiar with the specific facts here.  The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.  If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers.  I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about 11 this morning, but am available after that.  Michelle 
 Bret,  I received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on Project Crane and have forwarded it to Rick Johnson, Fran Mayes, Pat Mackin, and Dee Lenfest.  We have preliminarily decided that Rick Johnson will go to both sites to cover Labor (union) issues and support in the general HR diligence that Fran Mayes of ENA HR will conduct.  Either Pat or Dee will travel to Washington to address benefits issues, including obtaining information for subsequent modeling of benefit costs.  We would like to have our outside counsel in Canada conduct the benefits diligence in the Quebec City location and to support Rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of Canadian or Quebec law.   I will continue to coordinate these activities and provide whatever other assistance may be needed.  Let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for employment/labor matters.  I will work with Peter Del Vecchio to identify our outside counsel designee.  Michelle 
 would you please print this and attachments and put a sticky note on them that it is for Anonymous Letters project -- so that I focus on it!  thanks. mhc 
 Debi,  I will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes from CS at this time.  I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time, but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed.  That way, we aren't making it an absolute ban.  Thanks for the information.  Michelle 
 I certainly agree with the concept.  It sounds like it gives us more flexibility. 
 Debi,  Your response should go as follows.  I suggest doing it in writing, rather than an email that could be manipulated.  If you have theri fax number, that probably would be best.  Also, I suggest that we ask CS not to identify us as a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity materials.  We prefer to keep our vendor list private.  Dear Ms. Poss,  Thank you for your written  request for a reference on Contracting Solutions.  It is not our practice to provide references for contracting agencies.  I would suggest that you contact another company that does business with Contracting Solutions to obtain the information you seek.  I am sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives.  By the way, I spoke with Jennifer Cronin, who had referred your call to me. She indicated that you had identified Contracting Solutions as the subject matter of your request.  Sincerely yours, Debi Vanwey 
 Hoyt,  I have reviewed the attached.  I think it looks good.  It strikes the balance of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the future.  Kriste, any other thoughts?  Michelle 
 Alan, he's out of town until Friday, so I will schedule early next week with you and Dan.  Others are interested as well, so we'll probably have a full interview schedule with him.  Thanks for the quick response.  Michelle 
 I have not prepared one and am not aware of one in place -- that is why I prefaced my comments with that.  Randy's email made it sound like there was one. Sorry I'm not more help on this.  Michelle 
 I'd suggest finding otu more information.  My inclination would be not to accept the contractor. 
 As you know, we have another power plant project -- if I haven't forwarded information to you yet, I will be doing so in the next day or so.  The schedule is for preliminary diligence to be completed by 9/8; data room is open 9/6.  Attached to the email I will be sending you is a list of the current information we have here -- lots of documents are here.  Please review the data list and forward to me which ones you want copied, and I will coordinate that process.  The stock purchase agreement draft will be circulated next week.  Michelle 
 Sure.  Dick is an outside consultant.  His name is Dick Jeanerette.  His number is 713-650-6535.  Thanks, and have fun in MA.  Michelle 
 FYI, it sounds like they now are organized about the process in New York. Michelle

 David,  Hello, I hope all is well with you.  I was out last week on holiday and am just now getting back into the swing of things.  Alan and I have spoken about your contract, and I am getting in touch with the CU lawyers to work on an appropriate form for Australia.  I will be keep you apprised of the status.  Have a good weekend.  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential  Felicia,  Would you please run a disparate impact analysis for the proposed stock options to be granted within Enron Net Works?  I would like this data for the purpose of giving legal advice.  Thank you.  Michelle 
 Dear Mr. Catanzariti:  My name is Michelle Hoogendam Cash, Assistant General Counsel-Enron North America Corp.  I was referred to you by David Minns in the Enron Australia office. I am attaching a copy of our Employment Agreement Form for your review in light of Australian law.  Please review this form and provide me with any comments that you may have.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  If you have any questions, please give me a call at (713) 853-6401. 
 I agree.  Thanks for letting them know about my contact.  I emailed them the form, so we should be on our way!  Michelle 
 David, I did not receive the package in interoffice mail.  Could you email it to me or re-send it by fax at 646-3490?  Thanks!  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 Hoyt,  Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages in exchange for a release.  We need the title/position and the age of the persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as well as the persons who were not offered a package.  We will provide this data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Attached is an Agreement and Release Form that Michelle would like for you to review.  She is on the phone with you now regarding this attachment. 
 Brian,  Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.   I think he has a good idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.  Currently, it is done on an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.  Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?  It would be an excellent start.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Sheryl, sorry, I had the wrong email address.  Here is the resend.  Michelle 
 I hadn't heard about Alex's offer. That is great!!  He is such a nice guy. I'll send details on hen night later.  Michelle 
 please print this and attachment for me.  thanks.  mhc 
 Here are the latest!!!  Michelle 
 fyi re:  Lutz.  mhc 
 Rick,  It sounds like this may satisfy CURE, but I question whether this is an appropriate payment.  I would want to touch base with the lawyers working on the deal to find out if there are any implications.  Any other feedback? Michelle 
 Hoyt -- actually, we need only the New York office -- other locations should not be included.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks,  I'll be there.  Michelle

 FYI re:  Crane 
 Hello, girls.  If Stacey can do it, so can I!  Here are the latest pictures of Cameron. These were taken right before the Baptism of my sister's third (can you believe it??) child, so he is all dressed up.  I hope all is well with everyone.  Love, Michelle 
 Andrea,  Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think?  Michelle 
 Hoyt, Here is a privileged and confidential legal memorandum regarding the Garden State modification of operations.  Let's discuss these issues tomorrow or Friday.  Michelle 
 Please see the note below, which was forwarded to me by Richard Sanders, on Triple Lutz.  Michelle 
 CPage:  Would you please forward this directly to Pat?  Pat, For your information, Chris Tomko has resigned from GSP.  GSP has hired a consultant, Hoyt Thomas (who has been working as an Enron HR consultant for a few weeks), to handle interim HR responsibilities until GSP hires a new HR person.  I suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling in the next few weeks as this transition occurs.  If you are available on Friday, I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt.   Would you please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-6401, to let her know your availability so that she can set up a conference call?  Thanks a lot.  Twanda, would you please set this up when Pat calls?  Michelle 
 great, Andrea, shall we discuss rollout asap?  Thanks!!  Michelle 
 Roberto,  These are good questions, and, in fact, are ones to which I am not certain of the answer (at least for #2).  Let's get together next week to discuss the specifics of how this program works and then determine the issues.  Twanda, would you please set up this meeting for me?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Bob, there also are legal issues to address, so I appreciate your keeping me in the loop as this evolves.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Molly, add her to the list for Carlos.  Also, could you find out who Bonnie Nelson has worked for in the past and provide me with that information so that we can call and make reference checks?  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Chuck,  Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?  Given the correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.  Otherwise, even if we do "agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.  I am ready to hear what this guy has to say about my client.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Drew, You are right on.  I do have the concerns raised in your prior email, but I did not want to commit those to writing.  I have asked to be kept in the loop, and will provide that input as needed in a meeting setting. Thanks.  Michelle 
 Ginger, I cannot attend that meeting, as I am in another.  I will be out of the office the rest of the week, so check with Twanda Sweet, my assistant, for rescheduling options.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I also want to be included in this discussion, but I do not want to commit my thoughts to writing.  So, count me in.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Andrea,  I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity. However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of that meeting.  I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.  Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you think?  Michelle  PS, do we need to include Don in our group? 
 TWanda, please print for me, including attachments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 fyi.  mhc 
 I would suggest working through Sheila Knudsen and the Compensation Council to get this done Enron-wide.  Let me know if that isn't successful.  Thanks. Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 No, just hold on -- we're waiting for final settlement documents from Reliant, with the Ajello release.  Michelle 
 tweanda, please print this and save as a form.  Then, put the print out in the Merger, Acquisition, and Divestitures Notebook on myu credenza-- just stick it inside there.  Thanks.  MHc 
 no, hold all of them until I speak with him -- we've obviously got a lot of interest!  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Amy, this looks fine, except I would delete the provision about exceptions, because there really are none!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are comments from Tom Moore regarding the proposed Services Agreement. I will circulate the draft SSD this week.  As always, I welcome additional feedback from the user groups.  Michelle 
 Gerry, this is too cryptic for me -- what was decided?  I'd like to go to the next meeting!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 David,  I will have this re-reviewed by Oregon counsel, but it was scrubbed about 18-24 months ago as being enforceable.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Bill, I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on Williams.  I hope that happened . . .   I would like to have a petition ready early next week.  It will be lawsuit only, not injunctive relief.  I believe Ajello will be finalized this week.  I sent our signed version to Reliant last week, and I hope to have it signed by Ajello soon.  Once that happens, we can dismiss.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate.  "Met" expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in Satisfactory.  Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would be more accurate.  Where are we on the total revamp?  Has that been postponed until next year?  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Davie --  Meets many, but may have some developmen needs works just fine.  I just don't want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets requirements when, in fact, there are developmental needs that are obvious when compared to persons in strong.  So, I am happy with your proposal (although I suggest that your second proposal does not meet the "fairly up" goal).  Cheers.  Mich 
 I have sent a mark-up of this to Dave.  Let's talk tomorrow around 10:00. Michelle     Fran L Mayes 10/09/2000 01:48 PM

 Here are the schedules.  MHC 
 Alice, for the employee we discussed last week, here is information on payee.  It doesn't look good.  Michelle 
 Hector/Valeria,  Do we have a rule against heaters?  If not, that seems to be the easiest solution, as well as the "dress warm" advice.  I think that moving him would not be good -- his isolation could work against our goals here.  Your thoughts?  Michelle 
 thanks, I look forward to your thoughts and comments.  michelle 
 Steve, I hope that I did not educate her too well . . . It was great to see you, and be sure to let me know if you can use my help in the future. Michelle 
 Kay, I will be out attending a seminar -- but, don't hold it up for me. Thanks!  Michelle 
 All is fine -- no disparate impact in the selection.  But, I still would like to see data about why certain persons were selected.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Cathy, what do we want to do with regard to Paskoff?  Remember, we were waiting until this week to respond to his requests for additional consideration?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Cathy,  Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as well as their title and age.  Please make sure that happens, or our waivers will not be valid.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Also, I never heard back from Ilya's lawyer.  Did he sign?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Jim,  FYI.  The second link here is about workers' comp insurance in California.  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please schedule a meeting with me, Hector, Sheila W., and Brian Schaffer re:  follow up to the Bashen information?  I would like to have this group discuss how to close the loop with Sally's employees and implement any recommendations for follow-up. I think the meeting with last approximately 1 1/2 hours.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I'll interview.  I'm available between 10-12 on Thursday.  Let me know when and where.  Michelle 
 Please print this and save it to my document list.  Thanks.  Michelle

 Pursuant to your request, attached is a draft letter to WiseSoft, Inc. regarding Hennadiy Batrak. 
 Anne,  I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.  From my perspective, it generally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.  In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds $250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of Section 4.13(iii).  Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.  In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any employment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.  In Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.  In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind to customers.  I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and provide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of Ethics may work here.  In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, or does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to "cash" payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock options/restricted stock that vest over time.  In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting -- Pat, do you know?  Should Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee Matters Agreement.  Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the purposes of dispute resolution?  Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions.  Michelle 
 Pat,  I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate email.  I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.  In terms of timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Here is a set of comments by Pat Mackin on the Triple Lutz agreement.  Cynthia/Mary, do you have anything to add?  Michelle 
 please excuse the delay on this --  If possible, I would like the following documents copied from the data room:  Leaf River:  Tab No.'s 20, 119-140, 146, and 168-170  Woodland:  Tab No.'s 107-130, and 136  Brunswick:  Tab No.'s 102-127, and 137  Thanks.  Michelle Cash 
 One other item:  Could you please request all employment contracts and change of control agreements, if any?  Thank you.  Michelle 
 Karen, does  Sean have his art on a web site anywhere?  I have someone who wants to look at it.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 Andrea, This looks good.  I have two nits:  First, the street value of our phone book is $1k, not $1. Also, "loosing" people should be "losing" people.  One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no filter on what employees can/can't put.  In other words, if an employee is working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.  One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron facility -- not remotely.  This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.  Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here is the attachment.  Thanks for the update on Delainey.  Michelle 
 REMINDER:   This email is to remind you that a meeting is scheduled for Monday, October 23rd from 4:00-5:00 regarding visa issues in EB38C2. 
 Attached is a draft from Michelle Cash. 
 fyi.  Michelle 
 Hector, we need to check with Kriste Sullivan on this.  I have a vague recollection about a group of employees going to Dynegy, and we had to send a demand letter to prohibit the improper use of Enron information.  She was involved, so could you please send her the email you sent to me?  Then, we can discuss a strategy.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 David,  I believe the agreement was signed.  It would have been a Corporate Services Agreement.  I believe that Shonnie Daniel or Steve Van Hooser worked on this.  I have cc'd this email to them so that they can provide you with a copy, forward it on to the appropriate person, or let me know if one never was signed, in which case I can prepare a new version.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 Here is the latest.  Michelle 
 FYI, particularly the part about the performance management system.  Let's see what kind of data we can get about the Microsoft evaluation system to find the differences.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Would you let me know which you choose?  I may need some of them as a backup!  Michelle 
 Twanda, please take the text of this email and turn it into a document that is presentable so that I can give it to Mark at our Quarterly Business Review Meeting at 2:00 Monday -- actually, I will need it by noon so that I can revise it.  Thanks.  Michelle    Transactions  Major Events of September - November 2000  Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.  Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees (including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.  Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.  Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.  E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.   Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.  East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.  Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.   Litigation  Major Events of September - November 2000  No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.  Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.  Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered mediation to follow.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.    Documents Generated  Major Events of September - November 2000  New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  Standard Agreements:  I prepared:  ___ draft employment agreements.  ___ draft consulting services agreements.  ___ separation agreement and releases.  ___ retention letter agreements.  The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our non-compete provisions.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus pool.  Investigations  Major Events of September - November 2000  Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]  Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation results led to termination of employment for cause.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated following PRC/bonus discussions.   Training  Major Events of September - November 2000  Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went through the first round.  Pre-Hire Testing  Major Events of September - November 2000  Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests will result in a successful employee.  Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selec
