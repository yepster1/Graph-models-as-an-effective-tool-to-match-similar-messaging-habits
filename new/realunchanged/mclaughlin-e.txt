 I am aware we have several pending items outstanding with Crosstimbers.  I am awaiting instructions from Charlie Otto, as he is negotiating/discussing the deals with Crosstimbers.  I just wanted to give you an update and let you know I have not forgottem about them.  Thanks,  Errol

 The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L as we discussed.  I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process (Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).  The P&L portion of the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.  Thanks for your help & patience,  Errol 
 Cecillia,  When we choose FIMAT as a broker in Exchange Capture, we can not save a deal because the account number section is blank.  Could you please fix this as soon as possible.  Please call me with any questions at X5-8274.  Errol

 Can you let me know when you plan on installing my Palm?  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Bob,  I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.     Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Trey,  I will book this tonight.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Deal QQ9854 does not become a NX3 swap until after Dec. 21, 2001, if it assigned.  Before then it has to be booked as a swaption expiring on Dec 21, 2001.  Thanks,  Errol 
 This deal has been changed to a NYMEX swap at $8.14.  Thanks,  Errol    Enron North America Corp.

 John,  Could you please have one of your book admin's send Marc Janichen the Brent curve from last night for the dates referenced below.  I took care of the gas curve he was looking for.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Jeff,  Derek stopped by after he talked to his wife over the phone and it looks like he will probably take the job.  He wants to talk to her again tonite, and he will let me know officially tommorrow.  So he can let Joe Hunter know -- any idea on when they'll want him to start?  Thanks,  Errol 
 Frank,  I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date. This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Per the message below, all of the remaining holidays in the system will be removed as business days tommorrow morning.  Please let me know if this is a problem for anyone.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin 
 I now have the deal tickets for N60753.4 & .6.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them from the Structuring group.  The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.  I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 The ordeal is finally over!  These deals are to be settled as NYMEX swaps.  Thanks,  Errol    Enron North America Corp.

 Jeff,  I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.  He is finishing up a project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.

 John,  Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 George,  How are you doing.  Well, I hope.  Could you just give me a quick shout and let me know when you think you will be able to start in our group.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Per your request, attached is the NG curve through Dec. 2024.    Please call with any questions that you have  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274. 
 Done. 
 I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.  Errol    Enron Capital Management 
 Bianca,  Could you please fax up to me confirms for the following deals:  QE1352.2 QF4333.2,3 QF6287.1 QF6446.1 N60753.4&6  I'm gathering these for Arthur Andersen auditing purposes, so it would be a great help if I could get this pretty quickly.  The fax # is 646-2496.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Mark,  Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were included in the information picked up Friday.  I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 713-853-0430.  Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.    I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron.

 Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How long do you have left?  I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.  What's up with the 'old' crack!

 Sharon,  How do I call you?  Each time I call you back, the phone goes to cover and there is no message, so I can't leave you a message.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Done. 
 Greg,  Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.  Deal QE 7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001.  Errol McLaughlin 
 The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out deals everyday.  EOL is only booking them to one leg.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Jeff,  For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps. The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let them change those deals too.  On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.  We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.  Errol 
 Shannon.  1124399, 1124401, 1124393  Thanks,  Errol 
 Frank,  After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.  Thanks -- I know it's a pain,  Errol 
 This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.  Thanks,  Errol L. McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that there is no message recorded.

Thanks,  Errol 
 Hey Johnelle,  It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now? When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage. Call me when you get a minute!!  Errol L. McLaughlin Lead - Financial Trading Risk Mgmt Enron North America Voice: 713-345-8274 Motorola 2Way Pgr: 1-877-241-1059 (8772411059@pagenetmessage.net)

 Agustin,  Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Dawne,  I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good.  QV0345 booked as a June deal instead of May 01.  The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration. If I'm not mistaken, the swaps should be NX1.  Thanks,  Errol

 How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.  Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm so sorry!).  Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.  ELM 
 done.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sue,  I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 I'll be there on the 18th.

 I'm there. 
 Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.  See you soon,  E.L.M. 
 I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these problems can be fixed before the morning.  The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.  Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,  Errol L. McLaughlin

 These annuities were paid to the counterparty after several deals we had with them were restructured.  George Gilbert (the originator responsible) has already confirmed the deals with the counterparty.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are positive value to the book.  A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000). The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Irena,    Thanks,  Errol 
 Jeremy,  John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid our position might not be correct as well.  Please give me a call.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Irena,  The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we won't have as many space issues in the future.  I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.  Thanks,  Errol

 Durch,  It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.  Errol 
 Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274

 Dawn,  John Arnold is now hitting the crude oil stacks.  Currently the deals are booking to NG-Price.  Attached is a completed new book request form with the short name for his new crude book - NG-Price-Crude.  We are changing the deals to the new book today, but we need them to start booking automatically tomorrow, if possible.  We can discuss in the meeting at 4 pm.  Thanks,  Errol 
 John,  In the Position folder.  I saved a file called 'GammaFile'.  The worksheet we looked at is called "calculator".  The password is: price.  Thanks,  Errol 
 BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.  Thanks, Errol    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please see the attached new book request for the NG-Price book.  John Arnold is now trading crude on EOL and they are booking to NG-Price.  Of course, we have to have this today.    Thank you,  Errol 
 Gotta check out the link below.  EM 
 Looks good.  Errol 
 Please check our books.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Dawne,  The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Shannon,  I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice mail.

 John,  After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.  This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.  A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.  Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.  I apologize for the error.  We just found it today, when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I will be there. 
 Heather,  Can you do me a favor.  The Reward Bucks application I filled out, was for Michelle Nelson.  I will be out all of next week.  If you get it next week can you have it sent to her.  She sits behind me at 3249B.  Her extension is X5-8091.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274

 John,  Are the 24 hr gas stacks going to be running on Thanksgiving and the Friday after (11/22, 11/23)?. EOL is asking.  Thanks,  Errol 
 hilarious 
 I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.  Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.  Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.  Thanks,  Errol

 Sounds good 
 Don't know what time on Monday. 
 Jeff,  The day after Thanksgiving is NXB4.  We (Price-Desk) have some special procedures we have to follow regarding swaption expiration.  Other than that, it should not be that different from a non-bidweeek day.  I apologize, I thought the 23rd was going to be NXB3.  In December, the day after Christmas (Wednesday) is NXB2 and the Friday before that is NXB3.  Monday and Tuesday are exchange holidays.  Thanks,  Errol

 Don't worry, I'll fill you in later. 
 You doubt my stamina & my prowess in holding my liquor--et tu Brute??!!!  I'm not feeling too bad - considering the time I got home.  I didn't want to wake you.  I've been doing the meeting circuit again this morning, so that has kept me lively.  The post lunch period when things are quiet is going to be brutal though.  How is your day going? 
 Attached, please find the book request in response to Nancy's e-mail.  Please call w/ any questions.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 I read it this morning.  It's absolutely brutal towards the end.  We'll talk more offline--if you know what i mean.  e

 Kam,  Did Brad answer your question?  I've been in NYMEX hell all day and I am not up on this issue.  Let me know if I can help further.  EM 
 Yes, I ran his book for a while when he was head of the gas floor.  I've done some other projects for him.  Hope the e-mail wasn't too bad.  Errol

 Tom,  The GasPow position is correct.  Thanks, Errol 
 Jeff,  I know you're pretty busy w/ everything going on, so this isn't top priority.  When you get a minute, could we talk about how Spec/Sr.Spec get into the Associate/Analyst program?  My guys (and myself for that matter) have seen and heard of people moving into the program and I am getting a lot of questions on the matter.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Guys,  Please make sure we have everything flipped out per the message below.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I haven't talked w/ him for awhile.  I will give him a call.

 Deal NL3722 is a deal between ECC and another counterparty.  It is not a John Arnold deal.  You will have to contact Ryan in Canada re: this deal.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Tony,  How's it going?  I just realized you left the weather group.  When you get a free minute, tell me a little about the new job.  Congratulations,  Errol  McLaughlin X5-8274 
 I reserved EBE3270 at 10am on Friday.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I have the same room, EBE 3270, for 9:30 am tommorrow.  Thanks,  Errol

 No problem.  Thanks for your help.  Errol 
 It's done.  Robin Rodrigue with the benchmark group has pulled this P/L in.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Greg,  Sherry Dawson took care of these deals today.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Hey Johnelle,  It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now? When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage. Call me when you get a minute!!  Errol L. McLaughlin Lead - Financial Trading Risk Mgmt Enron North America Voice: 713-345-8274 Motorola 2Way Pgr: 1-877-241-1059 (8772411059@pagenetmessage.net) 
 Sharon,  Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that there is no message recorded.  We looked at the October P/L and could not find an "Other" column with $9.2MM in it.  If you could, please give Robin a call at X5-7478, and she will be happy to answer your questions about this.  Thanks,  Errol 
 This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.  Thanks,  Errol L. McLaughlin 
 The total mark to market value for US Gas EOL deals as of 07/31/2000 was:  $274,477,942  Physical deals totalled $(375,805).  Financial deals totalled $274,853,749.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.  Thanks -- I know it's a pain,  Errol 
 Frank,  After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Jeff,  For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps. The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let them change those deals too.  On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.  We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.  Errol 
 Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out deals everyday.  EOL is only booking them to one leg.  Thanks,  Errol 
 The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Greg,  Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.  Deal QE 7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001.  Errol McLaughlin 
 Done. 
 Sharon,  How do I call you?  Each time I call you back, the phone goes to cover and there is no message, so I can't leave you a message.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How long do you have left?  I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.  What's up with the 'old' crack!

 I have all the info you are looking for at my desk.  I am located at 3248c. Give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Mark,  Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were included in the information picked up Friday.  I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 713-853-0430.  Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.    I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron. 
 Bianca,  Could you please fax up to me confirms for the following deals:  QE1352.2 QF4333.2,3 QF6287.1 QF6446.1 N60753.4&6  I'm gathering these for Arthur Andersen auditing purposes, so it would be a great help if I could get this pretty quickly.  The fax # is 646-2496.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.  Errol    Enron Capital Management 
 Done. 
 Per your request, attached is the NG curve through Dec. 2024.    Please call with any questions that you have  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274.

 John,  Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 John -- any day would be great!  Thanks, Errol

 Yes 
 As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are positive value to the book.  A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000). The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Jeff,  I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.  He is finishing up a project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.

 Sharon,  I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them from the Structuring group.

 Bob,  I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.     Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L as we discussed.  I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process (Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).  The P&L portion of the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.  Thanks for your help & patience,  Errol

 This book is for a VPP deal with the affiliate Star VPP, LP.  The Price desk has swaps with this counterparty and the other regional desks have basis deals.

Please call with any other questions,  Errol McLaughlin    Shannon McPearson @ ECT                02/21/2001 08:37 AM

 Shannon,  I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice mail.  Thanks,  Errol   Shannon McPearson @ ECT                02/26/2001 11:11 AM 
 Dawne,  The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Please check our books.  Thanks,  Errol 
 These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these companies.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Looks good.  Errol 
 Please see the attached new book request for the NG-Price book.  John Arnold is now trading crude on EOL and they are booking to NG-Price.  Of course, we have to have this today.    Thank you,  Errol 
 BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.  Thanks, Errol    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  In the Position folder.  I saved a file called 'GammaFile'.  The worksheet we looked at is called "calculator".  The password is: price.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Dawn,  John Arnold is now hitting the crude oil stacks.  Currently the deals are booking to NG-Price.  Attached is a completed new book request form with the short name for his new crude book - NG-Price-Crude.  We are changing the deals to the new book today, but we need them to start booking automatically tomorrow, if possible.  We can discuss in the meeting at 4 pm.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Please change these to BT.    Enron North America Corp.

 Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Durch,  It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.  Errol

 Irena,  The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we won't have as many space issues in the future.  I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Jeremy,  John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid our position might not be correct as well.  Please give me a call.

 Sue,  I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Dawne,  I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good.  QV0345 booked as a June deal instead of May 01.  The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration. If I'm not mistaken, the swaps should be NX1.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Thanks 
 I'll be there.  Errol 
 I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these problems can be fixed before the morning.  The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.  Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,  Errol L. McLaughlin

 Frank,  I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date. This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.  Thanks,  Errol

 Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.  See you soon,  E.L.M.

 How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.  Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm so sorry!).  Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.  ELM

 Homer,  I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to Email.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Done.  EM 
 Jim,  Thanks a lot for great basket - I just got it.  We'll call on Monday.  Errol 
 The basis curves corresponding to deals listed are saved in O:\ Dropbox \Errol\natsourcebasiscurves.  I.T. is still working on a fix for the Gas Daily curves.  I will let you know when we have something from them.  I let them know this was a time sensitive issue.  Thanks,  Errol
