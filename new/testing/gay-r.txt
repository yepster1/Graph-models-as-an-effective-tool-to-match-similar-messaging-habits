 events.  Thanks. 
 Barbara:  my e-mail address is Randall.L.Gay@ENRON.COM 
 Julie:  Thanks.  Let me know when you know something different. 
 Irena:  my wife's name is Kathleen. 
 ok 
 Richard:  is there any way that someone could act as your backup for the week you are off?  We can work around Suzanne's vacation schedule with others in her group.  Let me know if we can do anything about this.  Thanks.  Randy 
 Bob:  FYI, my guys tried again last night to update and were unable to. 
 Bob:   I am still wonderring why the external modems my group had were removed.  It seems like I am always having to order modems and accessories every time we move anyone.  Since we are getting ready to move again, maybe we should get an inventory of everything each logistic's person has at their workstation, and this is what should be moved. 
 I talked to Rick but he is on his way to SP to try and resolve the Petrobras consent.  I will try and put together a meeting for us to resol the issues. Thanks for your patience. 
 Isabel:  It is ok to pay this invoice per Randy Gay.  If you need anything else just let me know.  Thanks. 
 Looks good 
 fyi 
 Heather:  Jackie Adams will represent the West desk.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  here is the completed version with changes. 
 Let's try this with the attachment.  Thanks. 
 Heather:  can you proof this and get this ready?   Thanks. 
 Bob:  we probably need to get everyone together on this and come up with a consolidated stance before we go outside the group.  As you pointed out, there are several areas that could open us up to potential problems.  We want ot be careful not to get things out in the iopen that we do not want out. Thanks. 
 Let's move ahead.  The details appear to be complete. Thanks. 
 The evenings would work best for the West also. 
 Thanks 
 OK 
   Thanks Heather 
 Dave:  sounds good to the West. 
 Bob:  The problem we were having is that if they could get in, it would lock them up for up to 5 minutes and then kick them out.  This would happen over and over again.  They said it was alright from 7:30 to 8:30 am, then became unusable about 8:30.  It has gotten to the point that on most days when they get cut off and they have to log back in they do not even consider this a problem.  We need to get back to exceptional service so they do not have to keep logging back in.  Thanks Bob. 
 Scotty:  we definitely want this.  Thanks. 
 Hi beautiful.  Thank you for the pictures.  You look so good.  I still don't know when I will be able to come to Brazil.  Please write with your schedule so I can know when you will be there.  How are you doing? Is school going well?  I am anxious to hear you speak english.  I have been thinking of you a lot lately.  Kisses  Rob 
 could ya'll comment on this please?  Thanks. 
 Suzanne:  thanks for your help and your prompt attention. 
 per your request 
 None as of right now. 
 Phillip:  this should be to you instead of Bob Shiring. 
 Dave:  my concern not only is with the outage on Sunday, but what may happen between Sunday and Tuesday.  With everything else going on, I would hate for my group to come in here on Tuesday and have problems on top of everything else.  We are going to be having a lot to do and I would feel more comfortable without this distraction.  Let me know what you think. 
 Samantha:  could you please set Josh up to talk wityh me ASAP?  Thanks.  Randy 
 I couldn't get my e-mail to work, so I am using Randy's..... I am having trouble selling our length on PG&E for November.  Is there any way we can settle financially instead of selling the imbalance.  (it is around 16,000).  Let me know  Kim Olinger 
 Patti:  Thanks Scotty 
 No problem 
 The list looks great, although perhaps not all inclusive.  As new issues arise we will add to the list. 
 Ken:  currently we get outside E-mails from PIRA and Enerfax on a daily basis.  I do not believe we would be at a disadvantage if these were blocked the last week.  Thanks.

 I don't know if you heard but I resigned on Friday, but I will be around until Feb. 28.  My plan is to retire for a while. I have attached a picture of a cabinet I made to give you an idea of how I will be keeping my hands busy.  You know what they say - "Idle hands are the devil's workshop".  Beija  Rob 
 E-mail from Nov. 8, 2000 I was thinking of you today and I remembered a long conversation we had at the office one morning when we both arrived before everyone else.  You were wearing this pastel sun dress and you looked incredible.  I am thinking of you now too ... 
 Will do. Thanks.   Mary, please give me a call when you have a free minute. I have some news. 
 This is one of the things I will be doing to stay busy. 
 Lammers is driving this but I recall that this has far reaching consequences for tax. I suggest you intervene immediately.  regards,   Rob 
 Yes. They are actually antique windows that I found at an antique store and decided to feature in the cabinet.  It is really fun to visualize something like that and then make it happen. It happens a whole lot faster than Int'l Project Finance too!! 
 The call tomorrow is to discuss legal strucutre of the ECA and is not a numbers call.  We will need plenty of number soon though so please proceed.  Thanks 
 I am not receiving any of the lender comments that were discussed below. Please keep me informed and include me in any discussions if possible as well.  Thank you.  The Designated Financial Groundhog 
 What's that number?  I think you said 917-971-0676. 
 I was just thinking about how much fun you are.  Since you asked for more pictures ... 
 I think we are going to have a hard time making this meaningful this week.  I suggest we postpone and we will advise everybody immediately if there is movement with Eletrabras and Furnas.  Thanks everyone. 
 Jose,  The lenders were wondering where we are with Tozzini on the memo covering interconnection. Not that you don't have enough to worry about. 
 The discussions went well on the ECA this morning and there are no issues of any great significance left, other than Shell's sponsor buyout proposal.  We have one turn of the document to do but we are in good shape here (I guess that is to say we are perfectly positioned to offer millions and millions in sponsor support).  I want to take just a little more time on the model to make sure everything we send will tie, but we will get it to them  on  Monday for sure. 
 Rick,  I'm not sure Felipe understands that he needs to finalize the model with me first before he sends around a "lender package" for the senior guys to review. We are still trying to make everything make sense, make certain strategic decisions on presentation, and make all of the presentations tic and tie as Connie would say.  I believe we will have no problem accomplishing all of this by early Monday and then you and Laine can review and make additional changes if you like.  We can talk on Monday as well about how we handle Shell, but an expedited approach should be doable with the right spin.  However, I am concerned that the base case you agreed with Johanas is no longer accurate given the status of Laine's negotiations.  I did not understand specifically your question about cash below.  Could you clarify this particular concern further for me so I can look into it.  I am going to get much closer to the model this time than last because of the turnover due to Robert and Joana moving on.  Give me a call if there is anything else you want me to look into.  Regards, Rob 
 You and I are on the same page here.  I was aware of this, I'm just trying to figure out how to present this in a way that it does not invite much review or discussion.  It is one of the few elements which have to bridge the budget and the cash flow statement.  I am hopeful that the lenders will continue not to focus on it since there is no assurance that it will be received and more astute lenders would probably make us guarantee it. 
 Once again it is our intention to have the $21MM count toward the Budget. What is not firmly established is the total budget amount. We are removing the contingency which reduces the budget but that is offset by some fuel oil expense and F/X expense which is increasing.  Please plan for you and Laine to be available Monday AM to make sure we are all on the same page once this all settles. 
 Mary,  thanks so much for your note.  In terms of managing costs this is a little like trying to save money on the project by turning out the lights in my office when I go home; However, I have noticed over the course of this deal that FF failed to accuratrely reflect the business deal on a number of occaisions when issues were resolved verbally.  This resulted in things having to be revisited and rehashed in a costly manner.  Therefore, with the ECA, I attempted to reach agreement on the commercial structure first and actually reflect the result in the table.  The concern I raised with Nancy was the fact that even when given a written record of the result reached by the business people, the document provided still reflected the principal terms poorly.   We were able to resolve this problem on Fridays call, but the call was costly (outside lawyers in attendance were Melissa, Stefan, Cliff, Mathew, and I believe Juliana).  In fact things went swimmingly on the call primarily because there was no new ground being broken.  I am just trying to improve things a little bit with this discussion.  I remain extreemely appreciative of all of your efforts and I think the world of Melissa and the job she has done on this project.  Thanks for listening. 
 John, I jjust reviewed the interconnection memo from Claudia. Once again it is weak on the situation and our remedies.  Can you help Jose try to pull this together. 
 This is the type of thing I'll be doing for the forseable future. It has been great working with you.  Regards,  Rob 
 I have been relying soley on Jose and Claudia for interpretations of the relevant regs. I have not seen Enlish translations of the regs or the CCT & CUST so I don't know how we get charged. I think Jose has some idea and I seem to recall US$.0007/kw-hr but I don't have anything official. 
 Novak and I are still working on it. John's view is that the legal analysis provided by Tozzini is not supportable based on the facts of certain regs, etc.  We are trying to decide what are the implications so we can advise the banks. It seems that we probably do need to assign the agreements. 
 What's up with Laine and the incompetence routine? 
 Please confirm my inferences:  1) The Southeast curve has been provided by the MAE in its official capacity (do we have a reference from a press release or publication?) 2) I assume the Southeast curve predicts the maximum marginal cost expected to be dispatched for each period. Is this correct?  Is this for Peak demand periods?  Do we have a prediction on an intra-day basis? 3) The graph seems to  predict that EPE's cost will be below the Southeast curve; therefore we can epect full dispatch (?) 
 Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:  1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)  2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the corrective measures.]  3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if dipatched above 220 MW.  If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue Garvin flex months.  Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses. Any data you can provide will be helpful.   Have I successfully connected the dots here?  If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something done.   Regards,  Rob 
 Way to go Keith.  You should be very proud of what you accomplished here and I think the vision of what you set out to do continues.  Best of luck in the future.  Rob 
 Fyi 
 FYI 
 Thanks Rick,  I too was concerned that he thinks I am pointing fingers.  Although I think the people with the authority also ultimately have to accept the responsibility, I think Laine has done an incredible job on many fronts simultaneously (and I have said so to Mariella when queried).  However, maybe this thing is just bigger than all of us. I just don't know any more.   It's true there is a lot of pressure and I'm sure Laine is absorbing most of the blows.  I have taken a lot of heat from Global Finance and Kishkill myself.  It's true that over the last 6 months I have not always been able to pay attention to the flood of e-mails this project generates each day. However, as you know, my style is to focus on a task with great intensity so I usually find the e-mails relevant to the issue I have square in my sights.  It's also true that on a number of occaisions I have been inadvertantly left out of the loop (such apparently was the case here).  I think it is unreasonable to assume that I have seamless communication with Tracee and Felipe or that these two young associates can even discern everything that is important. They are really struggling with the complexity of this project, everything is new to them, and they don't have the benefit of experience to know what is normal.  As a result, increased patience and communication are in order.  At this point I am trying to insure that the model we put in front of the lenders is credible and if we elect to present an undocumented issue in our favor than I want to be sure that I can defend the position.  I think we made great strides in toward developing a story which hangs together yesterday, although albeit in a painful fashion.  I want to reassure both you and Laine that I am committed to getting this done, I no longer have anything on my plate but this, and I am not going to break ranks when questioned by  the numerous folks nosing around.  The tough projects are what determine what we are made of.  I am comfortable with you forwarding these comments to Laine at your discretion. 
 Could you please take a moment to rspond on the attached. Thanks You 
 Thanks Christiaan,   but, why not 2 combustion turbines at 90 MW's each and the steam turbine fro whatever we can get? 
 Britaldo Soarez would like to have a brief note indicating all of the things you are currently working on.  Thanks  Britaldo,  In summary, this is what is left on our plates:  Cuiaba I - Rob Gay  RioGen - unassigned  WestLB CAA - Peter Anderson, Cheryl Lipschutz  Elektrobolt - Peter Anderson, Runabir Dutt  Cuiaba II - Peter Anderson  GTB Expansion - Brian Swinford  Transredes Expansions - Brian Swinford  Bom Retiro - Eduardo Camara  Arcor - Guille Atenor  Donna Francesca - Billy Mullville, G. Atenor  G. Atenor keeps a weekly list which provides the level of detail you will need for our merchant activities.  Tracee Bersani (associate) is helping out on Cuiaba I and the CAA.  G. Atenor can give you the details of Diego Holovik's activities. 
 Robin I have a conflict with this date because this is the time for the Global Finance PRC which I will need to attend. Thanks. 
 P.S.  I'd like to rear end you too. 
 Phone number at Enron is 713-646-7582  Address:  Rob Gay Enron 333 Clay Street Houston, TX 77002 
 Those dates are fine for me.  Copies of the docs will be sent your way shortly. 
 I am happy to sign but I'm not technically in the ESA chain anymore.  My understanding is that Britaldo has assumed this role.  If it will expedite things and Ben will accept my signatrure then I can sign. I don't want to step on anyone's toes. 
 Did I make you laugh? 
 Hi Chelsea,  How is it going.  I'm sure you are doing a fine job with the kids  Love  Dad 
 This is the document which controls our base equity contributions and our contingent support.  It is not the final version and is currently being turned to reflect the sponsor's comments from Friday 12/15/00 
 This is the sponsor undertakings which we commonly refer to as the Central Bank Indemnity. 
 Citibank commitment to purchase OPIC notes 
 Rick,  I understand from a statement attributed to Tony Apps that the pipeline is now delayed to May 24, 2001 from the previous April 7, 2001.  Is this your understanding as well? 
 I'm going to try and catch Chris Dutton tomorrow morning.  Regards 
 What is the date of the law referening the Furnas right to contract for=20 energy and does it apply to their ability to contract for long term capacit= y=20 without a bid? 
 Could you attempt to get Lucio to respond?  Thanks  Rob 
 Luis,  It may be important to substantiate officially Furnas' need to show 300MW available even if constrained.  Is there a way to demonstarte that from public records?  Secondly.  can you provide the technical description of the system constraints and what is involved in overcoming them.  For instance does a new transmission line have to be built or new transformer installed? How long would it take to obtain these or other items and correct the problem? 
 Sorry, I meant Lucio 
 Rob's EGF page completed. 
 Blanca What is this all about.  The timing here is really bad for all of these folks, many are on vacation 
 It's getting pricey, especially on the fee side.  But what are the options at this point. Peter informs me that we  have been limited on talking to banks which pretty much dilutes our leverage.  I also think that the person doing the negotiating has no accountability to her clients.  I think you should scream bloody murder (perhaps to the new bosses of the region) This is going to be a huge drain on the P&L. 
 Did you forget me? 
 I will be in the Global Finance PRC all day tomorrow so can you present Guille in the ESA Directors/ GM PRC? 
 Thanks for the Book. I think I will enjoy it immensely in retirement. Merry Christmas and best of luck to you in the new year and the new job.   Regards,  Rob 
 This will be fine 
 For once I remembered.   Hope you have a good one and all is going well.  It was nice to see ya'll at Christmas.  Tell Terry that Mom and Laurie loved the trunks.  I was quite happy with the A&M cardholder as well so let Jason and Erin know for me.  Too bad the Aggie lost that wild one in Shreveport (could you believe that snow).  Conrats again on your appointment to the board of the KofC.  Hope 2001 is a superb year for you.  Regards,  Rob 
 Hi Jamie,  Tried to call you today to keep in touch but the phone just rang. Hope you are enjoying Indosuez.  I have announced that I am leaving Enron at the end of February when my contract runs out.  With them getting out of international infrastructure it is time to move on.  I am going to retire for a while and see how the life of leisure suits me.   Give me a call when you have a minute (713-646-7582).  Regards,  Rob 
 I would be happy to help.  What do I need to fill out or provide?   Maggie Li @ EES   01/03/2001 04:22 PM 
 Yes, 713-345-6003  Thanks 
 Why? 
 Jose, I think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history. However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as I understand it.  The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate. Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along the lines of:  1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements?  2) Could any consequential damages be assessed?  3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras?  4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement which was payable by EPE?  Could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis?  5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage?  6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the agreements?  7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under the PPA?  9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability?  10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance protect us in any of these instances?  (Note: the US$20MM Sponsor liquidity facility provides some comfort to the lenders)   John, stop me if you think I am off track.  If you have other questions which you think need to be addressed please continue .... 
 Sorry, I've been in all day meetings Mon & Tues.  I'll get to it early tomorrow.
