 use my office on Saturday, December 9 from 9:00 AM to Noon.  My office is EB3878a and the extension is 3-6911.  Jeff Hodge 
 Janette:  This is fine with me.  Can you go ahead and do what is necessary here.  Thanks,  Jeff 
 Jenny:  Per our discussion.  Jeff 
 Attached is a memo regarding the above matter. 
 Steve:  Would it be possible for you to participate by phone?  Jeff    Steve Van Hooser 10/31/2000 10:35 AM 
 Mark:  This falls into your area.  I have spoke to William Kelly and advised that I am forwarding it to you.  Thanks,  Jeff 
 Christi and Diane:  I will also be out on vacation on Thursday and Friday, but I will be back next week.  My secretary will know how to reach me and I will be checking voice mail.  Jeff    Christi L Nicolay 12/13/2000 09:34 AM 
 Michael:  It is circulating.  I really do not have any idea as to time frame.  Jeff    Michael Slade 12/12/2000 09:48 AM 
 Clement:  Attached to the e-mail I am forwarding you will find the Enron Guaranty Agreement that was forwarded to Altrade.  Could you review the comments of Altrade and respond.  Also, I presume that Enron has provided a Guaranty to Altrade for ENA's business.  You may well wish to use that as a starting point.  Thanks,  Jeff 
 Debbie:  My first choice is March 30.  My second choice is March 29.  Thanks,  Jeff 
 Ruth:  In follow-up to our telephone  conversation,  I am confirming that it is my analysis of the purchase agreement between CES and ENA that ENA must refund to CES any transportation refunds it gets relating to the CES transportation contracts that relate to activity prior to January 1, 2000.  Likewise, if there are costs relating to such contracts prior to January 1, 2000, those are the responsibility of CES.  I hope this helps to clarify the situation.  Jeff 
 Mark:  I am not aware of any of these type contracts.  I do know that we are at times suppliers to the types of businesses listed.  Jeff    Mark E Haedicke Sent by: Janette Elbertson 04/11/2001 03:19 PM 
 Jill:  You are right.  Once this is assigned it cannot be used by ENA.  If everyone is fine with that, then there should be no issues.  Jeff    Jill T Zivley/ENRON@enronXgate 04/27/2001 10:54 AM 
 I thought it might be a some help if I distributed a red-lined version of this document prior to tomorrow's meeting.  I hope you find this of some use.  Jeff 
 Nony:  Thanks for the note.  I had caught that, but I apprecate you letting me know.  Jeff    Nony Flores 05/29/2001 06:06 PM 
 Brian:  I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:  1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial resolutions to avoid the reopener.  2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is defined anywhere else and probably needs to be.  Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to finalize this with you.  Thanks, Jeff      Brian Redmond 11/07/2000 03:07 AM 
 Jim:  I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS desk.  Jeff    James E Keller@EES 05/21/2001 07:03 PM 
 Michelle:  The approach you have outlined is fine with me.  Thanks,  Jeff    Michelle Maynard@EES 06/04/2001 04:59 PM 
 Rick:  Got your e-mail.  Glad to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  Class reunion 2002 would be 30 years.  What do you think we should do?  Jeff    "Rick Carey" <rcarey278@home.com> 06/03/2001 09:43 PM 
 Michelle:  Pursuant to our telephone conversation, I am forwarding you this e-mail.  As I advised we would like to obtain whatever information we can on a labor situation between Midwest Generation and the IBEW in the Chicago area.  Thanks,  Jeff 
 FYI 
 Mark:  Per my voice mail.  Jeff 
 Richard:  I received a delivery failure notice when I tried to forward this to you and the Susman & Godfrey lawyers.  As I do not have their e-mail addresses with me, could you forward this on to them if you think it is necessary.  Thank, Jeff 
 Sheila:  In response to your note of November 1 regarding the above referenced topic, I would like to be sure that the following are included among my reviewers:  Janet Dietrich Ed McMichael Scott Neal Phillip Allen  Thanks, Jeff 
 Here is the e-mail I was talking about.  The document in question is PSEG LOU.  Thanks, Jeff 
 Dan:  Please handle this.  Jeff 
 Attached is the proposed draft of the Initial Position for the Duke matter. Let me know what you think.  Jeff 
 Robert:  The latest draft is attached below.  I still think we should add a reference stating that defined terms are as outlined in the Agreement.  Let me know what you think.  Jeff
