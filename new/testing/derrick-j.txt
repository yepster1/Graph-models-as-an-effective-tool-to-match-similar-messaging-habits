 Walt, the East Lake proposal sounds great IF it fits into your schedule.  I plan to return to Houston either Wednesday morning or Wednesday afternoon, depending on whether we do or do not play East Lake.  Please do not reschedule any meetings you have just to enable us to play Wednesday morning-- Austusta will certainly have been excitement enough.  I am leaving Houston tomorrow morning and will not be able to check e-mail after this afternoon, so if you need to reach me drop me a voice mail at 713-853-5550. All the best.  Jim 
 Walt, Bobby and I have talked and agreed to save East Lake for another time.  I will return to Houston Wednesday morning.  I look forward to seeing you. Jim

 The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I have not.  In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key, took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had violated the sanctity of his room!  It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately.  After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual. Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  "The name is Susman, my man, Steve Susman".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of "Susman, my man, Steve Susman" would never again cross.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any other way.  I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I treasure it.  All the best,  Jim 
 Saudi, thanks, but I'll wait until you and I can play it together.  All the best.  Jim
