 Russell: I will take a look at the Guaranty and get back to you but my recollection was that the termination provisions did not make clear that the Guaranty would remain in place with respect to obligations that arose after the termination date with respect to transactions that were entered into prior to the termination date and taht was the concept that needs to be addressed.

 Molly: Here is a draft letter for Statoil.  Under the Master, they have a 1 Business Day cure period after they receive notice from us of their failure to post collateral before we can declare an event of Default.  Please call me to discuss after you have had a chance to decide what you want to do. Carol 
 Jeff: 8 would work better for me and Alicia.  We will plan on calling you then unless we here otherwise. Carol 
 Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations. This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those counterparties that we confirm.

 Wendi: It would help if in whatever you send to her today that Enron preserves its right to call for margin in the future pursuant to the terms of the agreement taht we have with them and that by cancelling the margin call we in no way waive our right to make future calls.

 Susan and Susan: Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus notes:  1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").  2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP")  We have Masters with both of these entities.   I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following will occur once it becomes effective:  1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to Oneok LP.  2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the Oneok II Master.  In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes from the parent Onoek Inc.  Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.   Carol 
 Ed: Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and the Counterparty Guaranty. Carol 
 Tanya: Thank you for suggesting the group that we talked to today.  They all seemed to be at the same level and hopefully got something out of what we said today.  I mentioned to them that you have all of the latest LC and Guaranty forms and that you would be sending those around to them.  I will work on the form of confidentiality agreement and send that to you next week.  Before I go on maternity leave, I will send down to you a binder with hard copies of all of our forms, along with the User's Guides to the ISDA and CSA.  We are still putting the finishing touches on the ISDA and CSA Schedules.  Could you also mention/remind the group that now Samantha Boyd's name should be added to all credit worksheets and Tana'a name taken off and that all day to day matters should be handled through the 2 Susan's and Samantha, as Tana is off the day to day stuff and working primarily on special projects? Thanks. Carol 
 Group: Mark has okay'ed having a going away lunch for Rod.  Looks like the week of June 26th works best for Rod.  Please e-mail Suzanne Adams by Monday of next week any days that week that do not work for you so we can pick a date. Thanks. Carol

 Paul: I have spoken with Dave Kistler about the form of CA that you sent to him. What we prefer to do is to use the form that was agreed to a year ago (a copy of which I have attached).  We can either (1) do a new CA based on this form or (2) since this CA does not expire for another year, do a side letter that provides that the term "Project" as used in this CA means both the project that is currently described and the new project that we are about to engagae in with you.  Please let me know your preference.  My number is 713-853-3989.  Carol 
 Don: You should contact Frank Davis at 713-853-7235.  He is out today but will be back on Monday. Carol 
 Leslie and Elizabeth: I should have sent this to you as well.    Could you please take a look at this form and let me know if it is okay with you?  Seems like there are more situations that are coming up where our counterparties are wanted to execute 1 Guaranty to cover all types of transactions and this is our attempt to develop a form that credit can use.   I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Russell: Just a reminder that I need to visit with you on matters relating to WPS, Equitable LLC and Global Companies LLC. CArol 
 Brant: Just a reminder that we need to discuss matters relating to Occidental (their proposed change to the MAC language) and Chautauqua Airlines.  Alos, with respect to Aquila/Utilicorp,  apparently they cannot have all of the online paperwork completed until next Tuesday.  They submitted a PA today but the guy that needs to authorize the sub-user accounts is not in the office until Tuesday.  The current plan would be for them to do that on Tuesday and then to make the switch from Aquila to Utilicorp effective next Wednesday.  I'll keep you posted but we still have not declared the Utilicorp ISDA effective. Carol 
 Please update me on where things stand.  We need to get this wrapped up before I go on maternity leave.  i'm hopeful that you are close and amybe done to 1 or 2 counterparties.  Thanks. Carol 
 Brad and John: We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification on the following points:  1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?  2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?  Carol 
 Suzanne: Marie is included.  Let's see how everyone else responds and hope that we can choose Mon, Tues or Wed.  I would prefer Mon or Tuesday because I see the doctor on Wed but let's see what works for everyone else.      Suzanne Adams 06/16/2000 05:05 PM 
 Sara: This is Greek to me.  Can you help? carol 
 Jeff: Just a few comments:  1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due to" need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.  2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it relates to the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier comment on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to Pelican .  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese explain why.  3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it say "the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.  What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

 Suzanne: Could you please follow up with janette on Monday regarding the conflicts waiver letter that I needed Mark to sign?  Thanks. Carol 
 Sara and Tana: FYI.  Please when you know it provide Suzanne with the headcount for the confirm/settlements program on May 5th and the global contracts program on May 24th and I will take care of the credit program on May 12th. Carol 
 Joya: I want to make sure that while I am out on leave that I can access my computer here.  I noticed that since Lotus Notes changed I cannot access my e-mail from my computer at home.  Would it be better for me to take a laptop home and is that possible?  Please advise. carol 
 John: Can we talk on Monday about how to deal with the LC language per my response to your e-mail?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Suzanne: Can you order me some boxes?  I want to start going through my office and figuring out what to send home when I go on leave.  thanks.  Carol 
 Stacy: I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we need to do 2 things to the existing language:  1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is "Exposure".  2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.  We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the draft that we send out.  Carol 
 Sara: I'll go with whatever you and mark think is the right thing to do but O honestly have a hrad time justifying why tana or Susan Flynn should be recognized, particularly Susan Flynn.  I would much rather take Susan B. out to lunch rather than recognize all 3. Carol 
 Susan: Per my voice mail, here is the form of Energen Guaranty.  Please use this to create the Enron Guaranty. Carol

 Jeff: While I don't quite follow how terminating the Fixed taints the Floating since we have separated the 2, I am okay with this if this is how our commercial people understand how it works. Carol    "Eldredge, Jeff" <jeldredge@velaw.com> 06/18/2000 04:05 AM 
 Patricia: Frank forwarded to em your chnages to the ETA Agreement and here is our response:  1. I would like to discuss with you your chnages to Sections 1 and 2 (a).  2. We cannot accept the chnages that were made to section 2(b).  Any confidential info that you give us will be subject to the confidentiality provisions of the ETA.  3. We cannot accept the first deletion in Section 3(a) and with respect to the remaining deletions in Section 3(a) and the deletions in Section 3(d), I just want to make sure that we both understand how this will work in the vent that you want to trade a product on the website and there is no Master in place.

 David: FYI pursuant to my voice mail. Carol 
 Joe; Per our conversation, here is the scoop on Oneok.  By the way, Sara resolved the IPE Brent issues so we don't need to talk. Carol 
 Stephanie and Frank: Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my understanding of where things stand:  1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?  2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you know when that date is.  Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions. Carol 
 Joe: Did you ever contact them about the confirms that they sent to us?  Are they now signing our confirms?  Please advise as to what, if anything, I need to be doing on this.  Thanks. Carol

 Steve: I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the only open points relate to :  1. the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think about what I e-mailed to you?  2. DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the "materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.  3. Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation procedures.  4. DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I guess we still need to discuss the :defenses" language because as I indicated to you, I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.  I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.

 Jeff: As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will be ENA. Carol 
 Mike: I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves, our credit person, and we are okay with the concept except that we would like for the ratings trigger to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a failure to have an S&P rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we put in place a CSA, that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral threshold:  BB to BB+  $2,500,000 Below BB  Zero  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our form of Credit Support Annex?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

Can we do that at 10 and can you send to us before then an updated list of your outstanding work assignments? Thanks.  Carol 
 Tanya: Thanks for your message.  All El Paso wants to put in the LC form is language that states that the original LC will accompany any draw that is made for endorsement of the drawing amount and that it will be returned to the Beneficiary unless it is fully drawn upon.   I don't see any problem with this and while it may be unnecessary, if it males them feel better to have it, i would like to keep it in.  Are you okay with this?  Carol 
 Clement: We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks. carol

 Pablo and Jose: As  a follow-up to our discussion yesterday, would you consider either weather derivatives or credit derivatives to be "securities".  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Guys: Here is where I understand Bill came out on the 6.1(a) issue that we were discussing.  ACE agreed to insert language that would carve out "publicly available" information, but with respect to all other information that would be covered by 6.1(a) and the Right of Recovery section, they would not agree to limit the Enron group.

 Pablo: Weather derivatives are derivative transactions that we do with counterparties based on temperature chnages, rainfall amounts etc.  For example, a counterparty (i.e., a ski lift operator) may want us to agree to pay them within a certain seasonal period based on  the number of days that the temperature exceeds a certain level.  With respect to credit derivatives, these are again financial transactions that we may enter into with a counterparty where we may agree to pay them if an entity taht they have a relationship with goes bankrupt.

 Russell: Here is the Equitable CA.  I have bolded the section that I am concerned about. Carol  carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Russell: Based on my review of the 6/23 draft of ISDA Schedule here are my credit questions:  1. There is no Credit Support Provider for Equitable.  Should there be?  2. What should the cross default thresholds be and who should they apply to?  3. Are you satisfied with the Additional Termination Event?    I'm assuming that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense to take "future" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset sales made during the current year?  How will we know what assets sales are made?  Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report that we receive annually?  When will this calculation be done?  Are you satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?  4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report. Is that sufficient?  When should we get it?  Alos, whose financials do you want to receive?  5. In Part 5(c) - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts due and owing between the parties and does not include "affiliates".  6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even the GP.  For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of the transfer?  It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.  In addition, are you satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?  On asset sales, I think that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 limit currently works.  Alos, I think that all of these limitations in Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional termination Events.  Please call when ready to discuss.  Carol

In the form of LC, I'm deleting the words "Rider 1" at the bottm and in the last paragrpah of page 1, chnagung the word "receipts" to "receipt".  We will generate and send to you execution sets.  With respect to the Guaranty, we would prefer that you sue the fopm which I sent to you a few weeks ago.  Here it is.  This form is our updated form and matches up with the Enron Guaarnty that we are giving you.

 Clement: Thanks for your quick response.  As for me, I've got about 3 weeks to go and after this week, pretty much anything goes.  I feel great and am really excited and anxious.  In the meantime, I'm using my pregnancy as an excuse to get our counterparties to finalize our ISDA's and it appears to be working! Thanks for asking.

 Steve: Enron's general counsel has accepted the concept that we discussed last week in the Guaranty re setoff, defenses etc.  I will try to send you a revised Guaranty shortly. Carol 
 Karen: Here is our response to your e-mail comments:  1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to those other sections.  2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.  3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).  4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?  I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.  Carol 
 Scott: Thanks.  I'll let you know when a time has been sent out.

 Teresa: As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about the maternity leave policy:  1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up at 100% pay.  2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and justifying sick leave pay at 90%  3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence, whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I still eligible?  I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my plans.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Leslie: Just 2 comments to this:  1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much as it is a relationship issue.  2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.

 Russell: Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. made  1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.  2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.  3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.  4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.  5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.  Carol 
 Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I will let you know if it is acceptable.  Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Steve: It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it separately.  Let me know what you think.

 Mary: Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.  Jeff, Stacy and Harry, Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the new form to credit.  Thanks for everyone's input.   Carol 
 HR confirmed that Stephanie is still interested and has not been hired by anyone else.  Please let me know if you feel we should contact her for purposes of indicating to her our interest in her and obtaining salary information from her.  Carol 
 Russell: Their attorney finally contacted me and we talked about the ESP rules.  She is going to do further research in light of the fact that for regulatory purposes Utilicorp, the GP, cannot furnish a Guaranty.  I alos mentioned to her that at the very least we would like to make Utilicorp a "Specified Entity" so that they would be part of the credit-related Events of Default in the ISDA Master.  As a general rule, we recommend in circumstances where the counterparty is an LP and you are relying on the GP's credit, making the GP a "Specified Entity" so that for example their bankruptcy would trigger an Event of Default.  Call me if you have any questions. carol

 Mark and David: Here is the status of research our counsel in Mexico is doing re online issues. Carol 
 Russell: There are a number of factors that determine priority, one of them being exposure amounts.  I have asked David to prepare a chart for me before I spend alot of time pursuing counterparties and that is what I am waiting for.  I would really like to have this information within the next week so that before I go on maternity leave I can at least summarize what needs to be done.  Can someone else in credit give David the Exposure information so that David can finalize the chart with the other information that I have requested?

 Tanya: Here are the credit related comments that we received from Quaker Oats' counsel:  1. They prefer Market Quotation instead of Loss.  This will obviously be a discussion point given the type of commodity that we anticipate. trading with them  2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.  3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.  4. They do not want the provisions of section 6(c) of the CSA to apply at any time.  5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to terminate and have a payment  obligation owing to us before we could draw.  6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.  7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.  Without this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,  terminate and then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.  To the extent that we were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts that they might owe us.  This is an interesting issue and one that I have not seen before.  8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.  Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?  Is this something I should try to push forward in the next week or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?  Carol 
 Jaime: Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday? Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 Robert: I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of the credit comments:  1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.  I would like to talk to you about the second paragraph.  2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than Market Quotation.  3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.  In addition. our tax people are now advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.  4. NY is okay with governing law.  5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go with our language and really didn't see much difference in what you sent other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something?  6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.  How about 5?  7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.  We can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.  Does that work for you?  8. Insert 7 is okay.   9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,  10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.  11. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit posted collateral to LC's only.  12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor?  13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A except that we need Moody's because it is used in the LC language.  14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put "either the Issuer or X" and in 1(b) include your language as an alternative?  15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).  We would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.  16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in Section 2 of the Guaranty.  17. Inserts 10, 11 and 12 are okay.  18. In Section 6(c), I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the Payment Demand procedure.  19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.  20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot agree to Insert 13.  21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.  I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of Insert 9.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will not be in the office monday or tuesday.  Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to include the following language at the end of Part 6.  Sorry for the late notice.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Mary: After reviewing heir form of Guaranty, I would prefer that we use our multi-product form.  Their form is more suited to guarantees of debt.  If they insist on using our form , I would be happy to mark it up but the mark-up would be fairly substantial.  Let me know what you want to do.  Carol

 Steve and/or Rhett: We are trying to finalize an ISDA with the above counterparty which is  a Bermuda company.  They made 1 tax comment to our Schedule.  Currently, they rep to us that Each payment received or to be received by them in connect with the Master Agreement will not be effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the US.  They want to add the following to this rep:  Each payment to be received by it in connection with the Master Agreement will be either foreign source income under the Code or portfolio interest within the meaning of Section 881(c) of the Code or gain derived from the cash settlement of an option.  Is this okay?  As my days are numbered here if there is any way that I could get some feedback on this this week that would be great so that at least I can respond to them.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Luanne: I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's.  Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Chris: I am not a power expert (Sara Shackleton in our group handles the power trades) and would feel better if Christina Yoder took a look at this.  I understand he will be back in tomorrow and I have left him a voice mail message about this.  With respect to the form of Proposal Letter, I would prefer that you use the form that I have attached.  With respect to the proposed Term Sheet, the paragraph before the "Corrections to Published Prices" paragraph refers to an Annex A which if this deal is confirmed under an ISDA would not be the correct reference.  Also,  in the disclaimer at the end, please change all references of "Williams" to "ENA."    Please call me if you have any questions.  If this cannot wait for Christian, perhaps Shari Stack could look at it.  Let me know what you want to do.

 Tana: As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my records in various stages of negotiation:  1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have been run by Dave.  2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run by Dave.  3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim.  4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March. Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.  5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave has not reviewed their comments or my response.  6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.  7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.  8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.  9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.   All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my directory under specproj/online.   Carol

 Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any comments.  Carol 
 Scott: Our commercial guys are in Philly today meeting with ACE to discuss an alternative online structure.  From what I know (which is very little at this point), because of the amount of time that it takes to implement the auction process online, our guys are looking into with ACE whether this product can be offerred pursuant the normal posting procedures that we use for most of our financial online derivative transactions.  Leslie and I are scheduled to meet with them tomorrow at Noon Houston time so if you are available and we can hook you in, let me know, otherwise one of us will catch up with you.  I would alos think that we could discuss the revised policy at that time since I don't think much will change if we go about it this way.

 Mark: I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the following in connection with my leave that you have approved:  1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.  2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence. Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.   3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should know more after next Wednesday.   Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.  Carol

 Dave: I expect to receive from our counsel in Mexico a memo addressing all of the online issues that we have asked them to address in the next day or so as I spoke with them yesterday about this.  I will need to review the memo with them and Mark Taylor to make sure that all of the issues have been adequately addressed and to determine if any changes need to be made to the documents. From my conversations with them, there don't appear to be any major issues other than the fact that we cannot offer "securities" to Mexican counterparties and they will define in the memo what products would be considered securities, but I want to see waht they put down in writing before we make any conclusions.  I or Mark will keep you posted.  Carol    David Forster@ENRON 07/06/2000 03:59 PM 
 Mark: Per my voice mail Carol 
 Jaime: when are you planning on sending this out?  I'm checking with Mark on this but I thought that we would wait until we had seen our counsel's memo before we would issue a press release or send these letters out.  Is that the plan?

 Jaime: Thanks.  I spoke with Mark and he confirmed that we should do nothing until we have received and reviewed the memo from our counsel which hopefully we will get shortly and Mark and I will get on it right away.

 Russell: Here is a summary of the ownership chain of Global Companies LLC:  1. Its members are Global Petroleum Corp. ("GPC"), YPF Distribution Company ("YPF") and Montello Oil Corporation ("Montello").  From what they sent to us, I could not tell the ownership percentages.  2. The affairs of Global are managed by a "Board of Governors" who are selected by the members.  Specifically, GPC and Montello collectively get to choose 3 board members and YPF gets to choose 3 board members.  I your credit worksheet, you had specified as a "MAC" trigger if YPF, SA fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.  Is this the same entity as YPF Distribution Company?  Do you want this as a MAC or as an Additional Event of Default or Termination Event?  Carol

 David: Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the following issue came up:  If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Alicia: I'm assuming that I will be gone when the closing sets for raptor II are sent out.  Could you please send one set to Susan Bailey, a legal assistant in our group, so we have one for the swap files?  Susan's number is 853-4737. Thanks.

 Mr. Davis: Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

I have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which then should be ready to sign.  There are some Guaranty issues that I need to take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.  Carol 
 Tana: I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.  Carol

 Zulie: I am teaching a junior achievement course to a third grade class at my son's school.  I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something akin to a "goodie bag" that they give out to kids.  Would I be eligible for this?  I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to ask.  My extension is 33989. Carol

Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000  2.

 Tanya: When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in fact this Master will be assigned to New Power? Carol

 Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder."  Let me know what you think.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Luke.Mickum@EngageEnergy.com 07/10/2000 10:47 AM

 Suzanne: Please set up a 1 hour meeting sometime next week with the following folks to talk about weather issues: me sara Lucy Ortiz Gary Taylor Seth Hurwitz   Lucy can help you pick a time that works for her group.  thanks.  carol 
 Luke: Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:  1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.  2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.  3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign.  4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.  5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following:    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Luke.Mickum@EngageEnergy.com 07/10/2000 10:47 AM

 Henry: Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we discussed, I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms and I have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6, Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form. Alos, I have made the chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity leave at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at 713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get this finalized.

 Suzanne: Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail. On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK? Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so. Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you have done.  Tell Ric I hope to see him at the club in a few weeks.

 Tanya: We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions for you:  1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.  2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?  3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?  4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?   Carol

 Ana: I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.  How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August. Sue is Charles' godmother.  Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol    Ampmstc@aol.com 07/10/00 05:18 PM

 Suzanne: Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to finish.  tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.  carol  ps - if anyone has some astros tickets for this weekend let me know as bill and arthur may want to go.

 Cindy: Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at falling asleep on his own.  How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.    Sue, How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.   Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and call or write me.  Love, Carol   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Tanya: I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to the "transfer" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee provides a satisfactory guaranty to us. Carol 
 Rod: Thanks for the info.  Our family doctor has recommended someone close by so we'll give him a try.  Hang in there on the moving details.  I know that things will settle down soon.  Things are great here.  Charles Eugene seems to be adjusting well and we are really enjoying him.  He'll be in his crib in a few weeks.  As for the swap group, yes they are thin but they appear to be hanging in there.  I spoke with Mark yesterday.  When I left, Sara was in London taking care of her mom who became very ill while ahe was over there. She is fine now and Sara is back but Mark pretty much had to handle things on his own for a few days.  He appears to have survived.  we just hired Susan Flynn's replacement so hopefully by the end of August the LA's will be back at full strength which will help out alot.  Take care and keep in touch.  You may be getting some e-mails from Mary Cook about some of my files which she has now inherited.

He is absolutely beautiful and well worth the long wait and all of the time and effort that it took to have him.  After a prolonged stay in the hospital, we are both home now and doing really well.

I haven't had anything to do with this file since I joined the swap group.  Thanks.  Everything is fine.  Still on a hectic schedule but getting a little more sleep.  We take the baby to the pediatrician on Thursday for his first checkup and I go for mine on Friday.  I've started walking again and some very, very slow jogging (don't tell Bill this).  I feel really good and everything seems to be healing okay.  I've actually cooked a few meals!  I will try to call you in the next day or two.  We've been taking the baby out on short trips in the afternoon just to get out of the house.

I miss the work routine but I'm really enjoying my time with both Charles and Arthur, and of course Bill.  I hope to be up and around in a week or so.  my recovery has been slow and steady but except for a lack of sleep, I feel great.  Hope to be running soon.  I'll be up for a visit in a few weeks.

 Mark: Thiat sounds right but I would have Leslie take a look at it.  all of this work is in connection with the deal that we inherited from Lou and it all should be allocated to whatever group Bill Windle and Gauarav Babbar are  a part of.

 Suzanne: Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift. Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.  Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.  I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it? I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet (which I know you will).  As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.  Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by for a visit.

 Tana: This should be pretty straight forward.  The only remaining issue was they needed to put in an effective date for the assignment amendment that they wanted us to sign.  The papers should be in my office.  Call me at home if you have any problems.
