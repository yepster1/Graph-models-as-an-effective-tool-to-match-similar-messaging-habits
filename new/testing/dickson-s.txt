any questions.  Stacy 
 Ellen,  Attached is the letter that we would like to have signed appointing Enline Solutions as agent for Elk River Public Utility District.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Stacy 
 Swap confirms 
 Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I will not send it to Paul until you tell me to. 
 Melba, I do not know what "any Unrestricted Algonquin Gas Transmission City Gate" means.  This description needs more detail explaining "unrestricted".  Stacy 
 Here are the confirms that Joe prepared. 
 Sara,  Here is the physical confirmation for the NUI deal.  I added an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement as an additional Triggering Event under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement. 
 Daniel,  I found a GISB between Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. and Enron North America Corp. dated  July 1, 1998 in our files.  ENA received the contract from an assignment from Columbia Energy Marketing Corporation.  Why do we need to negotiate and execute another GISB agreement?  Stacy Dickson    Daniel Garcia <Daniel.Garcia@msdw.com> 03/09/01 03:57 PM Please respond to Daniel.Garcia 
 Did you not receive this? 
 Paul,  Attached is the latest version of the Transaction Agreement which incorporates the changes that were discussed yesterday.  Please review and give me you comments.  My phone number if (713) 853-5705.  Stacy 
 Thank you for your help in chasing down the master. 
 Here is NUI's response to your latest comments. 
 Stacey,  I do not have access to that database.  Attached is the Master firm that we have negotiated.  It will be executed today or tomorrow.  Stacy      Stacey Richardson 04/05/2001 08:29 AM 
 I think this would solve a lot of our problems. 
 Mark, In the course of two conversations with Paul Chymiy, he identified 5 credit issues.  They are:  1) The Credit Agreement is for a term of 364 days so it terminates on 12/21/01.  They will enter into a new credit agreement but not on identical terms and not necessarily with the same lenders.  2) NUI Corp. does not have credit rating since the reorganization.  The credit rating should be tied to NUI Utilities.  3) The MAC should be BBB instead of BBB- for Customer.  4) NUI Utilities no longer owns the common stock of Elizabethtown and City Gas.  They are now divisions of NUI Utilities.  5)  The treasurer will not agree to (xiii) in Section 5 of the Transaction Agreement concerning additional debt.  Stacy 
 Diane,  I would wait on sending the confirms because we are currently negotiating with NUI on the provisions that Sara added.  NUI has told us that those provisions are unacceptable in the physical deal so I assume they will be unacceptable in the financial deal.  Hopefully, this issue will be resolved tomorrow.  I will let you know the outcome.  Stacy    Diane Anderson@ENRON 04/05/2001 04:48 PM 
 Brad, I spoke to Evans King today.  I will work on resolving this with him.  Should he or his client call you refer them to me.  They don't need to bother you about this.  Stacy    Brad McKay 04/09/2001 11:05 AM 
 Please review the new definition for Maximum Transaction Volume and give me your comments.  Stacy 
 Attached is the latest version of the Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Agreement reflecting Tanya's recent conversation with NUI.  Please give me your comments.  I will forward these to NUI once I have heard form each of you.  Stacy 
 As we discussed. 
 Attached is the execution version of the above-referenced agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-5705 if you have any questions.  Stacy 
 Cyndie,  Do you know who initialed this agreement?  I want to talk to him/her about this provision.    Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan@ENRON 04/06/2001 02:09 PM 
 Sara, Here is the latest transaction agreement which has my attempt to deal with the terminating credit agreement issue in item #6. 
 Tanya,  Did you have any comments to the transaction agreement that I sent yesterday?  I will send it to NUI when I hear from you.  Stacy 
 Talked to Hyvl.  This agreement is o.k. for EOL.    Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan@ENRON 04/11/2001 11:16 AM 
 Per my voice mail. 
 Per our conversation. 
 Please review the Coral Transaction Agreements and give me your comments.  Stacy 
 Gregg,  If you have not already done so, I would run this deal by credit and see what provisions they want included.  Stacy 
 Gregg,  My thoughts on Allegheny's changes to the Master are similar to Mary's.  I am generally fine with the changes except 1) I would counter with lowering the liquidated damages to 10 cents (ultimately, this is a business decision)  and 2) I would tell them that we need arbitration.  In some respects, it is more likely that disputes would arise under this type of deal so it is even more important to have arbitration. Please let me know if you want me to talk to anyone at Allegheny about their changes.  Stacy 
 Per our conversation. 
 Paul,  Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.  There was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).  I have also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for April.  Please review and give me your comments.  Stacy 
 Your brain is working correctly.  I think that we should seek out and destroy  every old Seagull contract.  If we are doing business under any of them, we need to get new cotnracts in place.  Stacy 
 Jennifer,  What a cutie!  Meg is adorable and so grown up now!  She should start talking before long if she has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching her to say Stacy.  I hope you guys are doing well.  I understand Mr Espey is not doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you guys since you are not near by.  When do you think that you will be in Houston again?  We miss you guys.  We got used to your being around last year.  Meredith is doing well.  She is starting to sit well on her own.  She still does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes her mad when she does.  She loves her exersaucer.  We went to Arkansas for Easter so Meredith had her first plane ride.  She did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal yet.  We only feed her twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that she will still be on formula when she goes to kindergarden!  I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.  Stacy 
 Sara,  Number 3 concerns the swap piece of this deal.  Stacy 
 Sounds good.  I will look for the overnight. 
 Paul,  Attached is the final version of the Master Firm Agreement which incorporates NUI's notice information and all previously discussed changes.  Also, attached is the April Transaction Confirmation Letter with the change to the addressee.  The Exhibits for the letter are the NUI Confirmations Nos. 31060 and 46669.  I understand that the changes that you requested to the swap guaranty are acceptable and that you will receive revised agreements shortly.  Please let me know if there is anything else outstanding.  Stacy 
 Stacey,  I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.  Thank you,  Stacy Dickson Granmayeh
