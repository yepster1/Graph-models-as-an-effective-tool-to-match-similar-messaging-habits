 what the scope of our plans are with PG&E.  This description will be useful to Kevin Howard as he proceeds to determine the best way to secure funds for this project.  Please send it to me and I will add the virtual capacity write up to it and forward on to Kevin.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Kevin,  We will write these up and send them to you ASAP.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Tiny,  Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.  Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?  If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.  My apologies,  Kim. 
 Bod,  Please add Jan Moore to your distribution list.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jan,  FYI, Kim. 
 Richard,  Please make sure that Paul see's the invoice.  After Paul approves it, I can sign it too.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Don't forget we have lunch scheduled tomorrow, Tuesday, February 5.  Let's meet downstairs at 11:30am.  Any preference on flavors of food?  Kim. 
 Hi Kirk,  I got your "out of the office" message the other day when I emailed you, so I knew you would be busy when you got back in the office.  My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow, my afternoon looks a little better than the morning.  Next week looks wide open.  Would you mind waiting until next week?  I just want to make sure we are not holding you up.  Let me know your preference.  By the way, how did your testimony go on Big Sandy?  Thanks, Kim. 
 opps, sorry.  I looked through the list too fast.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  FYI, I just talked with Jo and she will take a look at a 100,000 and 200,000 from Permian to TW/NNG Gray for a longer term.  She will need to look at how much capacity she will have to move to make room for us.  She (and probably Vernon) will get back to us.  I'll keep you posted on our conversations.  Kim. 
 James, thanks!  Kim. 
 Mansoor,  Here is a note from Gaylen at Questar.  We would like to have this interconnect in place by May 1.  The Interconnect Agreement is anticipated to be executed this week.  I will let you know when it is officially signed.  If it would help us meet our May 1 timeframe, please remember that Questar is more than willing to help order equipment (to our specifications) if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like .  Please let me know if you need additional information.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Hi Jeff,  Yes, this interconnect will be managed by our E&C group.  Earl Chanley will be the project coordinator.  Thanks for your quick reply.  Kim. 
 Earl,  We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.  Thanks, Kim. 
  Are you back in the office yet?  We've booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday, May 24 to Newark/Rome and returning on Sunday, June 9 from Rome to Newark/Houston.  Ticket price was $1,183 per ticket.  Paul and Judy are on board.  Can you and Tom join us?  Janell and Dennis will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to Janell's broken leg.  Please call me, let's discuss.  Thanks, Kim  X33098 
 John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.  I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!  Kim. 
 Yes, thanks.  I was aware.  I just couldn't remember if it was you or Terry.  Thanks, Kim. 
  Here it is.  K. 
 Jan,  These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago.  Are you comfortable with the difference?  Any thoughts?  No hurry, I was just wondering.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Kyle,  Sorry for not sending this yesterday.  Monday's are always tough.  Please review and let me know what you think.  Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Mansoor,  Let's discuss.  Kim. 
 Lorraine,  Would you please have a conversation with KMI about Randy's concern of KMI shutting in the Gray I/C w/o notifying us and the problems it would cause at P-3.  Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Bullets, please. 
 Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey,  Would you please email me the final bullets from last week.  I don't necessarily go look for the final copy since I am the one who combines all the bullets.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy,  Could you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?  Tiny is trying to complete his files.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey,  Here they are.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey,  As a matter of practice, would you automatically email me the final bullets document after Steve approves?  I will then save it in my word file and use it to start the next weeks bullets.  Thanks, Kim.  :>) 
 Great, Thanks!  Kim.  Shirley, please keep me posted on Krishna's new baby.  Thanks, K. 
 Jodi and Gaylen,  Please see the list below.  Would you please look at what timeframe you could get the equipment listed below.  Our preliminary investigation suggests that we may not be able to obtain the equipment quick enough to meet a May in-service date.  If your engineering department has any questions about this list, please feel free to have them call Earl Chanley at the number below.  And, of course, if you have any questions of me, please feel free to call me at (713) 853-3098.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Bill,  Please check out the changes in blue.  The changes in red are from Questar.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lynn,  I would like for you to review a draft of the proposed TW/Questar OBA in the Blanco Hub (the Interconnect Agreement is in the process of being signed and it is not built yet).  Sorry about all the "red-lines", but I think it makes it easier to see where we have made all of our changes.  FYI, the red changes are changes proposed by Questar, the blue changes are proposed by TW.  Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this agreement.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Mansoor,  I did receive the signed I/C Agreement from Questar late on Friday.  I am currently routing it for approval for TW's signature.  If putting a hold on this meter would help improve the in-service date, I would definitely recommend it.  Would you please provide me your thoughts.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Richard,  We are proceeding ahead with a new I/C with Questar up in the Blanco Hub, here is the proposed OBA that we have been working on.  Please review and let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Earl,  Thanks for the note.  Mansoor and I have talked and we would definitely like you to put a hold on this meter.  I will keep you posted on Questar's response to the list of equipment that you provided us last week as to how quickly they could receive any of this equipemnt.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jennifer,  I will be on vacation for this meeting.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jodi,  Here is another draft of the OBA.  Please review the changes I made with Gaylen and let me know your thoughts.  By the way, I did receive your signed I/C agreements on Friday afternoon.  We are routing internally for signature.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Linda, you are so welcome!  I leave for vacation Wed., but when I get back, I'll call you.  I want to see your new digs!  Have a great week!  Thanks, Kim. 
 Richard, I will be out of the office on vacation beginning Wed, Feb 13 and returning Monday, February 25.  Please include all the TW dealmakers on any updates that you may have on invoices.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Kirk,  How about talking at 10:30am CST on Friday, August 10?  My day is pretty flexible, so if another time works better for you, please let me know.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy,  Michael sent me this draft today, but I think that you should review these slides since I know that you have been working on this.  Let's discuss in the morning.  Tuesday is my last day before I leave on vacation.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Gary,  Henry did fax me some of the literature, but the quality of the fax is such that it is hard to read.  I am meeting with Jack tomorrow at 10:30, how about I stop by and see you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paul,  FYI, Kim. 
 Lorraine and Paul,  Please coordinate with each other and provide Steve an update by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) as to where your conversations stand with your customers on flipping these deals from Index to fixed rates.  He has a meeting with Stan at 2:00pm and will be asked about these I'm sure.  Also, Paul, would you please provide Steve any additional thoughts ( like we discussed yesterday) with respect to how and what things are included in our VaR.  Many thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 reg affairs can provide you a copy.   Thanks, Kim. 
 Kevin,  here is the info on the PG&E project.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hi Jodi,  I'm back in the office now.  I tried to open this document, but I do not have word perfect.  Can you convert to a Word document and resend for my files?  Many thanks, Kim 
 Jan, I believe that I do not have any memberships that fall into this category.  I'm thinking that Steve is the only one with possible memberships here.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I like it.  Kim. 
 Elizabeth,  Please read below.   Can you help us put together a summary of the TW Capacity Releases from Nov. 00 to Aug. 01?  We are in the process of putting our strategy together on our Neg. Rate hearing.  Is it possible to assemble this soon?  Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.  Many thanks, Kim. 
 Alma,  I would like to attend the March 21 at 1:30 demo.  Where?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Elizabeth, Yes I would like to discuss this with you.  My schedule for Wednesday afternoon or Thursday looks good.  How about you?  Kim. 
 Hi Robert,  Yes, I am still here!  However, the Research and Development department is no longer a part of Enron which is why their emails have been returned to you.  Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted.  Kim. 
 Hi Jo,  Yes, I do have time on Wednesday afternoon and would like to meet with you.  Might you be available anytime after 2:00pm?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Great, I'll see you at 2:00.  I am coming back in town on Wed, so if I can get back to the office by 1:30, do you want me to call you to come over early?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I didn't know you were going to Florida in July.  I will look at my schedule.  Do we know anyone in Miami?  ILY, K. 
 Steve, FYI, Kim. 
 Steve, here is the electronic version of the NNG proposal.  Kim. 
 TK,  Here is the proposal from NNG on south end transportation.  Any thoughts....particularity on the one year proposal of $0.065 plus commodity and fuel?   What do you think capacity release would cost for a one year term?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I think that would be great, however, I would like to discuss with Steve for approval on the expense.  Thanks, Kim. 
  FYI, Kim. 
 I think I gave my time to you before I left, but if not, here it is...   Discretionary Day:  February 19 Vacation:  February 20, 21, 22  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kim  :>) 
 Thanks Alma!   I would like for everyone in the TW marketing group attend this training.  Has everyone responded to you with a date to attend?   Kim. 
 Whose master firm physical gas agreement?  Does UBS have these?  Kim. 
 How about today (Thursday) at 2:00.  Can you come to EB1336?.  John, are you available, also?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I have a conference call then.  How about Friday morning or afternoon? 
 Friday at 9:00am works for me.  Where?  Kim. 
 Bullets, please! 
 Audrey,  Does this impact us?  Kim. 
 Steve,  What was the Oneok issue?  What does Ann mean by "ETS was releasing gas to Oneok"? 
 I must be sleepy this morning.  ??.   K. 
 Theresa,  I've been out of town the last couple of days, can we get together later today to discuss this?  Would you be available for lunch or right after lunch?  Thanks, Kim. 
  FYI, Kim. 
 Audrey,  Here they are.  Thanks, Kim. 
 John,  Look at this.  Kim. 
 Lindy, this looks good.  I like it.  Thanks, Kim. 
 TK,  This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time!  You should have heard me scream!  I laughed so hard I had to hang up on the Steve Cooper voice mail.  K. 
 Mansoor,  this is the other thing I was trying to remember when I was in your office this afternoon.  I would like to discuss this with you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thanks, this was exactly what I was looking for.  Kim. 
 Yes, however, I thought I saw an earlier message from you booking this meeting at 9:00.  Either time works for me.  Please confirm.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 John, sorry, I forgot to respond, they look fine.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Randy,  Mansoor and I met on this topic this morning.  We are confirming with Perry Frazier what, if any, firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station.  Also, we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them.  We will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings.  How much money is required on the Ivanhoe station to keep ESD compliant?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy, can you respond to this?  Many thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  Are you available on Wednesday to discuss the Ivanhoe station?  We want to describe to you what the situation is and get your advice on what our regulatory options are.  I'm available anytime except 9:00-10:00 and 2:00-3:00.  Mansoor, how about you?  Thanks, Kim. 
 did you get an updated tariff from Reg Affairs?  Let me know if you still need assistance.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey,  My changes are in color.  Also, I will bring over to you a list of others to add.  (I could not add rows to this spreadsheet, sorry).  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hi Kirk,  I just wanted to check in with you and see how you were doing.  How is the Big Sandy Project?  How are you doing on the water rights?  I hope all is well.  We're doing fine in Transwestern.  Kim. 
 It's official!  We are moving next week on Thursday, March, 14!  Actually, we have to be packed up by close of business on Wednesday, March 13.  Ruthann will be calling each of you to discuss your move needs, such as your type of computer equipment, whether or not you are moving your chair, etc...Boxes will be coming soon.  Please let Audrey or me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kim. 
 How about I talk with her on the phone...  We can visit with her tonight.  K. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Gaylen and Jodi,  Here is the schematic for the Blanco Hub, it has not been updated for your new interconnect yet.  Gaylen, I got your voice mail on amending the payment schedule if you guys are purchasing most of the equipment and I am OK with amending it to reflect the change in spending.  I've got a draft that I will update for the spending.  I'll send it to you soon.  By the way, do you guys have a list of the customers that will be attending your customer meeting next week?  I am scheduled for the second session.  Thanks, Kim. 
 We have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability.  The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.  They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.  I have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon.  I have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano.  I'll keep you posted.  I thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision.  If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?  I have not checked into other Rome hotels.  Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.  Please advise.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Oh, My Italian Amigos,  I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.   http://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.html  http://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htm  Please check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.  The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.  We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.  John, do you have a preference?  Paul please talk with Judy and let me know what your vote is.   Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.  Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.   Thanks, Kim.    P.S.  Paul, you'll have to give me your credit card information.  Call me with this info, do not send email.  (Due to Big E issues, I cannot delete any email messages and I don't want this info hanging around.) 
 Steve,  We are still confirming whether or not TW has had other I to I deals negotiated in the past.  So far, TK, Lorraine and Michelle don't think that we have any, but I will talk to Lindy tomorrow.  Here are some NNG I to I neg. rates that have been approved during the past year.  I will keep you posted.  Kim. 
 Stuart,  Your ears, or maybe mine, must have been burning lately.  I have been thinking about you over the past couple of days and wanted to call you and schedule lunch.  Is your new office in the Greenway Plaza area?  Gosh, we have lots to catch up on from both your side and mine.  Congratulations!  I know you must be excited and I can't wait to hear about your new opportunities with WHES!  What is you schedule the week of March 18?  Are you available for lunch anytime the week of 3/18?  Thanks,  Kim. 
 Katy,  Thanks for the list, however, I do not have word perferct and cannot open the document.  Can you convert it to a Word document and re-send?  Sorry for the trouble.  Thanks,  Kim.  :>) 
 Ben and Dennis,  We do indeed appreciate being able to use the 3907 conference room for our morning meetings.  Thank you for moving your standing Wednesday staff meetings to another meeting room.  We look forward to being on the same floor with everyone!  See you Thursday on EB39!  Kim.  :>) 
 My Italian Amigos,  I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.  Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?  Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.  Please advise.  Thanks, Kim.    P.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8! 
 Please send me your bullets ASAP this morning.  If you have no bullets to report, please reply to me that you have none.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey, here they are! 
 Steve,  I just ran into Tracy in the hall and she asked if on Trans Pecos the $131MM (or it could be $138MM) represented 100% or 50% of the cost.  The $131 is 100% of the cost of the project.  If we joint venture with KMI, our cost would be half of this.  Call me if you have questions.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I will be out of town next Friday.  Lorraine will be attending for our group.  Thank you for the invite.  Kim. 
 Ruth, would you please invite Lindy Donoho also.  Thanks, Kim. 
 yes. 
 By the way, I don't think I finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today.  Yes, you are correct that PNR revenue was only $1,200 in July.  Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month.  TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR's.  The Daily Balancing Report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yes, I called Steve Harris from the airport.  What is the amount?  I was not sure from the numbers below.  Please save the detail from my expense account.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy,  We are meeting on Tues at 10:00 in 1336 to discuss how TW may handle a storage point on our system with respect to how we contract for this point (given that contracts will want to receive and deliver to this point on a firm basis) as well as how we schedule gas at this point.  Will you be able to attend and give us your advise?  Many thanks, Kim. 
 We are sending them over this morning.  I have already talked to Dave Matney and told him the agreements were coming this morning.  They will review and we will plan to meet next Mon or Tues to iron out any remaining items (such as the operatorship) so we can tender to Pemex.  Stan is OK with them and has agreed that if we need to conceded the operatorship, we can, but he would like an opener in three years to re-bid the operatorship. 
 Steve, FYI, Kim. 
 Earl and Mansoor,  I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect.  Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also.  Please confirm that you have what you need.  I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed.  Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.  Earl, I believe Mark McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago.  I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay.  Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?  Does anyone else need to see it?  Please advise.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Dennis,  I am travelling Wednesday and will not be able to attend.  I am asking Lorraine to attend in my place.  Thanks, Kim.   Lorraine,  Will you be able to attend this meeting?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey, I have no off duty time to report.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Mark, let's discuss this and get with Kevin.  Thanks, Kim. 
 pretty cute. 
 Earl,  Will you be able to coordinate with Agave to do this?  Have you talked to Paul Ragsdale yet?  FYI, I had Audrey send my copy of the as-built drawing to you last week.  If this is a duplicate from what Agave sent you, would you please forward the copy I sent you to Mansoor for his files.  Let me know if I need to talk to Agave.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lou--while you were on the lake...  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hattie,  Yes, I will fax it to you when I get home tonight.  In fact, when you get it, why don't you call me and we can talk about it.  This is one of the recipes that I got in Paris when I went to cooking school.  They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks.  I hope I'm not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe.  My home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098.  Thanks, Kim.   :>) 
 TK,  When you get back from vacation, let's talk about this.  What do I need to do?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I received a message that there will be a surprise lunch for Rich Jolly on Friday, March 29 from 11:30 to 1:00pm in ECN46C1.  Rich is retiring after 35 years of service.  Everyone is invited.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Tiny,  I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.  Good luck on Bisti!  Thanks, Kim. 
 Tiny,  Thanks for the note.  I'll let TK and Mark know that you got the money for the four wheeler.  Along with many, we will miss Rich a lot.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Cindy,  This works fine for me.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  I will plan to attend this meeting.  Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 It may be a good idea for everyone to attend this meeting to get brought up to speed on the 637 filing.  See you there.  Kim. 
 Martha,  I'm sorry you had to miss lunch today.  Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS).  Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains.  He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call.  His office number is 713 739-6715  (if 739 doesn't work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy).  His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct).  Please give him a call.  He is very happy in his new role.  My lunch with him today did remind me of the "good ole days" you and I had with him.  Give me a shout when you get back into the office.   Thanks, Kim   P.S.  We moved up to 39 last weekend.  I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41.  Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk.  (Sorry.......)  Call me. 
 L--- Can you help with this?  Per my conversation with you earlier today.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I was really thinking about the prep work needed for Sat evening.  Can we talk tonight?  What watering hole?  Where?  K. 
 Dear Gary and Fran,  Attached, please find a resignation letter from both me and Lorraine Lindberg.  If you would like a signed hard copy, just let me know, I would be happy to provide it to you.  Lorraine has also indicated that she would provide you a signed hard copy, too.  At your convience, I would like to visit with each of you.  Sincerely,  Kim. 
 Steve, Tiny sent me this note when he heard the news.  K. 
 Hattie,  This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.  Good Luck!  Kim. 
 Sherry,  Thank you so much for your kind thoughts.  I sure have enjoyed working with everyone.  I will miss all the great personalities that we have assembled in ETS!  And, you can definitely count on me for being at The Nutcracker!  Thanks again, Kim  :>) 
 Audrey, here they are.   Thanks, Kim. 
 Shelley,  Congratulations!  TW has a great marketing department and I know that you will enjoy working with everyone.  Can we schedule lunch next week?  I would love to visit with you and share with you some of the things we have been working on to ensure a smooth transition.  I am available on Monday, Wednesday or Friday.  Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Great.  I'll put 11:30 on my calendar.  Kim. 
 Audrey, =20 Please reflect this change for John Cogan on the customer/phone/email list.= =20 =20 Thanks, Kim. =20 
 FYI, Kim. 
 L--  More unsubscribed capacity reporting....  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thanks, Sue.  Actually, today is my last day in the office.  I will start with KMI (doing Business Development)  in a couple of weeks.  I've got your phone number, I'll call you when I know mine and we'll set something up for later this month.  I hope all is well with Dynegy.  Thanks again,  Kim.

 potiential bullet material.  K. 
 Mark, I reviewed my files and did not find the Dandby section.  I don't believe that I looked in the asset book.  Check with Jim Curry - there did seem to be some confusion about the Asset Listing Summary vs. the Asset Listing Detail (that wasn't in the file)  - maybe it is just miss-filed in their stuff.  Kim. 
 Lindy, I did not see you on this distribution list.  FYI, Kim. 
 Cameron,  I'm glad you found the bulletin board.  The units are in MMBtu/d, the month should be specified by the column.  Thanks,  Kim Watson 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Glen,  Can you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?  Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?  Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?  Many thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 FYI, Lee accepted our invitation to the Nutcracker for Wed. evening.  Kim. 
 Dear Hattie and Jim,  Thank you so much for hosting our dinner group Saturday night.  Your home is just lovely and we particularly enjoyed the beautiful china!  It is so nice to share stimulating conversation and great food with wonderful friends.  Thank you again for your hospitality! See you next week.  Kim and John. 
 Lindy, would you like for me to send Michelle to this meeting?  Should you both go?  Let me know what your preference is.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Steve,  Was Lorraine able to get you an answer before she left?  I know she had a few calls into Nevada Power.  Let me know if you need me to do anything on this in her absence.  Kim. 
 Kevin,  What was the offer price from KMI on the Sonoran Pipeline Project?  Kim.

 I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K. 
 If I can't swing Friday, how about planning on being there at 9:00am? 
 Opps, I have my gyn appt on Wed at 2:40 and 3:30.  Can we meet with him on Tues? 
 Dennis,  Thank you for your kind note.  It is amazing how our pets become so much a part of our lives.  John has talked me into going to the cat show which happens to be in town this weekend.  Of course, we will pay special attention to the Turkish Angora breed.  Thanks for your thoughts.  K. 
 I've got it booked.  HAGD, BCDTA, ILY, K. 
 TK,  What are your thoughts on resolving this?  Would it help for you to talk to Pauline?  How can we assist Darrell in this?  Thanks, Kim.

 Please keep me posted.  I am off next week, but I would like to book lunch = with you in the next couple of weeks just to catch up.  Twenty-six floors i= s too far away from you guys.  What does your calendar look like.  Throw me= a couple of dates that may work for you.  Thanks, K.=20

If we miss this meeting, may we to= uch base with you by phone to get any pertinent info on TW.  Also, we want = a recap on any stories or jokes that you tell!  :>).  Many thanks,=20 Kim. 
 It is that time of year.... Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November.  Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14.  Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.  As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.  Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.  I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items.    :>)  Thanks, Kim. 
 Mark,  This looks fine.  Kim. 
 Paula, I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.  Thanks, Kim.  P.S.  Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!  I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well! 
 I will be on vacation this day, however, I am planning on coming in for the board meeting in the evening.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jan, FYI, Kim. 
 Hi Phyllis!  I am so excited to get to see you this weekend!  I sure hope all is well with you.  It looks like you and I have been assigned the dinner for Saturday evening.  I am open to ideas for recipes!  Let me know when would be a good time to visit on our assignment.  I will make time for you anytime.  Thanks, Kim.  :>)  phone:  	work 713 853 3098 home 713 791 9201 
 Mary Kay,  What is the usual process on something like this?  Do we get a chance to respond to the protest before the FERC makes a decision on whether to hold a Tech Conf?  What is the timeline for any other protests to come in?  What is the timeline for FERC to decide?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Drew,  If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW t= hen take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible= for the difference? This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity = in different packages of time.   KW. 
 Sorry, I had a typo in your address below. Here is the message.  K. 
 Jerry,=20 Was there anything for TW that came out of this meeting that we need to be = aware of?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I can be available at 6:30 also.  John is on his way back from Austin and I'm not sure of his timing, but I am certainly game.  Let me know where and when you would like for me to meet you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey and Steve,  FYI, I have an eye appointment on Thursday at 4:00pm.  I will leave about 3:30.  I will have my cell phone if anyone needs me.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paula, Can I catch a ride with you?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yes.  I'll be there.  K. 
 Jan,=20 What impact does this change have on our earnings? =20  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 No off-duty time for me on this report.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hey Kevin,  Thanks for the message.  In fact, I talked with Glenn Hass about this earlier today.  I also talked to Questar about this today as well.  Gary Schmitt was somewhat optimistic, but he had not seen the full order yet so he was still reserved.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Michelle,  Would you have time to handle this I/C?  If so, please let Perry know that you are the marketing contact.  If not, please let me know so that I can pass it on to someone else.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paula,  Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for Jim, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.  Some of the names we mentioned last night were:  Bill Tarter Lenore Fenberg Muffin Alfred  Any other names that come to mind?  .....Will Eucker, Art, Tammi Semi, Carolyn Brown, Ken O'Neill... are other people who have been involved in various efforts.  Your thoughts?  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI....  I believe Dave N. and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. I've got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, James has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow. The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations? We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy, FYI, I have a call into Tiny to discuss this picture and the ownership of the pipe in question.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Thanks for setting this meeting up.  K. 
 Audrey, here they are....

 Lindy, thanks for looking into this.  I agree with your comments.  Kim. 
 Hi Dot.  Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see what she says.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.
