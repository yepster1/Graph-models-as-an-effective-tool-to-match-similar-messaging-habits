2001 to meet her goals and is on her way to making it the first quarter as well.  I think she is really beginning to understand her business.  Anyway, I currently have lots of time to myself since we are not trading, so maybe we can have lunch sometime.  If that is not possible, no big deal, I know that you are extremely busy.  I hope all is well with you and your family.  Sincerely,  Bert 
 Bill:  Please note the following due to the past two days schedules have been wrong in the EPE Schedules in Excel:  Tag number 6181 has been cancelled (50mw to the CISO).  Lending is wrong in the EPE schedules (it is 75mw from PSCO instead of 50mw).  SPS is wrong for HE 08 (it is 130mw instead of 100mw).  I thought you might like to since this is the only income we have currently for real-time and a major screw-up could hurt our relationship.  Regards,  Bert Meyers
