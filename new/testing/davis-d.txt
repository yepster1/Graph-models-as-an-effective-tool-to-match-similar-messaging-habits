 You are right.  I did misunderstand.  Sounds great to me and just for my information, what day and time is your group fasting?

 Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee cause if you go, I GO!  Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last Wednesday.  "DON'T QUOTE ME" Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut off  Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll see you tonight at choir rehearsal.  dd

 WhaTeverrr! 
 Nothin' Honey! 
 Have a wonderful day.  I'm gone to the Cadillac Bar for our Christmas Luncheon. 
 I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.  I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them. 
 Morning - Would you mind terribly, taking a few minutes to jot down a brief set of directions to our retreat in Galveston please, sweetie, little kitty?  Thank you!  DD 
 If you're not busy, I'll come in and check for you if you'de like. 
 Thanks!  I will be placing it on the calendar.  Do you have the icon on your Lotus Notes workspace desktop?  It's the  "Merchant Finance on ECTHOU_..." icon.

Let me know what you think.  Lots of Love for my sister in Christ.  Dana

 HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok. I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  Hebrews 4:12 - For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to the swift, neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my sisters!  Love You,  Dana 
 Call me NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111     Lola Willis @ ENRON 10/03/2000 11:44 AM

 An application called AP Data Viewer.  Accounts payable uses it to retrieve status on document such as invoice payments, wires, payment requests, etc....  I've just spoken to Pam and I think I'm requesting the right thing but using the wrong form.  Will you please reject this so I can start all over?  Thanks Dana
