 Dawne,  The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Please check our books.  Thanks,  Errol 
 These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these companies.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Looks good.  Errol 
 Please see the attached new book request for the NG-Price book.  John Arnold is now trading crude on EOL and they are booking to NG-Price.  Of course, we have to have this today.    Thank you,  Errol 
 BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.  Thanks, Errol    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  In the Position folder.  I saved a file called 'GammaFile'.  The worksheet we looked at is called "calculator".  The password is: price.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Dawn,  John Arnold is now hitting the crude oil stacks.  Currently the deals are booking to NG-Price.  Attached is a completed new book request form with the short name for his new crude book - NG-Price-Crude.  We are changing the deals to the new book today, but we need them to start booking automatically tomorrow, if possible.  We can discuss in the meeting at 4 pm.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Please change these to BT.    Enron North America Corp.

 Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Durch,  It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.  Errol

 Irena,  The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we won't have as many space issues in the future.  I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Jeremy,  John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid our position might not be correct as well.  Please give me a call.

 Sue,  I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Dawne,  I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good.  QV0345 booked as a June deal instead of May 01.  The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration. If I'm not mistaken, the swaps should be NX1.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Thanks

 I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these problems can be fixed before the morning.  The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.  Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,  Errol L. McLaughlin

 Frank,  I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.

 Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.  See you soon,  E.L.M.

 How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.  Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm so sorry!).  Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.  ELM

 Please speak with Jason Wolfe regarding this file.  It is for the West desk. I am sorry, from the original sheet you showed me I thought it was ours.  I have forwarded your request to him.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  I just saw you call.  John Arnold is on my phone so I couldn't pick up.  How does Thursday sound for a meeting.  I am available all day until 2:30. Friday is also good for me.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  Friday at 10 am is great.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin
