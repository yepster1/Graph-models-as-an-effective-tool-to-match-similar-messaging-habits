 Dave,  it would be great if you guys could fix the EOL listen file before the start of cash trading (approx. one week from now). It is a lot of help and I don't know how am I gonna trade without it. :(  thanks  Vladi.

 Franky, you are THE KING!!!  thank you very much 
   You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been said that "True love is just around the corner"...and maybe... if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will.  In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without. You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem.  You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past...and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment..  Whatever you strive to do, something always seems to be holding you back. There is no subterfuge in you. You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life, in a relationship, is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can, together, develop a foundation of trust based on understanding. You are your own person... and you demand freedom of thought ...to follow your own convictions. You have no interest in "two-timing" and all you seek is sincerity and "straight-dealing".  You wish to be left in peace... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ... In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... All you want is for "them" to get on with it - and to leave you alone.. 
 John,  sorry for not sending it to you earlier (totally forgot to open my outlook). Raw data is on the fisrt tab of the file to the right.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Vladi. 
 Constance,  I was on vacation from October 4th to October 19th and I didn't submit my timesheet yet. I tried to do it on the HRonline web-site, but the procedure is too complicated. Is it possible that you or somebody else in the HR department mark the vacation time? I would really appreciate that.  Thank you.  Vladi Pimenov  ext. 37625 
 We're in!!!! 
 Alejandra, there is no attachment 
 Alejandra, that's definetely shouldn't be in my book.  Great catch!!! 
 Chris,  the pipeline maps I found are worth looking at. They don't cost much ($950 for paper version and $795 for CD rom version) for both US and Canada. I think that CD-ROM version is a better bet: you can zoom in and out and you can print the parts you need. The real value is that they show every interconnect with every facility (power plants, industrials, even prisons:).  I think that it is something that would help us look into details when we approach different regions, and I think basis traders would appreciate it too.  Sample map of Montana is attached.  Vladi 
 Kimberly,  count me in
