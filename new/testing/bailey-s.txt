urnished such language to Mark Tawney for his comments.  I do not believe that Mark has responded.  However, CRRC is willing to address this later under an amendment to the master.  Therefore, as you can see they are rather eager to sign a master with ENA and they are willing to address some of their issues at a later date.   Let me know your thoughts.   Regards, Susan S.
