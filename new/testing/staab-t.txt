k Citation should be good now.  Try and re-draft and let me know.  I'm working on your other emails next.  I'll take them one at a time.  Amy will no longer be here so I will be the only one working on this.  Talk to you soon. 
 I liked your flag.  I forwarded to a bunch of people and we all have it on our computers here.  That calendar was enough to put me on a diet.  Yuck.  You'll have to forward that home for dad to see.

 Robert, I'm working on this right now.  What do you show as the storage schedule?  I have 2 different ones.  I know you changed it.  I just want to make sure we're both on the same schedule.  I'll just make sure my volumes on storage match with the schedule and then I can send them all to you. Thanks,  Theresa 
 Ruth,  The market drove us back for the weekend.  Have a good weekend.  Theresa 
 Thanks Laurie. We have this on our "To Do" list but we just haven't gotten to it yet.  I will add this to the folder and let you know when we get into it.  Theresa 
 Chris, I left you a voice mail also, but I wanted to let you know I do know about these transactions.  Please give me a call. Thanks Theresa (303) 575-6485 
 Try this one now and let me know. Thanks. 
 Hello All,  The final payment of 1,937200 is in Sitara on Ticket #1087272.  I understand we will draft this for September and Jim Pond will re-classify since we've already manually paid.  Let me know if you see any problems with this.  Thanks. Theresa (303) 575-6485 
 I'll give him 10.00.  Thanks.  (You could have had a free lunch on us).  Theresa  I hope he liked it. 
 I haven't seen it yet.  I know he's working on it.  As soon as I get it - I'll forward it to you.  Theresa 
 The team mate says were not interested at this point.  But thank you for the offer. 
 I didn't mean to get you so bent out of shape.  I'll bug Holloway and let you know what he says.  I do have to wait until Nicole calls me back to see who she wants to trade for.  If she calls me yet today, I'll let you know. 
 Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no reason.  We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush us.  We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.  And by the way - where's our $60????? 
 Let me consult my partner and get back with you in the morning. 
 What's your idea? 
 FYI  Lisa Finley just called me to let me know that Devon Operators need to take Beaver Creek down tomorrow for 8 hours.  They apologize for the short notice, but said if they don't fix the cooler now it will bring the whole system down soon.  We will be short by about 6,500 on the 005 contract for Gas Day 4 and I guess we'll have to work at paying it back.   That's all I have to say .....about that.  Theresa 
 Kelly, I'm gonna be early this week.(for once)  I'll take Dallas as my loser this week.  Talk to you later. Theresa 
 Can you try this again? Thanks. 
 Bob, I'll take Oakland as my winner this week.  I gave Lucci my $20.  Theresa Staab 
 Ruth, I'll send this spreadsheet as I update it.  Talk to you soon. (I'm set up to come next Thursday with the boys).  Theresa 
 Bob, I'll pick San Diego as my winner. Where do I send a check to ? and what address?  Theresa Staab 
  Valerie,  FYI - from Robert Poole at Greeley Gas.  Robert: Maybe we can get together later this week to see if we can figure out the difference for August.  Let me know.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Try it again and let me know. 
 Valerie, Are you still having trouble with this?  I may need you to fax it to me so I can see it.  Call me because I think I'll have to use a different fax number and I'll need to get that for you.
