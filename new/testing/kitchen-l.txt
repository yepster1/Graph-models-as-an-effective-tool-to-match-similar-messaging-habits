 I'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.  I would hope for a major change in format. 
 Just what I needed! 
  Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.   There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.  Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John 
 I think the job may still be open next year. 
 We are going to ask Kim's group to help pull information for credit (public domaine information) in order to help accelerate the credit process as his group is heavily stretched at the moment.

 John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together. I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999. Louise -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld

 Yes - cancel Power origination  Yes - cancel them going forward - John doesn't need them either at the moment 
 Can you invite Breslau and LaGrasta and Luce, 
 How are these items progressing? 
 Hello  Glad you got yourself sorted with a new job.  Things here are getting better - we have nearly closed with UBS, so I hope to have a new job next week.  Still in Houston.  Are you trading - if so what?  Take care  Louise 
 Don't tell me - did you tell his nibs - it's his issue 
 We're getting them back believe it or not!!!  They are ours again.  So its ok.  We got the merchant business back a week, we don't even know who made that decision but its our again. 
 When people request an understanding of gas or power - does this mean you ask people from ENA to give tours or speak or something?  Is there any role we play in hosting the event? 
 This one is searching through expoense reports.  I have no interest.  Can you guys do this for John please. 
 That is awful.  Poor little kid.  Do they think it was just another child? 
 Hard times - but we're all behind you.  Keep going.

 Heads Up, I spoke to Jonathon this evening.  I confirmed that Dynegy had been speaking to Eric Shaw at length.  I think the only reason Jonathan got the job was that he asked for less money. Speak soon L 
 Zippy trades under Arnold's but if you report to John and Michael you need V@R

 I would be - it was an email with Scott on my lap.  John's conversation with you today is what I am talking about.  If so - I have a hole, do I not in Portland.  So I know this chap MS who won't move to Portland but its worht you talking to him.  Should you decide to pursue John's conversation further.  Let's talk tomorrow.  Lousie 
 nope 
 Scott just sent you the message before I'd finished.  So I have a real long shot for you to talk to at some point. Matthew Scrimshaw - I don't think he'll move to Portland but he might.   So an ideas yourself? 
 well - what do you think of that!  I have someone who is a suplong  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 no  - only if specified is my understanding, although on flat panels they are now trying. 
 No problem - the issue is I can never find you on the Address Book, because of the C.  Louise 
 yup 
 Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.  We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities? We need names etc.  Split the list into areas  Industrials in our SIC codes  Utilities  Munis  Thanks 
 Can't wait to see you.  I think its a good choice. 
 Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.  Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.  As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.  As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.  Thanks  Louise 
 I am trying to fiind out that date I became a member of the IOD and secondly if I still am.  Please could you let me know as soon as possible.  Thanks  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Ok - I butt out.  EBS  only has a handful left now and with redundancies over there they are trying real hard to place their people. 
 MAke sure we get at least 15% reduction.  Thanks  Louise 
 Do these match ours? 
 I think we need to include groups with MPR where is was originated this year. 
 is in town?  Are you seeing him - if so are you taking anyone from power? 
 No concerns. We managed to get about $40mm reduction the IT development budget, you are picking up some of the reduced budget (See Lloyd Will's email of earlier today).  Let Lloyd know if you have any problems as we are getting fairly close to sign off.  Thanks  Louise 
 Just so you know 
 done 
 He's 5 months, 19lbs and not rolling over!  90th percentile for weight, 50th height, 50th head circumference.  doesn't sound like it will be long before you have another one! 
 How's Nadine and baby by the way? 
 Fine  - how are you?  Baby not turning over yet because he's big!!!  Lots of people falling out of EBS aren't there. 
 OK 
 Power trading or Origination spring to mind.  Power Trading is interviewing Tim tomorrow, do you want me to set something up for you too.  Forster is  running one of the power origination groups, give hime a ring. 
 Looks like we are making outstanding progress.  This is great news. 
 Here's a little issue.  We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?  Thanks  Louise 
 Dynegy to run Orig - in Europe working for Cardone. 
 Do you really have someone as capable as Marcello.  This is an outstanding trader who we probably have no chance of getting but could run any desk we have.  Is your SE guy of that quality? 
 Today was the last date I discussed with Piper.  Before 4pm. 
 As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.  I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.  Thanks  Louise 
 Before Matt left he deposited a confidentiality agreement on my  desk which dates back to August 6,  2001.  Jaime has it now.  What do you want me to do with it?  Sign it? 
 There are a lot of people who are not Enron Americas - please cut them out? 
  Expenditure verification  You have purchased some new computer screens - any particular reason when we all get in the new building? 
 Did you hear about  Jonathan?  Louise Kitchen 
 Please tell them - that I am cancelling due to the Budget process. 
 Brian Redmond or Jean Mrha will need to approve the budget as your number will be charged directly to them.  Brian or Jean please co-ordinate your response through Faith Killen. 
 Please could you do the following;  Cancel today 3pm	Barry Tycholiz 4pm	Weekly power meeting  Tomorrow 3pm	Lagrasta 4pm 	Frank Vickers  Friday 10am  	Brian Redmond 4pm	Brad Richter  Thanks  Louise 
 Just in case you didn't know yet 
 OK 
 Great photos is that all that's left of EBS's people in London - how many did you have a one point? 
 This is great - two please 
 If you have an issue you need to ring Eric Gonzales.  He shouldn't have had the meeting - there is a lack of integrity on this. 
 we only covered commercial. 
 great - two please 
 I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.  Contact IT if they haven't contacted you.  Steve Harrington or Jenny Rub. 
 We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.  Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):  0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals) > 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid) Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000 Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes) Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes) Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.) On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)  Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.  Let the games begin!  Louise 
 I don't just mean the logon I mean the domaine name too, once you are in EnronOnline you need to stay on www.enrononline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxx.

 Thanks 
 Did Howard attend - if so how's he looking? 
 Thanks - I have used it already to Tim.  I mentioned the Beth concept - I'll let you know what he says.  Jeff Richter is too busy  - he runs EES in the West.  Keep thinking though I like the idea of Jeff or Barry. 
 I think we are moving towards this concept. Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES responsibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte.  On the commercial side, I am thinking Beth.    I have had preliminary discussions with Beth and Mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements.  If you have a problem with this - let me know.  I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.  I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.  Its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it.  On the operations side, I have asked Sally to take a large portion of the IT development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance.  Sounds like we are thinking the same thing and we have made some progress towards this goal.  Louise 
 Joe Deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate - the ones that really stand out to me are Kelly Boots and Glisan.  Joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology.  Louise     . 
 I am also meeting with Robert on your contract - so we should get that done today.  Thanks 
 Great news 
 Can't remember whether I thanked you for this - if not - thanks for your prompt response.

 Nope 
 I think we are missing - Generation investments and Mitch Robinson's group. 
 It doesn't look like you were asked to do anything - just notifying you. No is the answer though.  Thanks  Louise

 Cris  Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.  We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high.  Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.

 Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.  I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.  Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list. 
   I see what you mean. 
 I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.  Our differences are: Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin  I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.  Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey?  I added to your file schoolyard.  Speak to you later.

 Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;  (i) Correct, and (ii) Correctly allocated  Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.

 Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Where's the answer 
 Marcello is getting very frustrated.  Only Matthew is talking to him (all second hand). 
 Please register  Talk to Liz/Nicki to see if they want you to attend to help - only if you want to 
 I need a description of each of these assets asap - no more than one sentance on each.  Before 9:15am if possible on email so I can pick it up on Blackberry.  Thanks  Louise 
 So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.  I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.  I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress. 
 Please do 
 ATS is not new origination and shows through the MPR.  All the rest were too small.  Louise 
 great news 
 Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.  In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way. 
 We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:  Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power Lloyd Will for East Power Geof Storey for Gas Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada. Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.  Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.  I am assuming its zero at the moment.   Thanks  Louise 
  Woops  Another coming in 5 minutes. 
 Thanks 
  diary 
 Seems we missed a circulation - this wasn't the last one circulated on Friday.  I will send you the final one at 12. 
 Duran to run it 
 Not prizes for that title. 
 George,  We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?  Louise 
 Been there, done that.  This doesn't allow us to you have to be based in London!!! 
 I do need to alter one slide and also I am keen to see the financial slide whenever it is done.  Hope you had a good week-end. 
 If you pursue the overtime issue, coul dyou please let me know.  Thanks  Hope you had a good wek-end. 
 Hello - hope you had a good week-end.  Two things - PIPs are still not done and I still have never had my pay reconciled.  Thanks  Louise 
 Hello Pat,  We would like you to price:  Chairs (2) The chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.  SOFA The sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).  PILLOWS 3 square additional pillows (2 in chair material and 1 in sofa material).  Would the wood be the same in the sofa as used on the chairs?  Please could you let me know the prices.  Thanks  Louise Nettelton 
 When is that lunch with the Board we got invited to?  What time are John & I presenting at the Board?  Why do I have meetings on Wed - I thought Chicago was Wednesday? 
 I am hope I haven't just refused this for no reason but if my diary is right - Marcus is away. 
 I can't do these dates.  I will be on my way back from Chicago (Peoples meeting).  Sorry  Louise 
 Not entirely sure - John requested this on Friday I 'll check 
 WAHEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 When is it - I can't miss that if its the budget meeting?  It appears to be every day.  I am a bit worried now about next week - I appear to have some real scheduling difficulties. 
 When is it as Marcus is away on Thursday - I presume Chicago is Wed and obviously I can't do Philadephia as Marcus is away.  I presume you know all this - am I looking at the wrong week - is Chicago next week? 
 Could you put together  a list of all the Enron Corp employees who have Enron (non-Dell) equipment at home. 
 You have two problems  (i) Unwind of interest rate swap ($2.3mm) (ii) Mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap. (approximately ($9mm) is not offset)  Louise 
 and the current slides you have on display I'll then do the updates to our slides and correct the errors.  Thanks

 No reason I can see 
 I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way.  I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise. 
 OK 
 Like to me with you today. 
 Duran has to okay it 
 At least she will not keep quiet. 
 Amita is now free 
 I think I have your replacement for Savita. 
 Was down $10mm in Q3 - did you know? 
 Hope you saw the funny side and it cheered you up! 
 Yes 
 One pc - 3 screens  Thanks 
 Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names. 
  Thanks - appreciated 
 We'll guarantee a minimum of $200,000 for 2002 based on current price of $25,000 per data room.  We will not agree to an allocation though.  Thanks  Louise 
  See photo http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=list.jhtml&list_frag=list_5columns_powerwomen.jhtml&list=22&_requestid=8742 
 We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp.  Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.  As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).  We are all over this one but progress is slow.  If you want more details - let us know. 
 ok 
 Itss crap - almost all of our own websites.  I've read it - probably have a copy somewhere if you want it. 
 "What happened to this guy? 
 Thanks 
 is speaking to Mike McConnell today 
 Where are we with www.enrononline.com? 
 No fine thanks 
 I really want it in Q4 - not Q3 
 Yes and Yes 
 Broadcast voicemail - sounded good! 
 Cheers Big Ears 
 Surreal experience really.  I was hoping no-one noticed.  PR did it and as you can imagine - without asking. 
 I rang Jeff - he's out 
 Funny though isn't it! 
 Ha bloody ha 
 No absolutely not 
 Can you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately  (at their cost as it is late) whatever they can of the order. 
 Hideous isn't it - I'm 9 months pregnant in it. 
 I'm planning to go see Greg with Wes for 10 minutes on Friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets.  (IT budget for this year is $735mm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I'm still working on this one obviously) 
 Trying to keep it quiet too - sems to be working - Lavo didn't even see it 
 Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.  But definitely put a list together.  Thanks 
 I can't tomorrow - how about next time she is in town.  Or in New York? 
 Give her 13 
 I'm ok 
 Both interruptible and firm.  Thanks

 Wellhead Desk  Can you please send Jean a list of the 9 people. 
 yes 
 0Knew as usual nothing about this until it was too late. Enron nominated 5 people.  I'm trying to keep it quiet. 
 me 
 Geoff  This cannot be right - its millions I thought we were about $5mm all in including the secret Zhei project 
 I'm still here too 
  Great thanks 
 Just a quick question  - 23 years for PGT? 
 I concur with your view .  No to all of them  Louise 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh - never mind - haven't they heard of a fax?  It'll happen 
 nearly time to go 
 Let's try and keep this quiet. 
 We passed each other .  This answers all my questions  Thanks 
 Just to check have you ever done anything other than gas and zinc.  If so, when and how much? 
  Don't worry orig is what I wanted 
 Thanks very much - perfect. 
 Funny. 
 I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.  Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.  Issues:  Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident? I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.  Thanks  Louise 
 Need to include Saguoro 
 Not for Canada -- for the US 
 thanks - I await the next update 
 P&L 
 Haha - definitely not! 
 Hideous photo - couldn't we have given them a better one! 
 Let's hope no-one else notices.  Let's make sure no-one does anything internally so people notice it.  Thanks 
 Obviously it is not what we want - we are assuming Anthony has power Beth has gas. 
 Why is the CA dated August 6th - have we been sitting on it since then? 
  Is it written yet? 
 Forgot Saguoro (sold it last week) 
 but here is where we got to. 
 and mtm 
 Can you please email me a list of the development sites we have sold this year, what our basis was and what p7l we expect of have from each site.  Please include Onondaga and Doyle, AES site etc.  I need it asap.  Thanks  Louise 
 We still have toadstools/mushrooms and holwa in need of new turf on the lawn.  Any news?

 Hello again  There is a gentleman here at work looking for a place for 10 in Beaver Creek.  The website (Sales) has disappeared , so I can't show him the pictures - do you have another set  of the pictures you could email me as I might have another customer for you.  Thanks  Louise 
 I am assuming that's it for this trip.  Please confirm there is nothing else like a restaurant reservatio or something?

 None exists today. 
 Maybe running Mexico replacing Max Yzaguirre - but it really comes down to cost. 
 Joe Deffner but what about the credit implications? 
 Can we have all PIPS signed and on my desk by end of play tomorrow.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Great news - it'll be great for you 
 So did you move to Rebecca's job? 
 Just got your message.  Give me a ring to discuss. Its a great idea - I am thinking Power origination but let me know if you'd prefer gas.   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 How good I am at responding - suffice to say I have stuck in budget meetings for the entire week.  Have you gone yet?  Are you free for lunch? 
 They report into Greg Curran a VP who works for Eric Gonzales in EGM.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Yup 
 Tammy  Can you add these 5 temp slots on 5  Thanks 
 Are you working on the new Contracts? 
  Ted,  The people included in the cc: are those people we nominate to interview on the below mentioned days.  We have not checked their availability and should you not find enough people from the list above please revert to John or I, but I think you have enough.  Louise 
 It worked 
 Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.  John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward. 
 Thanks very much.  Louise 
 You won - it was a convincing argument 
 Could you fill in all the other assets  Thanks 
 What about the actual small video tape in the video camera? 
 Mr Haedicke instructed destruction of the videos.  As we couldn't tell which was which - they all went.  I would assume Calgary has a copy.
