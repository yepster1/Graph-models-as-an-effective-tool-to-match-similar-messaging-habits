 Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks. 
 Glen  I should have included you on the distribution list. Sorry. 
 Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated.  I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated.  We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks. 
 At one point, we considered using a bill management agreement for Consolidated Container. I worked on this with Erin Stus. We came up with a draft that I was fairly happy with and it should be the latest draft under my Consolidated Container file on the j drive. If you can't find it there, give Erin a call. She should still have a copy.

 Keith,  =09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new c= ompressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service= within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existin= g units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months = after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o= ut of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we sh= ould be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragr= aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi= ce within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar= deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we= would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., c= ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and place= d into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operat= ing compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't= do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension fo= r the abandonment.=20  =09

 Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks. 
 What's a good time for everyone? I'm open in the morning. 
 Thanks. 
 Attached is a revised draft of the letter. The only change from the prior draft is to the volumes in the first sentence of the second paragraph. I've changed the contracted capacity figure from 120,000 Mcf to 106,700 per feedback from Keith. I think this is now ready to file, except that we will need to fill in the blanks. Please confirm this and give me a call at your convenience so that we can discuss the logistics of the filing. Thanks. 
 Attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the CPUC regarding the AL2837 proceeding in which SoCal Gas is proposing changes to its "windowing" criteria. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks. 
 Your comments look fine. Let's wait and see if anyone else has any comments. 
 Attached is a revised version of TW's response to the CPUC's protest. This version reflects comments received from Teb, Mary Kay, Greg and Maria. I apologize that the attachment is not red-lined. I'm having computer problems and have not been able to generate a red-lined version that accurately tracks the changes.

 Here's a revised draft of the letter to the CPUC re SoCal Gas' "windowing" proposal. This incorporates the comments of Lindy and Terry and also some editorial changes. We need to file this tomorrow, so I would appreciate receiving any comments by 10 a.m. tomorrow. Thanks. 
  FYI. 
 A revised red-lined draft is attached reflecting some additional comments from Greg. If this looks ok, please let me know and we'll finalize and file it today. 
 I'm the original owner. I got it shortly after I came to this department. It's a Compaq Armada M700. 
 Ann,  Attached is the final, ready-to-file Answer of Transwestern Pipeline Company to Protests. I believe we have confirmed that this can be filed electronically today. If this is not the case, please let Steve and me know so that we can have it filed manually. Also, will we receive any confirmation of receipt of the electronic filing from FERC? Thanks. 
 Attached is the final version of Transwestern's advice comments, which has been submitted to the CPUC. 
 Linda,  This looks fine. I just want to confirm that we do not countersign this transportation service request when we receive it from the potential shipper. Instead, we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution. When we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper, we countersign it and begin service. Is this correct? 
 Mark,  This looks fine. 
 Yes, although it's no big deal to leave it in.
