.   In addition, you can leave messages with the hotel voice mail (I am staying at Ritz Carlton on Key Biscayne).  I will also be checking e-mail at least once per day. 
 Ron Green is the President of FPL Energy and Mark Maisto is the President of FPL Energy Trading (sub of FPL Energy).   I have Mark's contact info at home.   Send me an e-mail at kmpresto@hotmail.com and I can reply at home with his contact info.  You would be a great fit for their shop. 
 My candidates are already through their rotations and are essentially finished with what we have defined as the trading track. 
 Highly Confidential 
 500k right now.  I am prepared to pay a $1 million development fee as well. 
 Agreed.   Thanks. 
 FYI - Can you help Ron sort through these issues.   With OPPD's cooperation, we can easily overcome these issues and make May 02 in-service for 150 MW of rented diesel generation installed at OPPD distribution substations. 
 No development is easy.   I see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome.   Please develop a plan to have a 150 MW on-line my May 02 with rented diesel equipment.   We would install the diesels at OPPD distribution substations.   We may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result.  Last year Com-Ed and IPL completed an installation with CATs in 3 months.   The key is to get OPPD to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses.  Please work with Terri and Ed.   If you need any additional info after working through a plan with Terri and Ed, please let me know. 
 No, I have sent 3 copies to Lavo. 
 I received them.   Thanks. 
 Thanks for the hard copies.   Can you please send me an e-mail with an electronic copy. 
 Please call me when you get in to discuss hole in SE.  thanks.  Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 I forgot to mention that today's curves will be down another 5%, therefore, the prices in the spreadsheet are too high. 
 I'm not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail.   As always, all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger.   As a rule of thumb, prices are good for about 15 minutes.  Therefore, let's be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 5-10% on some days.   For example, summer power is down $20.00/Mwh over the past week and June is down $10/Mwh.   Summer 02 and summer 03 are down $7-8/Mwh over the past 3 days.  Thanks. 
 I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   David worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.  In addition to Green Mountain, David has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions (San Antonio, misc. QSE contracts, etc.) 
 Tuesday April 17th. 
 I will do the interview.   Please schedule with my asst. (TJ Black at 3-5800) 
 Let's discuss this at our 3:00 pm meeting today.   Please put on agenda.  Thanks. 
 No electronic copy - Evelyn saved a hard copy.    The quote was related to Enron's activity with TVA. 
 Joe is set to rotate to real-time MW on June 1 and Bill Rust is taking his scheduling place.   I have no problem with Joe going with you.   With respect to Narsima, timing may be an issue (transition), however, I should be able to make that happen as well.  With Busby, Bernie, Joe and Narsima (timing an issue), you have some competent support at the outset   In addition, there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline.  Hopefully, the dust settles and the transition can start next Monday.   We also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions. 
 The genco room needs to be with power and the size needs to be increased as requested by Lloyd Will. 
 Ryan is waffling.  I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.   These weather guys need physcology treatement.   Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.   I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.  Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.   With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this. 
 A written summary is fine. 
 I need a summary on this issue.  Thanks. 
 Can I get the interview package (including resume)  Thanks. 
 Doug Gilbert-Smith, fletch sturm, rogers herndon, rob benson, and mark dana davis. 
 What is their proposal? 
 What is this? 
 Please print and put in binder for me (4 tabs for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).  Thanks. 
 FYI - Another opportunity for mid-market to extract value from the market. 
 Are you OK with this? 
 test 
 I gave you his resume 3 months ago.   I am sending another copy upstairs today.   He would be a manager level hire.   No, he is not the ex-metals trader.  I would like to hire this guy ASAP. 
 Can you send me another copy of the pros/cons matrix and the function descriptions.  Thanks. 
 As I told John this morning, we have similar issues with Var in the East.   The correlations between gas & power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month.  I have requested changes to the Var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon. 
 The first report looked good, however, I would like to see the owner name, and technical configuration.   In addition, I would like pictures of each facility. 
 I tore the Agreement up because he would not sign it. 
 Willis is an Manager candidate 
 No I'm not OK with this.   We have never paid in the past.   Is it different if we request 02 only? 
 I vote No. 1.   I think the necessary synergies between gas and power marketing in TX can be accomplished at you and Milly's level. 
 When do the guys that signed contracts get the paperwork for option grants and restricted stock?   They are all asking me. 
 Change the request to 150 MW per period.  Thanks. 
 We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).  This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP. 
 Thanks Pearce. 
 Org chart for today's meeting. 
 Right now. 
 I had to leave early yesterday so I am just getting around to reviewing.   Looks good.   I will call with any comments.  Thanks Tim. 
 FYI. 
 Thanks for your contact list.   Enron also looks forward to working with Oneok.  Attached is a list of individuals (with titles) within our trading organization whom you will be interacting with.   Please call me with any questions. 
 I don't have this finalized yet until final personnel decisions are done. 
 I have your list and will be sending you an e-mail shortly.  Thanks. 
 FYI - Org. Chart.   Do you want me to have my asst. replicate for the West? 
 They need to talk with Ed Baughman to define a deal structure. 
 Please make sure that all visitors maintain a considerable distance from the trading floor.  Thanks. 
 Make sure we keep all visitors at a considerable distance from the trading floor. 
 Yes attend. 
 Please follow-up.   Thanks 
 Thanks for the update.  I also talked to John and he expressed the same doubt. 
 Rogers and I have our weekly trader's roundtable meeting, so we are not available for the tour. 
 Congrats Janice and good look with your new job. 
  Please put on calender and remind all desk heads to invite people who have signed up.   This includes you, Tina, and Claudia. 
 FYI - Please follow-up. 
 I would recommend sitting with the real-time traders (they trade, reserve transmission and schedule the power in real-time).   You can coordinate with me. 
 John Dorbone (sp?).   You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site.   They have 4 custom builders (Tom Bailey, Pine Oak, Country Village, and Tom Hale).   They recently fired Coventry and Frederick Harris.  I have not made a decision yet, but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative.   It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house. 
 Please schedule a meeting with TJ Black (3-5800) 
 Please handle.  Thanks 
 Approved 
 I talked to Julie Havilend about Paine Webber keeping my on-line portfolio manager updated with all of my Enron options.   Entering options is tricky and I was hoping you can provide that service for me.  Let me know. 
 Myself and all of my desk heads will be interviewing candidates Wednesday from 1:00 to 5:00 pm. 
 Quarterly. 
 Come see me tommorow morning. 
 Rogers can be reached by e-mail at drherndon@aol.com.  He would like updates on activities everyday if possible. Thanks. 
 I need approval for this ERCOT Schedule C.   The e-mail from Stacey outlines the details.  Thanks. 
 Keep it up.  Our markets are getting even tighter. 
 Deny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification. 
 Because we have lost several people to retail risk management (Rogers Herndon, Narsima Misra, Jim Homco, etc.) and John Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly, I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets.  Therefore, all tours during trading hours (6:30 am to 3:30 pm) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel.  Sorry, but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes. 
 Looks great. 
 Green Mountain prudency has been approved by Lavo. 
 Yes we are aware.   thanks. 
 Edison International purchased all of Com-Ed's gas and coal plants approx. 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-Ed through 2004.  The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found.   I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback. 
 I don't agree with either 7 or 8.   The 0.1 LOLP generally results in 20-25% reserve margins which are excessive.   Reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance.  My view is that ICAP should be eliminated completely and, if utilized, transitional only for a 1-2 year period.   The other alternative is the ISO to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an ISO for meeting reliability reserve reqs. 
 Please put Steve Marland's Cell number in my Address Book. 
 Several names in my Lotus Address Book that did not transfer to the new Outlook platform.   The names that did not transfer have text next to them.   For exampe, Todd Rice did not transfer and his name on Lotus Notes has "Office Number" next to it.  There are several other examples of this.  thanks. 
 Send to Lloyd Will for his review.  Thanks. 
 Doesn't OATI already do this? 
 I would like a consolidated report on all generation projects monitored to date.   My recollection was we had identified approx. 50-75 projects to monitor.  thanks. 
 How come you never show EOL #'s for East Power.   I would like to see East Power included in the e-mail report.  thanks. 
 Looks great.  Thanks. 
 I have not hired a replacement yet.  No meeting required until I find a replacement.  Thanks. 
 please put on my calender. 
 All fixed price locations (ERCOT, Ent, Cin, TVA, SOCO, Com-Ed, PJM, NEPOOL, etc.).   The biggest Cal positions are Cin, Ent, PJM, and NEPOOL. 
 The highlights I would focus on are:  1) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 (compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000) 2) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD (compared to 100 in 2000).   In the last two weeks, EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500. 3) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market. 4) Positive P&L in every Eastern region 5) Outstanding return on VAR. 
 thanks Vince.   I read about this in MW Daily and on Bloomberg.   I think it will be a good project. 
 Will do.  Thanks. 
 Please put on my calender and create interview package. 
 Wow. 
 Let's bring him in for an interview.   Have Johnny Palmer set up. 
 Filing looks good.  My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.  If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.  Other thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.    I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.    In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center. 
 Agreed. 
 As soon as I get access to crude, resid, & coal curves, I will grant access to power curves.  Thanks. 
 Looks fine. 
 Please have Grace (or her replacement begin including NYMEX coal, PRB 8800 Coal, Resid 1% and Resid 3% in the curve handout everyday.  Thanks. 
 Please provide power curve access to Jen Fraser in EGM. 
 Please place on drive that the traders can access. 
 Good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift - much appreciated.  The family is great - Caitlin just turned 3 and Dane is now 4 months old.  I hope Fran and the kids are doing great - how's your new addition?   We will be going to Miami Sept 13-16 (Miami revenge on Washington) and hopefully we can hook up for a beer.  As far as the guy from Citizens - we really don't know that much about him.   Where is Tony Altman - under a bus somewhere? 
 Portfolio looks good.   Is it valuing options properly?   Can you rename the portfolio "Enron"  Thanks. 
 I am trying to change name to "Presto - Enron" and it won't let me.   How do I change name? 
 Please grant Steve access 
 Thanks 
 I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.  I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.  I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.  Does everyone agree? 
 The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is valued OK, but the options are not.  In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio. 
 It would help me if the grant dates were listed in the Portfolio details.   This will help me determine if we are missing anything.  Thanks. 
 Did you get my message on option valuation in the portfolio? 
 Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.   The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value.  I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate. 
 Thanks. 
 I think you forgot the cash postion.  I would rather have on-line valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.   I like to look at my personal equity portfolio (includes Enron hedging) separate from Enron granted stock and option value.  One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently. 
 I already signed something on this.  Unless I hear otherwise, I am going to ignore this e-mail. 
 Thanks. 
 We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.   Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.  I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.  In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).   This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.   We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.  thanks. 
 750k is BS.   Ron has only been working on this for 3-4 weeks.   He has made one trip to Nebraska.   I expect more like 50-100k in costs incurred.   This is precisely why I told Ron to work directly with Terri on this project.  With respect to Ameren, Ron should work directly with me and Lloyd Will.  thanks. 
 Fine with me if Hunter and Lavo can support it. 
 It needs to look like our wholesale reports (postions shown behind each utility).   In addition, peak and off-peak should be on separate pages.   We should have two views:  1) By utility 2) By counterparty 
 Are you a mind reader.   I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm (EB641) to go through East Positions (wholesale & T&D) and discuss process, deal review, big risk items, new deals, etc.  In attendance will be:  Berney Busby Don Black Rogers Herndon Jay Lewis Joe Wagner Narsima Misra Jubran Whalan  I recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon).   I will assume Kim will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location. 
 Calender. 
 Make sure TJ puts on my calender. 
 Wednesday doesn't work for me. 
 OK.  I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday. 
 Not yet. 
 Please respond to request below.  Thanks. 
 I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.   This is pretty easy math for me.  I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.   I would like to get this done ASAP.  Thanks. 
 Are we going to attend? 
 Thanks. 
 Please adjust calender. Thanks. 
 thanks for the invite, but I won't be able to make it. 
 Do you have a list of people for the special trip?   What do you think?  Cabo Courdelane (sp?) Vegas  We need to get the list of names to aviation ASAP. 
 I would support 90 MW at Homestead. 
 Could you take a crack at a draft for the Skilling/Lay presentation.   The presentation should focus on supply/demand (97-02), RTO progess in each region, and the progression of heat rate curves (expanded last year and compressing this year), pricing history, volatility graphs, etc.  Thanks. 
 I agree.   We don't know the base value of the current deal, so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring. 
 Mine.  Looks good.   We should get one suite as well that we can use as a beer drinking hospitality room.   I'll confirm dates with you later today or tommorow.  thanks. 
 Please put together package.   What is this interview for? 
 Thanks Rogers.   I think Steve would fit in with our group well.   I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues.    My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable. 
 Rika, This is fine.   However, the Genco related info should be screened. 
 I understand and agree with everything, except 8% was the agreed upon interest rate as noted on the economic runs which establised the demand payment between my book and New Albany, LLC.   It is clear that 8% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 9% to 8%. 
 Please make a recommendation that keeps this individual.   I have given my views, and they are falling on deaf ears.   Please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 75-80k.   This seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult. 
 Calpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their c= ompany hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts.   Calp= ine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged= effectively in the non-CA locations. =20 Given these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particul= ary with the legal concerns they also have.   I would place a low probabili= ty on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at D= ighton, particularly with the legal issues. 
 Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.  I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions. 
 I think so.   To top things off, there building downtown flooded and the tr= aders are working out of there house.   They have no idea what there positi= ons are, and they are trading almost exclusively on EOL from their home com= puters. =20 What a joke, huh. 
 Please work with Stacey and Donny Vinson to credit New Albany LLC with the 492k. 
 I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.  I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:  1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required) 2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time) 3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm. 4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday 5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)  Let me know if this works for you guys. 
 Carson is done and I just talked with Suarez.   I told John he needs to make his decision based on the economics in his package.   150/150 is a great package for Suarez.   I would be uncomfortable increasing based on other areas where we may be short.    Good news on Craw. 
 Didn't we already hang Richter with this at the Monday mtg.   By the way, Lavo has indicated he will just attend our Monday meetings every couple of weeks instead of having a separate meeting. 
 No, I won't be using. 
 You caught that.  I guess that's fair.   We would likely leave around 1:00 pm CPT which would put us in Portland at 2:30 (West time).  Does this work? 
 We need to send someone.  Thanks. 
 You are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set= up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should= be:  =091) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition= , risk systems, deal capture system, status of =09projects, schedule, etc.) =092) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff, = and gas) =093) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East ta= riffs) =094) Bernie presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal va= luation, new model construction) =095) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio= valuation - works with Richter) =096) You and I find the holes and provide direction.  Your thoughts? =09 
 Sounds OK for now.   Long term, your portfolio manager should know how to value options. 
 The following people will be making the trip:  Portland			Houston Tim Belden			Kevin Presto Mike Swerbzin			Fletch Sturm Bob Badeer			Dana Davis Jeff Richter			Rob Benson Tom Alonzo			Rogers Herndon Matt Motley			Don Black Mark Fisher John Zufferli  Could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and Tim Belden.   We may have to arrange for Don Black and Rogers Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon.   Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let Rogers and Don know.  Thanks. 
 50k.   Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.  We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.  Are you guys in?   We will have a blast. 
 I understand.   If I have too, I will dip into my money.   I think the requests are reasonable and fair with respect to individual's peer group. 
 You will probably be glad you didn't go.   If the boys are in jail in Mexico, you may have to run the desk the next week. 
 Rogers can't attend due to family conflict, therefore, you will be on the corporate jet.   You should be getting a copy of the flight schedule from Kim Hillis via e-mail. 
 Please make sure the meetings I need to attend are on my calender.  thanks. 
 No chance.  He gets nothing other than the pricing model through structuring. 
 Means broken and needs fixed - like your Mercedes. 
 I bet your insurance is a 3 times higher than Calgary. 
 Could I please get an updated valuation summary on the sale of New Albany.   Do not include the $10 million capacity unwind in the economics.  I want only the MTM effects (the accrual benefits are gravy).  Thanks. 
 done. 
 Your welcome. 
 He was under Ed Baughman until approx. 1 month ago.   He is now the Entergy/SOCO scheduler. 
 Below are contacts if you need help over the weekend with new docs, employee questions, etc. Amy Fitzpatrick   Cell:  713-859-6266 Jeanie Sloan   Cell:  713-553-7049  I need to know by noon on Sunday who is in and who is not.   For people not committing, try to get there contracts back so we can re-allocate $'s as necessary.   All contracts signed by Sunday at noon will get a $2500 check from me personally.   I encourage all of you to contribute to the fund to entice early signing.  If you need new docs printed, please contact Amy or Jeanie at above #'s or call me.  Harry - You and your guys situation is different, therefore, ignore the Sunday issue.

 The way you set up the portfolio is very confusing.   Why not have two portfolios:  1) Enron - Restricted (all stock with a $0 basis in this portfolio - should be $400k+) 2) Enron - Options (all ENE stock options - gain/loss column will show intrinsic value)  Thanks. 
 After setting up the portfolio, please customize the view to show the most relevant data.  Thanks. 
 Yes, I think we should make a formal break.   We have separate accountability for retail gen (wholesale plus ancillaries), and I think reg gen plus T&D should have separate accountability as well. 
 We have made great returns on the front of the curve and the back of the curve.   We have significant Cal 02 through Cal 05 positions, that have provided solid profitability.  It is completely inaccurate to say we have made all of our money on the front of the curve. 
 In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.  It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.   Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.  The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.  Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly. 
 I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.   Can you check into this problem.  I want the view for both portfolios to be:		Open Date Quantity Purchase Price Last Price Cost Basis Market Value Gain/Loss Gain/Loss%  Can you make this the default view setting.  thanks. 
 You got it.  I'm learning.   I hope this translates in P instead of L. 
 Thanks. 
 The $5 million is strictly an internal trading #, and is irrelevant from an acct. standpoint.   We can ignore it for the DASH. 
 Do I need to attend.  If so, please put on my calender. 
 Remove. 
 Calender. 
 Approved. 
 You have the latitude to put your key people under contract.   Edith was very clear when I talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers. 
 I concur.   You know we are likely selling New Albany this week and I am assuming ENA's premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset. 
 Your kidding right?   What's the term?   Remember, I only agreed to the terms for 2001 only. 
 With respect to the flight to Ft. Lauderdale on 9/13, can you see if Steve or Continental can improve our row 25 seats to a bulkhead row for both the outgoing and return flights.   Let me know.  Thanks. 
 Agreed. 
 This was not clear and the only thing I agreed to was a premium for 2001. 
 You got it.  I will be in Cabo this weekend with Wolfe's boss (tim belden - my counterpart in the West) and I will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing. 
 EPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP (Installed Capability) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo.   The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation (Paul Posoli and Kevin Presto) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit.  The parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language, at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 I support this.   This wan an oversight on our part. 
 You didn't attach anything. 
 Joe will get promoted at year-end.   Associates are not eligible until 18 months of service.   We placed Joe in Superior. 
 Has East Power recognized the 750k refund? 
 Yes, I am very busy today.   I will get back with you tommorow or Friday. 
 I'm not doing this interview.   I told Dave Duran we have no interest, and I'm not going to waste my time on this individual. 
 Short and sweet.   I like it.   You will have to sell your competitiveness and work ethic, because you bring zero experience and your resume reflects that. 
 I will talk with Belden this weekend and I'll get back with you on next step. 
 Can you show me on an Ameren transmission map exactly where this project is. 
 Greg works for Enron North America Wholesale Services (he is Vice President in West Power over hourly trading, middle marketing, and services business).  You got em. 
 Please call Bill Rust  x33801 reg TVA Jan/Feb Transmission when you get a chance.  Thanks Tjae 
 Below are the assumptions agreed for booking the New Albany spread option:  EPMI East Power Book pays New Albany a fixed demand charge for the next 5 years as follows:  2001 $4.72/k/mo 2002 $4.63/kw/mo 2003 $4.54/kw/mo 2004 $4.45/kw/mo 2005 $4.36/kw/mo  As consideration for the demand charge, EPMI has the right to "toll" gas through the facility and receive power in return at a fixed heat rate conversion factor of 12.5 MMBtu/Mwh.   In addition EPMI will pay New Albany $1000 per start (for maintenance reserve fund) and $1.00/Mwh for variable operating costs.  The New Albany, LLC will receive an 8% return on capital.   Book value will be depreciated from $409/kW basis on 1/1/2001 to $336/kW on 12/31/2005.  The facility output assumption is 360 MW with a 95% availability in the summer and 75% availability in the winter.  Jenny - Please revise the booking of New Albany in Rogers book effective tonight. 
 Could you please come check Kevin Presto TV....he thinks the cable is out of it. Thanks Tjae 
 You can set up the Tv's now per Fletch thanks again,,,,Tjae 
 Below are the EPMI proposed bid/offer spreads for EES.   These are very aggressive markets given the liquidity issues and regulatory uncertainty that still exist in the Eastern Interconnect.   There are no other counterparties in the market that will consistently make the proposed 2-ways. 
 The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives:  Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on this project. Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.   If Ben elects to continue to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon. Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton restructuring project.   If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself.    The value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team.  Chris - Do you agree with the above description? 
 New Albany will accept proposal assuming my deductible is limited to $1 million per occurence and my BI deductible is limited to 30 days and includes full replacement revenue (less marginal fuel costs) after the 30 day period.
