them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka.  A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, but you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap.  A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.  A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares bankruptcy.  AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship them.

  Hey homes.. Got a message from who I thought was you and hoopties last weekend.. Hooptie left message that you and him wanted to talk to me? anyways returned the call but did not hear from you homies..  Anyways.. I had an extended vacation in Brazil due to the terrorist attacks,  we ended up staying there for a week and half.  Let me know how things are going.  PT 
 Dave,  I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that you can give us the same information that the course would while you are here?  Please let me know.  Thanks,  Paul D. Thomas Enron Wholesale Services East Power Trading (713) 853-0403 
 Dave, Willis Philip and I are scheduled to arrive in Albany around 2:45 PM on Oct. 15.  That should give us time to meet you there by 4 pm, however, if we should be delayed I will give you a call.  I appreciate you taking time to show us around your facilities.  Furthermore, we can all meet together when you come on the 22nd.  That should enable us to cover all the issues without redundancy.  I will talk to with Juan to firm up the exact meeting hours so that we can have an agenda for the day.  Paul 
 Willis, I let them know that we will be there unless we are delayed.  PT 
 Casey, I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.  I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.  Your final showed $341,000.  Please give me a call.  Paul 3-0403 
 Willis Philip and I are scheduled to attend the Oct 16 class.  Paul 3-0403 
 I do not think it was a price revision, hence I would like to see all the deals from the last half of the month.  I think some deals might have entered into the system incorrectly.  I will contact Warrick to see what deals he shows in the system.  Paul

 showers ending early in the morning, cloudy into the mid morning timeframe with high pressure sliding in behind the frontal boundary as the day moves on.  Winds will become northerly and northeasterly throughout the day gusty at times as well should clear out late in the afternoon....temps will be fairly low and below normal should be a high of like 72 or so on Saturday  It is supposed to rain on Friday and I have updated our weathermans comments..  I think that Sat is fine.  Love ME  What are we going to eat?  Cajatero!

 Virtual Bidding Questions  1)	How is uplift allocated when there is thunderstorm alert in NYC?  Is the uplift allocated to those short going into the real time in Zone J/K only or is it allocated statewide? 2)	When is uplift allocated statewide as opposed to superzone? 3)	Are credit amounts going to be adjusted and when?  Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure.  Thanks Tom 
 I do not see anything... it is just a link to the chronicle.... 
 yes I am... just want you to know that I love you very much! :) 
 How is my bunda doing?  LOve ME
