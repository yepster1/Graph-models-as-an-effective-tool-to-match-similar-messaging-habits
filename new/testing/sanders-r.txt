 My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.

 Any thoughts on this question? 
 Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help. 
 I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business contact--a short and sweet letter should do.    Dale Rasmussen 01/04/2001 03:11 PM 
 Based on this information, I say don't go. Let me know if anything changes.

 One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million.

 He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that case. He never told me that he would be filing anything.

 On February 14, 2000, Enron North America (Enron) filed a declaratory judgment action against the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Chattanooga Division, requesting that the court determine whether TVA defaulted under its power purchase agreement with Enron by failing to pay undisputed invoices.  On March 6, TVA filed a counterclaim against Enron alleging that Enron wrongfully terminated the power purchase agreement.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 How about around lunchtime?  Seriously,12 is good. Where?    Kje451@aol.com 02/21/2001 11:04 PM 
 Gary---I think you should write the PX a letter asking:1) where this $ went, 2) whether the Core performance bond has been paid and where that $ went,3) whether the State has paid them any $ for the block forward positions, 4) has a claim been made on the CTS performance bond and is it still active given the State's action, 5)How did they calculate the $17mm chargeback they sent us, 6)what other $ has been collected to minimize the chargebacks If anyone has anything else they think we should ask the PX please send Gary and me a note.

 Are we sure this is an investment and not the name of their earnings strategy 
 I would involve Michelle Cash or someone in Enron Corp who deals with labor/employment issues. I am surprised this issue has not come up before.    Peter Keohane 02/27/2001 06:06 PM 
 I told Sandy that this looked fine to me but I am not a trasactional lawyer. I just want to make sure you know the obvious: Intratex has the Beeson case attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise separate this company from Mother Enron. 
 I am scheduled to be in London next week.  I would like to sit down and talk to you about this.    T Paul Johnson@ENRON 02/20/2001 03:08 AM 
 As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help. 
 May I please have a flat screen? 
 I have called TVA's in house counsel to determine how the press learned about 
 It is really not the record retention policy that drives this decision, it is the open subpoena from the CPUC and the fact that we have been sued. Gary Fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature.    Tim Belden 03/02/2001 09:38 AM

 Unfortunately, I will not be coming after all (it looks like we have it covered w/Jim,Robin Gibbs, and Mary Nell) However, I would like to sit down with you at some point and discuss Europe's litigation management strategy. Hope all is well.    Mark Evans 03/02/2001 11:54 AM 
 Please send this to Mark Manela by e-mail. Mark--- thanks for the gift but as I indicated in my voicemail to you last week, Enron's policy forbids me to accept this gift. Thanks again. 
 I dont understand your message.Squires is the Judge. Susan Myres is the opposing counsel    "Radack, Judge Sherry (DCA)" <Radack@DCA.CO.HARRIS.TX.US> 05/22/2000 07:39 AM 
 We have been sued in Cleveland. Do you know any good commercial litigators? Boutiques are fine. 
 Robin or Jeff----Please call me after this conf. call and let me kow whether there are any developmments. 
 please let Ann K./ Barbara G. know about this case 
 richard.b.sanders@enron.com 
 Ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000. If only he knew how hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron. Although I did not talk to him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any offer. Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press on. 
 If we are ever going to pursue this lawsuit, we should do it soon. Where do the traders stand on pricing/ MTM exposure? 
 Attached is the letter that legal believes should be sent to Venoco.  Please let me kow if you hav eny changes, otherwise please send this letter to Venoco by Friday.  As we have discussed, you may want to call Venoco to let them know this letter is coming. 
 Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky. 
 That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is it going?    Gail Brownfeld/ENRON@enronXgate 03/07/2001 03:06 PM

 fyi 
 What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your and Gary's thoughts.    "Harry Olivar" <hao@quinnemanuel.com> 02/16/2001 08:38 PM

 I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville. I have just left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the document. Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of course you can always call Kevin. I am on spring Break but am checking messages. My cell no. is 713-410-6128.    showard@agsk.com 03/07/2001 06:47 PM

 Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to coordinate that much, at least yet. Key Corp refused to wave conflict for several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of it.
