 H.L. Jacobson ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company  Further to our discussion Friday, concerning certain confirmations for ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company, I have determined the following: first, ExxonMobil  or HPL may confirm transactions as agreed at the time of the trade; second, in the event HPL confirms,  we have made changes to our system which should prevent the  issuance of  GTCs for Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing Company trades, with the exception of "online" trades, therefore causing future trades relating to these agreements to attach to one of two contracts under discussion  Friday.   Please bear in mind these changes may not be in effect until the end of next week.  With regards to confidentiality language contained in the confirm, we are unable to amend this at this time.  Finally, concerning the August 8th letter (confirmation) provided by you in the meeting, we are in agreement with same.  We trust the foregoing meets with your approval.

 In response to your memo, concerning Article 11,   I have increased El Paso's threshold to $10,000,000; Article 17.13 "further acts" and "deeds"  means any further action that would need to be taken by either or both parties shall be done, i.e. new taxes or tariffs etc.  This article gives assurances to both parties that each will honor the necessary changes as required in the course of normal business.  In addition, I  have changed the date to October 1, 2000.  If this is satisfactory, I will send execution documents for signing.  Please review the attached, and let me know.

 In response to your e-mail of 4/12 regarding Hall Energy,   do NOT cancel the GTC's without discussing same with the trader or business person for the midwest. The original agreement (Hall  #96003960) contains very specific pricing from that well for long term use.    I suspect the GTS were put into place for alternative pricing or business reasons.  Nevertheless this is a business decision, therefore please talk to the trader and business person regarding this issue prior to termination of the GTCs.

 I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last sentence states, " ..each party agrees that either party may use these recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate."  My concerns are founded in the use of "these recordings".  As the GISB does not have a provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer. There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.   Enron Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and will not ok a GISB.     In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.  Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or comments about ProLiance.

 Nancy,  Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the "Oral Procedure" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a "writing" and to have been "signed".  For all transactions under the GISB, a written confirmation will be sent by ENA  notwithstanding the choice  "Oral" on the first page.  I am checking on the status of the term deal.

 Jeff Hodge requested that I forward the following collateral language for your review. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.  [4.6.] Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold.  If at any time and from time to time during the term of this Agreement (and notwithstanding whether a Triggering Event has occurred) the Termination Payment that would be owed to a Party in respect of all Transactions then outstanding should exceed $______, such Party as the Beneficiary Party may request the other Party to establish a Letter of Credit as the Account Party in an amount equal to the Termination Payment in excess of $______ (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______), or such other collateral as may be reasonably acceptable to the Beneficiary Party.  The Letter of Credit or other collateral shall be delivered within two Business Days of the date of such notice.  On a Monthly basis, such Letter of Credit may be increased or reduced correspondingly to the amount of such excess Termination Payment (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______).  For purposes of this Section [4.6], the calculation of "Termination Payment" shall include all amounts owed but not yet paid by one Party to the other Party whether or not such amounts are then due, for performance already provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.

 Thanks  for your e-mail regarding a master with Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  ENA has a Canadian form of contract we could work with which will have most of your changes already contained.
