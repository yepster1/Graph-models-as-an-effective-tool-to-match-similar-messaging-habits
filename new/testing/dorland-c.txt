den. 
 Perhaps... 
 When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning beds. Your sunglasses are fine. I wore them while I was hangin' around the house last night. My neighbors think I am a total freak. Maybe it wasn't the sunglasses but the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all night . I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius. I am so bored. I'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good. Better get back to doing NOTHING!  cd 
 How is your wounded eye? 
 Lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they became managers. It doesn't really matter. I never really understood why he cared. I think they look more professional with titles. You should ask Jan.  Chris 
 You are paranoid. 
 Just Laird, Blair, Perry, Tony and a couple of guys around here. Is that a problem? 
 I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday. It is the Enron customer party that day. As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere else after. I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school nights. I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday. Am I going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around town? I hope not. Chicks dig me in those glasses. 
 I had to flee to Houston.  cd 
 I was just kidding. How desperately do you need them? Tonight I will be around in the evening. If you are lucky I might even buy you a cup of coffee. 
 I'll bring them by your office this afternoon. 
 NO 
 What is your work phone number? 
 Hope work is going well. Dusting off my cowboy hat and going stampeding tomorrow. I'll try to give you a call tonight or on the weekend.  Say hi to MH and Wilson and Charlene.  Chris 
 Are you guys still going to desperados (SP?) tommorow?  I think I'm going to head there at about 3PM with Rob Laird and Blair McDermott (you know Blair... the guy with the huge...)  w/b  Chris 
 Could you teach my brother how to use his e-mail?  Thanx  Dorland 
 How goes day #1 in TO? Did you get everything straightened out with the movers? It is pouring rain and 9 celcius here.  Keep it real.  Chris 
 Can you come and see me when you get in. We need to do more to tie out the risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long or short. My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile. We need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie out. If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it. Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Ricardo,  Please make sure someone knows how to update the PJM daily sheet while you are out?  Thanx,  Chris 
 Send me your e-mail address at home. I want to send you that fishing cartoon.  Chris 
 Give me a call and give me directions to Andrew's cabin.  Chris 
 I bought an MP3 player and need some songs. I understand you are the man. Hook me up!  Chris 
 Forest Green Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo  License - MKV 835  Thanx,  Chris 
 Kathy,  Do we have any NX1 / NX3 risk for July?  Chris 
 Can't get away on Monday. See you Saturday night.  Chris 
 I can't believe I didn't sell more ENE... Ouch!!!  cd 
 Saturday at 2:48. We might have to invite Johnny.  Chris 
 Dawn,  I want to allocate my $1000 of flex money to my YMCA membership. I paid for the Y membership with my Visa. How do I get my $1000 back?  Thanx,  Chris 
 KERRIE,  WHAT'S UP? GIVE ME A CALL. I WANT TO HOOK UP WITH JILL SOMETIME.  READY FOR STAMPEDE? ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO REST.  W/B  CHRIS 
 Movie tonight?  Did you talk to MH?  w/b  Chris 
 I'm done!  I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading. I have to set up the economics page but that shouldn't take long.  What about reversals from our currency book? Which way do the reversals from the other books go?  The cash deals aren't all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that.  I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully this makes things easier on you.  Thanx for all your hard work!  Chris 
 You might want to watch out while you're crossing the street. 
 I sent it to him.  Chris 
 You owe me $10 for lunch. I know where you live.  Dorland 
 Dianne,  Do you keep a copy of the spreadsheet you send me everyday? I need some days in May for a new economics model that I am building.  Let me know.  Thanx,  Chris 
 I think I have a lasagna in there. You can have it.  cd 
 When are you coming?  cd 
 Why is the Analyst / Associate program excluded from the referral incentive program?  Chris 
 I am sorry I was short with you on the phone. The gas market is a total shit show and our economics are out by $1M . I worked until midnight last night and I am very tired. We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some steaks on Saturday after golf. Danny and I can leave after dinner or first thing in the morning on Sunday. I hope your (and my) work week improves. See you tommorow!  Chris 
 Mom's birthday is tommorow. What are we going to get her?  Chris 
 That is some good stuff. I hear you are coming our way soon. Look forward to drinking a few beers.  Chris 
 You will have to wait and see :-) 
 Done!  Expect a call from Paul tonight.  Chris 
 What are some good interview questions? Poll your co-workers.  cd 
 I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis. I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say. He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.  Chris 
 Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive?  All the guys at work are saying I shouldn't bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one.  Chris 
 Jai Hawker 974-6721  I won't forget about the $. 
 Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that?  Chris 
 Kathy,  Don't take that deal out until I look at it. I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book (I only wrote it in my red book).  Thanx,  Chris 
 Just a reminder to send me a currency report.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Paul called me today. He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then.  Chris 
 You should reply ASAP. Don't make Peters and Co. wait.  Chris 
 I didn't get a chance to talk to Paul today. Give him a call tommorow.  Chris 
 Will you please run a June NX3/NX1 for our book. 
 Paul How about meeting at 11:30 or 12? I am in the office so give me a call.  CD 3-1663 
 The deed is done.  Chris 
 Find attached resume and cover letter. Hopefully he didn't spel anyting incorrectly.  Dan is really smart and a hard worker. I think he would be a good fit.  Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss (gone to Kelowna golfing for the weekend).  Cheers,  Chris 
 I haven't had a chance to send it yet. Paul is out of the office today so I haven't had a chance to talk to him. I'll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not.  Chris 
 Are you guys still looking for an analyst?  Should I send the resume to Dawn or you directly?  Chris 
 Enron Canada Corp. Suite 1100, 70 York Street Toronto, Ontario M5J 1S9 416-865-3700  Paul DeVries - Director 416-865-3703  Jan Wilson - Manager 416-865-3704 
 Attached is a forecast for the rest of the summer for the X (NWP and PGT).  We should try to have a conference call with the west desk to discuss as soon as we can.  Chris 
 See you there!  CD 
 Sushi tonight?  Ryan Watt says high.  Chris 
 I will be able to attend.  Chris 
 Dan,  I talked to Brad. He said that he would prefer to go out in Red Deer.  Chris 
 That is fine ... I'm off to Red Deer this weekend for Mother's Day and my brother's B-Day but I'll catch you next week.  Beautiful day in downtown Calgary.  Chris 
 A RIDE WOULD BE GREAT CAN YOU PICK ME UP AT 5:30? 
 You owe me $35 for flowers. Nice day to walk to work.  Chris 
 I talked to the boys and we are going to go out on Friday night. We were thinking of going to earl's and then hitting the town.  What do you think?  Chris  (PS How is your day going?) 
 Dan is seriously considering going for this job in TO. What do you think?  Let me know what would be a good time to talk.  Chris 
 Are we on for Wednesday?  Chris 
 We will have to do it early on Wednesday as it is the 2nd last episode of 90210 that night.  Chris 
 How about Thursday.  Chris 
 KERRIE,  WHAT'S UP? HOW IS YOUR WEEK SHAPING UP? I FEEL THE NEED TO EAT RAW FISH AND MOCK RED DEER PEOPLE.  W/B  CHRIS 
 Brad,  Could you suspend my PAC payments to Mackenzie for my investment (not RRSP account) until I let you know to start them again.  Thanx,  Chris 
 I'm updating my palm pilot send your info.  cd 
 Dan,  I have 4 tickets to the Dixie Chicks for Sunday June 4.  Chris 
 If there is room for Brad I won't bother calling Darren.  Chris 
 Dad,  I don't know if Dan wants to play on Saturday, I forgot to ask. Is there room for Brad to play? I talked to him last night. If no, I will probably try to get a game with Brad and Darren Easy on Sunday. Talk to you soon.  Chris 
 Could you please set up the computer training room so I can log on and display a spreadsheet on the screen. We are having a meeting at 3:30.  Thank you  Chris 
 What is the word on golf this weekend?  Chris 
 Carla,  I need to book the computer training room for a meeting Wednesday at 3:30. Can you make that happen?  Let me know.  Chris 
 We are going to have a meeting to discuss S/D in Alberta and the west Wednesday at 3:30 in the computer training room downstairs. The focus of the meeting will be to fine tune our very rough summer forecast for the "X" (NWP Sumas to La Plata B and PGT Kingsgate to Malin).  Everyone is welcome. Free hotdogs and donuts for the first 100 customers! Bring the kids, we've got fun for the whole family.  Chris 
 Dale,  The short description for the above product should read CAN Gas Swap Nit Daily as opposed to Can Gas Swap Nit Monthly.  I don't know why the description changed from when I set it up. Would it be easier for me to set up another product and kill this one?  Let me know.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Jay,  Could you clear the composite pages on my EOL customer ID. I need to add some products and I am having some trouble.  My ID is ADM08892.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 Have you received any messages from me today other than this one?  Chris  (I'm confused!) 
 What's up? How are things? Have you had the boards out yet? I need a snow report. Hope all is well. Better hop but keep in touch.  cd 
 Kerrie,  This is a test. If you receive this message I correctly wrote down your e-mail address.  How was your birthday? Were you reasonably well behaved? How is your week shaping up? We should grab a coffee one night.  Give me a call or w/b  Chris 
 Kerri,  This is a test. If you receive this message I correctly wrote down your e-mail address.  How was your birthday? Were you reasonably well behaved? How is your week shaping up? We should grab a coffee one night soon.  Give me a call or w/b  Chris 
 Tasha,  Sorry I missed your B-Day. I wasn't feeling too great on Saturday so I just layed low. Do you want to get together for a drink one night this week?  w/b  Chris 
 Tasha,  Back from Mexico. It was a much needed rest. Saturday sounds great but I might only be able to stop by for the first part of the evening. Some friends are having a house warming and I said I would stop by there as well. Send me the details.  w/b  Chris 
 Hello,  I can't imagine how dark you guys are. Hope you are soaking up your last couple of days. Have a cubra libra for me!  Love Chris 
 I'll give them to Bugg. I will help move.  Chris 
 I have 2 incredible tickets for the Brooks and Dunn concert on Friday. Do you want them?  Chris 
 No not yet. You need to really think about this because things will move very quickly.  Chris 
 Good news from Toronto.  Work on the documentation.  Chris 
 Scott,  When checking my FX new deals please make sure the following are entered in my model correctly:  Settlement Date FX Rate Dollar amount (All deals are entered from a US dollar perspective) Direction (buy/sell)  Thanx,  Chris 
 Are you guys looking to hire any analysts for the Toronto office?  I know someone I think would be a good fit. Let me know.  Chris 
 Howard,  I filled the Energywest order at -0.36 for May basis.  You made $0.015 us/mm  Chris  See me to make sure I wrote it in properly 
 I made it home. The flight was OK. Shitty movies.  I am very tired today. Tough getting going this morning.  Better get going. Enjoy the rest of your vacation.  Love,  Chris 
 Kathy,  Could you run a report that lists all of the FX hedges in our book. I just want to make sure we aren't missing any deals in our model.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Tasha.  Good to hear from you. I have been quite busy. I am out of town all of next week but we should get together some time. In terms of careers I don't have much in the way of ideas. Have you thiught about sales of some sort. I think you would be good at that. Not necessarily business to consumer sales but perhaps business to business sales. Just a thought.  w/b  Chris 
 Dan,  I need a ride to go get Mom's Jeep sometime tonight.  Give me a call or write back.  Chris 
 Just a note to let you know we have changed our fee structure with NGX.  As of April 1, we are no longer paying any fee for deals beyond the prompt month.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Dan  Just a reminder to order an attachment for my phone.  Chris 
 Varsity called and the water pump needs to be replaced.  It is going to be $700. I told them to go ahead and fix it.  Hope that's OK.  Chris 
 That is some funny shit! 
 No problem.  The walk to work in the snow was invigorating at 6:45. Just kidding, it wasn't that bad.  Big news around here today. Lavo is moving to Houston.  Chris 
 I accidentally entered a X-Alta storage deal twice on Friday. I have already taken it out of our model it now needs to be killed in Tagg and Sitara.  The Tagg deal # is NE4430.  Let me know if there are any problems.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Dad,  I really think you should think about getting in on this 360 networks deal. Even if only a small piece.  I would take a piece.  Talk to you about it on the weekend.  Chris 
 Lavo is going to bring it in for me.  I bought QQQ today at 93. Traded 102 in afterhours trading on the island.  Enron is free.  Chris 
 Did you notice the stock market is a little lower today. The fucking nasdaq is down 10 % today and the dow  was down almost 5% at one point. The TSE was down 770 to 8880 at one point. I think that a lot of margin positions got squeezed out of teck length. I say buy the solid stocks CSCO, LU , MSFT, ENE all look great.  Chris 
 Dad,  Looks like you were smart to wait to get into this market. It has done nothing but go straight down today.  Chris 
 Kathy,  Aquila accidentally traded my financial product instead of my physical product. Could you change the financial deal they did to phys?  I buy 5000 from Aquila at 3.645 for May.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Check out this article!  www.fortune.com/fortune/fortune500/enr.html 
 Dad,  This article does a very good job of explaining what Enron does on a macro level.  Check it out!  Chris  www.fortune.com/fortune/fortune500/enr.html 
 Check out MSFT. Getting the shit kicked out of it. 
 Kathy,  Could you run a mini-book of all the deals in my FX book as of today. I am setting up a new model and want to double check that I have all the correct deals.  Thanx,  Chris 
 It's great that your coming to Calgary to study for a couple of months. You'll have to work extra hard in June so you can kick back during Stampede. Things here are pretty much unchanged. Working quite a bit and doing a little snowboarding and beer drinking on the weekends. Things could definately be worse. Going golfing in Playa del Carmen in a couple of weeks. That should be fun. Looking forward to chilling out by the pool for a week and doing nothing. This year has been a roller coaster ride for my trading profits and I need a break. Met a really cool girl recently. Will advise if anything interesting devolops there. It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have no idea why I am at work. I think I'm going to go to the driving range. Take it easy and w/b!  CD 
 I am going to stay in Calgary tonight.  I am getting a massage tommorow and need to go tanning. I also have some errands to run.  Dan and I might come back saturday afternoon.  What are you guys up to ?  w/b  Chris 
 THE TECH SECTOR IS GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY MO, UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT XEROX!  YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF THE MARKET.  NORTEL IS DOWN $19 / SHARE  CHRIS 
 Dan this is Chris.  I case you have forgotten I am the short guy that sits between Cowan and Lavo.  Just wondering how my SDI direct line is coming.  Just kidding!  Call me 
 Scott,  I think your EOL report was incorrect regarding the Henry Hub gas daily deals from Mar.28th.  Mike and I had a total of 3 sales at 2.945  2 done by Mike  EOL ID #'s 132116 132569  and 1 done by me  EOL ID # 132967  The trade I did was done late in the day and you might have missed it.  We added the deal back to our model.  Let me know if there are any problems.  Chris 
 How's your day going?  Have a look in your humidor tonight. I brought you 13 Monte Cristo #4's ( I got a great deal).  When I put them in there I noticed that you humidor seemed a little dry you might want to fill it up.  2 1/2 weeks to Mexico.  Chris 
 Jill,  Just dropping a note to say hi!  Will write more soon.  Chris 
 Anne,  According to the people at the PEP help desk I don't exist. Maybe that's why I don't get mail or paystubs?  Chris Dorland 
 Dan,  How is my SDI direct line coming?  Chris 
 Dianne,  I didn't get my spreadsheet from Friday. No biggie I just used the average of my buy and sell from stack manager in my model but I would like to have the actual deals.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Kramer,  I'm going to sunny Mexico on April 16th but we should get together for a beer before you go to Banff on the Friday.  Herc 
 How is my SDI direct line coming?  Chris 
 John,  The credit contact at TXU is Chris Papousek 713-210-5085.  Thanx,  Chris 
 John,  I need a response on this issue.  Chris 
 John,  Where are we at on credit with these guys.  They won't sell me gas because they say we need to increase Enron Canada's parental guarentee.  This is costing me deals and I need to know what is going on soon.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Lon,  The last couple of days the April basis market on our morning sheet has been the financial curve rather than the physical.  We should use the physical curve for the prompt month comparison analysis as it is more relevant as the index gets set.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Kathy,  Could you run a NX1 / NX3 report for our book.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Dad,  Canadian 88 up $0.25 to $2.05 
 Hey there Mr. Fancy! How would you feel about doing some golfing this weekend? Give me a shout.  Chris  w 713-853-1663 h 713-588-5131 
 Dad,  Apparently Duke Energy injected 50 Million of cash into Canadian 88. Greg Novall has been replaced as President and CEO.  Chris 
 This file contains a list of FX swaps that need to be transfered from Lavo's currency book to our new currency book.  Once the deals have been transferred the corresponding annuities need to be killed from Lavo's and our financial books.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanx,  Chris 
 New plan.  Staying in Calgary.  Want to go to Earl's?  Call Me! 
 Call me.  Mike talked me into going back to Red Deer.  Chris 
 I don't care what we do. I am going to go for a couple of drinks after work but nothing out of hand.  Mike called me and said he wanted to hook up with Johnny tonight. I don't really want to go back to Red Deer to go out.  Give me a call at work.  Chris 
 Thanx  I guess the question is whether the cost of pending lawsuits is priced into the stock?  I see an RJR Nabisco deal here. Break off Miller and Kraft and let the death merchant division die slowly.  Chris 
 Dan,  Could you set up my SDI direct line on my turrett today please.  Chris 
 Rod,  Any thoughts on Phillip Morris ?  6.35 X Earnings  How bad can you do?  Chris 
 DAN,  BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY IS 1663  DID YOU BUY ANY ?  CHRIS 
 Scott,  The ROM gas daily deal that I did with IM-Central-Transport on Friday appears to be booked backwards. The trader from Houston called me this morning.  The deal # is NB9860.1. Could you see that it is booked properly.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Anne,  I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird.  Thanx  Chris Dorland  (P.S. thanx for the PRC info.) 
 Call me at work.  Chris 
 There continues to be confusion concerning the Premstar deals. Can you come see me when you get in.  Chris 
 BUGG,  DO YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR MIKE KRUEGER?  DORLAND 
 I am organizing a bachelor party and am interested in information on group rates and facility availability.  Our group will require 5-7 tee times, dinner and cocktails. I am hoping to book for one of the following Saturdays:  June 24, 2000 July 8, 2000 July 15, 2000 July 22, 2000  Information on transportation to Red Deer would also be appreciated.   Thank you!  Chris Dorland  403-974-6910 Work 403-283-9232 Home 403-850-1883 Cell. Chris.Dorland@enron.com 
 Ryan,  There is some confusion regarding the premstar deal from yesterday. Could you come see me when you get a minute.  Chris 
 Kathy,  Could we sit down for about a half an hour this afternoon. I Have some questions about how our new FX book is going to work and how to transfer current positions into this book.  Let me know when you have a few minutes ( any time after 2pm).  Chris 
 Kathy,  Could you find out what the breakdown between the $CND and $US monthly index positions transfer to our book were for the month of March.  I just want to double check that it is being represented properly in our currency positions.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Morgan,  Heard through Bugg your in SF now. You should rethink coming up to Kelowna for May long.  Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon. Send me your number and I'll give you a call.  Any good stock ideas? Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board. This could be a Qualcomm.  Gotta hop,  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910 
 Mike,  How are things going? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily.  Things have been relatively quiet lately. Doing a little snowboarding and watching lots of movies. Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 days a week. So far I'm at one in a row. Things are looking good for a repeat today.  Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office. For all your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum now. I think Lambie helped them out there.  Take care,  Chris 
 How is tommorow for sushi?  Chris 
 Check this out! 
 Can you please remove me from this distribution list. I am now in East Power Trading in Houston.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 Call me at Mom and Dad's on Saturday and I'll pop down and see you at work.  Chris 
 What date do I need to get you the money by?  I am going to Red Deer this weekend.  Chris 
 Howdie,  What's the new job? I'm good for sushi any day next week (Tues-Fri). Give me a call or e-mail me.  I'm off to Kimberly snowboarding this weekend. I've done some good snowboarding trips lately (Lake Tahoe and Fernie).  Not making big $$$$$ lately but things are looking up. Going to Santa Fe grill for lunch (mmmm!).  You need to come check out my new home theater system, it's crazy!  See you next week,  Chris 
 Please don't change any deals until we have spoken. I need to talk to John about how these changes will affect his positions.  Chris 
 Mike,  Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.  Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the weekend.  Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.  You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush Juice for a falafel.  Good luck and keep in touch!  Chris 
 Not having to add products (ie. Hub cash) to our composite pages everyday would be more convenient. 
 Brad,  Could you e-mail me your mailing address so I can send off a cheque.  Please make sure I've maximized my foreign content as I don't love the TSE at 9300.  What did you think of that Enron announcement?  Chris 
 Anne,  I didn't receive my USER ID for PEP. Do you know how I get it?  Chris 
 Mike,  Good to hear you arrived safely. Reno was very average. Too much travel. I guess you know all about that.  Hope that work is going well. I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob. Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com, if that doesn't work try  Robert.Benson@enron.com. Let me know if those don't work.  Gotta hop!  Keep in touch,  Chris 
 Brad,  Just thinking about my RRSP's. I want to make sure I have maximized my contributions.  Chris 
 Dianne,  Can you break out buys and sells separately. That format would make it easier for me to transfer the info. to my model.  Chris 
 Dianne,  There doesn't seem to be a new March Aeco product set up. Give me a call.  Chris 
 Hi Andrew!  How are things in London? I am talking to MH right now and he says you are getting a little tired of school. I don't blame you one bit.  I need a vacation. I bet you do to. What do you say to a little Amsterdam trip in April? I think we deserve it.  What do you think of MH changing companies? I think he should get out of that business altogether. He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.  Take care,  Chris 
 Kramer,  Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve. Lavo still trades the term in Alberta but is never around. As for Benny, after an unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil, he has moved to Houston to trade power. No shit!  Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached. I have an idea, like everyone else in the world, for an internet start up and want to pick your brain about the process of doing a business plan, getting VC $'s and such. I don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the industry.  There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich off of it.  Check out enron stock (ENE). We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month. Not bad for a small Texas pipeline company. You would need a sand blaster to get the smile off of Lavorato's face. However I don't think I'm going to retire on my Enron options any time soon.  Gotta hop!  Dorland  (PS You should send Wilson a Bigwords t-shirt. The Jannon's would do the logo justice.) 
 Mike,  Change my e-mail address to Chris.Dorland@enron.com. You have a really old one that I'm surprised is still supported (cdorlan@ect.enron.com).  Chris  (Like you will every see a $ from this!) 
 Kramer,  How are things going? We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip sometime in the  next few months.  Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged. No chicks. Work is going great. Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time.  Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here. I am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics.  Take it easy and w/b,  Dorland 
 Andrew,  Nice to hear from you. Hope all is well in the UK. The millenium came and went and I think I had a good time.  I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML. Good for him. That is a shit business with no future. The broker is the buggy whip of the financial  services industry.  I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to visit. I have to run but I'll keep in touch.  Take care,  Chris 
 If you find any fundamental problems with this model let me know. 
 Angela,  I'll take the 2 tickets for Feb. 25 th vs. Phoenix  Chris 
 The tag number on this deal is N67904.2  Please address all future deal inquiries of this nature to Scott Adams or Kathy Reeves.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 How about my RRSP contributions for this year?  Chris 
 Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst. I had about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer between Friday and this morning.  Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all I know.  Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing happen to him last week.  Chris 
 Happy Anniversary! I will deliver the card in person in about 10 days.  Chris 
 George has Oyster Creek coming back Nov. 25. We have it coming back Nov. 17 on our sheet. Let's assume George's info. is the best.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Just a note regarding my plans for Thanksgiving. I am going to fly out the afternoon of Nov. 21 and will be back in the office on Monday the Nov.27. I will need PJB to cover my daily trading on Nov.22.  Chris 
 I don't know anything about any sunglasses. Just kidding, I was wearing them all weekend.  Chris 
 So the squares are not all the same size. It is an optical illusion rather that a brain teaser.  Chris 
 Any word on my expense $?  Chris 
 Margaret,  How do I get to your office? I would like to come by and get my Visa documents.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 713-853-1663 
 I have received my health insurance and perscription drug card but not my dental card. Hopefully today my mail will find me.  Chris Dorland 
 I haven't called Northern Trust yet. I will call them this afternoon. With regard to the benefits I don't think I have received the 2001 benefits package yet but I will check. If I don't want to change my coverage do I have to fill anything out?  Chris 
 H town is good. Work is crazy but I like my new role. The weather is nice vs. snow in Cow town. How are things with you? Are you still commuting across the country? What is your buddy at William's name? Do you know what region he trades? Getting busy now better hop.  Keep in touch,  Chris 
 Patrick,  Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well. I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for you and keep in touch.  Chris 
 Somebody should check Drewlo's clothes for paint thinner.  CD 
 Laurel,  I have been transferred to Houston, TX. Could you please take me off the Calgary distribution list.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 Lloyd,  I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM load forecast model works. I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to day sensitivity analysis. I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week works for you.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 I haven't received the tickets yet but they are on the way.  Thanx,  Chris

 I am at EB3116e.  CD 
 Ricardo,  This consultant report has Brunner Island back on. Our sheet doesn't have it coming back untill Nov.3. Which is correct?  Chris 
 FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). Things in Houston are good. The weather is great now. Year round golf is nice. Power is a total shit show. The volatility is crazy and this is the off season. I need to get rested up for the summer. Take it easy  CD 
 Jennifer,  My pay stub seems to be lost in in the abyss. Is there someone I can call to make sure it finds me?  Chris 
 Hawker,  What's going on? How are things in Cow town? You trading a book yet? Playing any poker? Bingham was here for Q-School last week. Didn't go so well.  Cd

 Mike,  What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. I'll call you one night this week.

 Brad,  Can you add Ricardo.Perez@enron.com to this distribution list?  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 Thanks for your attention but I already bought a vehicle.  Chris Dorland 
 Jill,  All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. Better go but keep in touch!

 Just thought I would drop you guys a note and let you know that I am coming to Houston on Thursday night. I will be in the office Friday morning but I am planning to do a bunch of running around after the cash market slows down. See you in a couple of days.  Chris Dorland

 Brad,  Can you change my address in your system (and with fund companies) to my mom and dad's address. I haven't heard from this nurse yet and I am leaving next week. Please be sure to let me know if any of that Clarica transfer doesn't go smoothly.  Thanx,  Chris

Demand (Load)  - Historic load information for PJM  Interchanges  - What are the historic imports and exports in and out of PJM - What are the costs associated with wheeling power in and out of PJM ?   Thank you for all your help and please include any other info. you think may be relevant.  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910

 Margaret,  Please send them to the Calgary office to my attention:  Enron Canada Corp. Atten: Chris Dorland 3500 Canterra Tower Calgary, AB T2P 4H2  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 Thank you! 
 Margaret,  I was wondering if you sent my visa documents yesterday or today. I will be out of the office this afternoon but I would come back if my visa documents are going to me here.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Everything seems OK. Hopefully I will hear from the mover's this afternoon.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Margaret,  Could you send the Visa documents to my office:  Enron Canada Corp. 3500 Canterra Tower 400 - 3rd Ave. SW Calgary, AB   T2P 4H2  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 Margaret,  Just wondering how my Visa was coming along? I had a confusing conversation with Jeanne in relocation services this morning. The way I understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same time or after I leave the country. She seemed to think that I had to go to the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada. Can you shed some light on this?  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork for him.  Chris
