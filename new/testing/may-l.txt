 As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time fits in your schedules.  Thanks,  Larry 
 Please enable Flecther Sturm to sell options 
 This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.  In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes.  If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.  Thank You,  Larry May 
 I have  a dental appointment in the Post Oak area at 400pm.  I can meet until 410 or so.
