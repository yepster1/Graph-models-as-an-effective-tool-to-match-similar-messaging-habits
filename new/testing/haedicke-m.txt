 Great job!  Thanks.  Mark    Mary Clark@ENRON 01/29/2001 02:46 PM 
 Dad:  The name I have is Dr. Vinberg.  He is a therapist in Houston and is in his 80s.  I talked to him today and I thought he seemed good.  He recommended that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if it is productive.  His number is 713-622-1441.  He charges $150 per hour and I will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to Houston. Give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you.  If he is, I will propose dates and we can see if they work for everyone.  Love,  Mark 
 I have asked Dan Lyons to give you a call on this.  Mark    Greg Johnston 01/29/2001 05:36 PM 
 Dan:  I think you should add a sentence that you will continue to be directly involved in LNG matters including the contracts for Dabhol and that addtional resources are being developed in London both inside and outside.  Mark    Daniel R Rogers@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/30/2001 04:23 PM

 Mark:  Thanks for the info.  I had a great time at the football game!  I think you will like Dubai.  It has some great restaurants.  Regards,  Mark    Mark Evans 02/02/2001 09:54 AM 
 Jane:  Thanks for the update.  It is very important for our traders to understand the documentation challenges.  Mark    Jane McBride@ENRON 02/02/2001 12:16 AM 
 Janette:  Please make contact with the gem broker below and set a time where I can meet him and look at some topaz, emeralds and opals.  I want to look at loose stones.  I may need to talk to him before I go.  Mark 
 Frank:  I am not in favor of this promotion.  I think in the new environment that it could be negative for him.  Let's talk about it.  Mark    Frank Sayre@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/05/2001 09:36 AM 
 I would suggest Dan Lyons from ENA Legal for Vision and Values.  Mark 
 Alan:  This makes sense to me.  Please get with John or send your e-mail to him and see if this matter can be resolved quickly.  Mark    Alan Aronowitz 02/04/2001 10:58 AM 
 J: yes.  Mark 
 Janette:  Schedule some time for me to go to this gallery.  Maybe early Wednesday afternoon.  Mark 
 Thanks.  I want to go to the gallery.  Mark    Randy Young@ENRON 02/02/2001 06:37 PM

 I would love to do that but I have a commitment on Saturday night in Houston.  Thanks for looking into it for me.  Next time.  See you next week. Mark    Sami Arap@ENRON 02/09/2001 05:31 AM

 Mr. Fournier:  This is Janette Elbertson, Mark Haedicke's Assistant.  I spoke with your assistant this morning and this meeting has been rescheduled for Thursday, March 1, at 11:30 am in Jim Derrick's office.  Lunch is scheduled after the meeting if that meets your schedule.  Mark Haedicke is traveling this week.  I will call your e-mail to his attention upon his return on Friday.      "DAN FOURNIER" <dan.fournier@blakes.com> 02/09/2001 09:42 AM 
 I think it must be in Moran's area.   Mark 
 Mina:  Mark Haedicke does not have his lap top computer with him so he probably has not seen this e-mail.  Janette Elbertson     Mina Miyakawa@ENRON 02/13/2001 03:40 PM 
 Does it still make sense to have these meetings anymore?  Maybe just sit in on Novak's meeting.   Mark Haedicke 
 Hopefully when we recruit for other areas, like LNG and the like, we will pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience.  It seems like overkill to recruit just for shipping.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke    Mark Evans 02/14/2001 05:28 PM 
 I am not sure why that is.  Non-trading work is off a little so maybe that is it.  Be sure to touch base with Lance Schuler about the work he sees coming up.   I am happy to talk about it.  Mark    "Swanstrom, Bill" <BSwanstrom@lockeliddell.com> 02/15/2001 10:45 PM 
 fyi

 Please keep Lance Schuler and me up to speed on these issues.  Thanks.  Mark Haedicke 
 Below are Mark Haedicke's revisions to the announcement.   The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new We are pleased to announce organizational changes that have been implemented in to the Enron South America legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets.  Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new responsibilities within Enron.  Replacing him will be John Novak, who will become General Counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new structure is attached.  We believe This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal support across business lines within South America while improving coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development initiatives under way in the region.        John Novak@ENRON 02/16/2001 02:02 PM 
 Thanks.  I put the risk at a 2.  Mark    Dale Rasmussen 02/16/2001 03:17 PM 
 Yes, send a resume to Julia Murray.  Mark    Eric Thode@ENRON 02/13/2001 03:43 PM 
 What do you think of the letter?    Mark 
 fyi 
 Wow!  Things can change quickly.  Thanks.  Mark    Rob Walls@ENRON 02/20/2001 04:46 PM 
 I am available as a last resort.  I have asked Alan Aronowitz who is the GC of Enron Global Markets to make a presentation.  I will let you know.   Mark    "Liz O'Sullivan" <LOSULLIVAN@isda.org> 02/20/2001 11:36 AM

 Let's send it out today.  Mark 
 Rob:  How can we get some relief on this issue?  Should we set up a call with Peter and me?  There really is an earnings impact.   Let me know.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 It's ok with me.  Mark    "JOHN G KLAUBERG" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 02/19/2001 01:35 PM 
 Congrats!  Things seem to be building rapidly now on the Continent.  Mark 
 You would need to start out in the associate program.  Good luck.  Mark 
 No need to do a risk memo if the legal risk rating would be a 1.  Is that what this one would be?  Mark 
 The report is well done.  For my purposes it could be much shorter -- really in a bullet list format.  Thanks.  Mark    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/15/2001 03:34 PM 
 John:  What is the status on this?  I now have Eddie Daniels dedicated full time to Cuiba.  Hopefully that will help you some.  Regards,  Mark 
 Rex:  We are trying to make this as limited as possible.  Can you define specifically what requires an exception?  I am the signoff for the wholesale group, but it makes sense to be consistent across Enron.  Regards,  Mark    Sharon Morgan/ENRON@enronXgate 02/13/2001 11:11 AM

 Jim:  Here is the background of the "dispute" with Blakes.  There is a lot of emotion on both sides.  I believe we need Blakes on a going forward basis in Canada.  Mark Haedicke 
 I think it is a good opportunity to promote standardized contracts.  Mark    Ruth Ainslie <RAinslie@isda.org> 02/10/2001 05:07 PM

 The attached report summarizes current significant legal activities of EWS Legal as of February 15, 2001.  This report does not attempt to list all transactions or include reference to on-going maintenance of completed transactions.  Please let me know if you have questions. 
 My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives business is in North America.  We are growing rapidly in derivatives in Europe, but still quite small.  In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor on other continents.  That is different than major equity, currency or interest rate traders.  Mark 
 Ruth: The press release looks fine.  Mark    Ruth Ainslie <RAinslie@isda.org> 02/28/2001 10:57 AM

 Please update the attached Legal Risk Report.   Send the revised report by e-mail.  Thank you. 
 I am willing to do this on the 20th, but only for one hour maximum.  See if Jim has any interest and then get back to Peter.   Mark 
 please set up.  Mark 
 Chris:  Thanks for the message.  I appreciate the feedback.  I know she has been working particularly hard lately!  We are working to add resources, but that is not easy.  Thanks for your support.  Mark    Christopher F Calger 03/04/2001 12:15 PM

 I am confused by this.  Does this mean Cuiaba in South America would be covered?  What is the significance if it is?  Mark    Rob Walls/ENRON@enronXgate 03/02/2001 04:21 PM 
 Does Matt have time to do all the LNG work?  My guess is that he may have the time.  Mark    Alan Aronowitz 03/02/2001 02:28 PM

 Thanks for raising the issue.  Keep me posted!   Mark    Christian Yoder 03/08/2001 09:38 AM 
 Do you have any comments on this contract?  Please let me and Chris know. Mark 
 Mark:  I would like to get together at the AGM.  I will ask my assistant to work on a time would could meet and propose that to you.  Hope things are going well.  Mark Haedicke    Mark.Harding@CliffordChance.com 03/07/2001 12:55 PM 
 Thanks.  Please don't hold up the meeting for me but if possible I will attend.  Mark    Christian Yoder 03/07/2001 12:20 PM 
 Peter:  As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  I don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in Canada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  We can't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim.  Regards,  Mark    Peter Keohane 03/07/2001 08:46 AM 
 Greg:  Thanks.  Was a dash done on this?  Mark    Greg Johnston 03/06/2001 03:49 PM 
 Brenda:  It is standard operating procedure to copy all assistants (to the extent you know who they are) on e-mails such as this.  In the future please make sure you copy me on any e-mails pertaining to meetings or business lunches in which Mark Haedicke should participate.  Thank you for your cooperation in the future.      Brenda Whitehead 03/02/2001 11:35 AM 
 Shouldn't you and Rick do that together so as not to have confusion.  Mark 
 Thanks.    Greg Johnston 03/08/2001 05:25 PM

 I am ok with it for the spot deals.   Mark    Michelle Blaine/ENRON@enronXgate 03/16/2001 01:48 PM

 Yes, thanks.  Mark    Rob Walls/ENRON@enronXgate 03/19/2001 11:12 AM 
 Let's catch up when you get back to Houston.  We can go to lunch or set up time to meet in the office.  Mark    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/15/2001 07:45 PM 
 Put this meeting on my schedule.  Mark 
 I don't have a problem with it, subject to our normal litigation exception. Mark    "JOHN G KLAUBERG" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 03/14/2001 06:04 PM 
 Not much should overlap with our agenda.  Thanks.  Mark    Lisa Mellencamp 03/19/2001 02:20 PM 
 You participated in the OGC meeting which was fine.  I did not want to miss out on your participation.  Going foward, please join  the Legal Committee starting this coming Monday and every other week.  Mark 
 It may be too late now, but I would like to meet with them.  Mark    Peter Keohane 03/12/2001 06:00 PM

 Eddy: Let's get together and go over the agenda before the meeting.  Thanks. Mark    Eddy Daniels@ENRON 03/20/2001 05:18 PM 
 Great news!   Thanks.   Mark    Peter Keohane 03/20/2001 07:07 PM

 Please remember if you are going to be out of the office on vacation or for business matters have your assistant send me an e-mail (and copy Janette) with the dates you will be out and the telephone number where you can be contacted.  Thank you. 
 Please put on my schedule.  Mark 
 Put this on my schedule for tomorrow.  Mark 
 Neal:  Thanks for the message.  We are tracking the developments in Washington very carefully.  Have Dan give me a call, if he would like.  Hope you and your family are doing well.  Take care.  Mark 
 To ensure a smooth flow of bank resolutions to the necessary signatories, I am requesting that Enron Treasury first route the bank resolutions to Angela Davis (EWS Legal) to be initialed before being routed to John Lavorato or Louise Kitchen.  If you have any questions please call me at 3-6544.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Thanks for the ideas!  Mark    Mark Tawney/ENRON@enronXgate 03/26/2001 01:40 PM 
 Bob:  I am going to pass on the playoff tickets.  Thanks.   Mark    "Baird, Bob" <RBaird@velaw.com> 03/27/2001 01:45 PM 
 I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further.  Mark    Orlando Gonzalez@ENRON 03/27/2001 01:51 PM 
 Let me know if anyone in your group is interested.  Mark 
 I think New York is a fair compromise, for North American transactions. Litigating in London is very expensive so I think that is not a good alternative.  Mark    Mark Powell 03/27/2001 11:02 AM 
 It looks great.  Mark    Vance Meyer@ENRON 03/27/2001 06:39 PM 
 Your comments 
 Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " future California", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put in place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on "inability to pay debts as they become due".  Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements. 
 Louise:  Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals.  It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.  I am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.  Let's talk about what are the objectives.  Great question!  Mark    Louise Kitchen 03/28/2001 04:27 PM 
 I will call Mark Golden to respond in a few days.  I don't think this is entirely negative for us.  We can use it to get the products we want.  Mark 
 Add my name as a person to contact.  Mark    Elizabeth Sager 03/29/2001 11:16 AM

 It has become customary to prepare Unanimous Consents of Directors for many transactions even if such actions are not required by the relevant By-laws and/or Certificate of Incorporation.  Please consider carefully whether Unanimous Consents of Directors are necessary or appropriate in a particular transaction, i.e., the transaction is a significant transaction or evidence of authority is required for a legal opinion.  When in doubt, please review the By-laws and Certificate of Incorporation of the relevant entity and discuss the matter with a member of the Office of the General Counsel.  Thank you. 
 I will pass on it.  Thanks.  Mark    Louise Kitchen 03/30/2001 07:49 AM

 This is way too much of a commercial!  Two thirds of it speaks only to Kiodex.  Tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial.  He said he was going to discuss new commodities and slant his presentation torward new commodities.  He needs to do more.  Mark    Rosemary Ryan <RRYAN@isda.org> 03/30/2001 11:10 AM 
 Greg Piper raised the following questions:  Is ENW a marketing affiliate? Is EOL a marketing affiliate? Sally Beck's organization? Can Beck's organization process transactions for CMS pipelines?

 Great job!   Mark 
 Let's schedule a meeting for Mark Taylor, you and me with the consultant who we already had conversations with.  We can formulate our response.  Mark    Janette Elbertson 04/06/2001 09:50 AM 
 Alan, my quick impression is that the checklist format is identifying a number of matters for discussion in a way that will be efficient.  What is your impression?  Mark 
 I look foward to meeting you.  I have asked my assistant to get time scheduled.  Mark 
 What is the answer on this?  Mark 
 add to my schedule.   M

 Please handle.  I think you should send an email to the OGC and ask if they are aware of any such contracts.  Mark 
 How would we do this efficiently in EWS?  Mark 
 Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts as described below by Sharon Butcher.  "The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current contracts.  This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.  In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.  We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

 I am responding on behalf of Mark Haedicke.  We have checked with our department and our lawyers are not aware of any such contracts as you described in your e-mail.  Barbara Gray responded, "I am unaware of any subcontracts for this period.  I do know that we have used minority lawyers, but that does not appear to be responsive to the question."  Thank you. 
 Orlando;  I am ok with the your suggestion.  Hope you are doing well.  Mark    Orlando Gonzalez@ENRON 04/17/2001 06:18 AM

 Steve and Peter:  From a control point of view, we should have at least one director based in Houston.  Does that present any significant tax risk?  Let us know.  Mark Haedicke

 The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the District Court for discovery and eventually trial. 
 Greetings:  John, I would like to promote Hodge to VP this time around.  I know our system has changed to get that done, but I wanted to get your support on this.  I believe Jeff has done a good job  and added significant value for a long time and has earned it.  Give me your thoughts.  Mark

In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a further review of the stay.  It is likely EES' service contract with USC will expire before any trial at the District Court. 
 Here are my thoughts so far:  1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron Rothwarg  2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week  3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months  4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA  5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval  6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot be hedged 
 FYI 
 I think we will need to do something for Peter.  I would be interested in HRs view on how much.  Mark    David Oxley/ENRON@enronXgate 05/14/2001 02:19 PM 
 The lawyers had a kick-off meeting today.  Vicki and I echoed your point on not shutting down the business.   We have a great team assembled and I think it will calm down the traders in EWS.  I will keep you posted.  Mark Haedicke    David W Delainey@EES 05/11/2001 05:55 PM

 Not clear at this point.  No deals have been done.  My guess is that it will be Lance and his group.  I will let you know when it gets sorted out.  Mark    "Swanstrom, Bill" <BSwanstrom@lockeliddell.com> 05/20/2001 12:04 PM 
 Please review and set up a meeting with me to establish a plan for this committee.  Mark 
 Stacy and Ruth:  I propose the following agenda for the NA energy committee:  1.  convergence of commodity forms -- need to build a team to pursue this 2.  California energy issues/solutions 3.  standardized provisions for master energy contracts -- setoff, netting, termination, etc. 4.  bankruptcy 5.  CFTC study of retail derivatives 6.  emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc.  Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European conference. Let me know what you think.

 Enron has complained about the quality of the information given to Inside FERC.  It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the name of the counterparty confidential.  We want the data to be as good as possible.  If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations.  Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US.    Peter Keohane Sent by: Sharon Crawford 06/01/2001 02:56 PM
