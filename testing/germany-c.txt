 How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free lunch and my New Power golf shirt? 
 I just changed the rate on Tenn/transport uage deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0116.  We should get back 85,155 x $.0984==$8,300 tonight. 
 Dan does not know what this contract is used for.  I think it has (or had) something to do with the Boston Gas contract.  We currently use k#29667 for that.  I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000.  Comments / questions? 
 james r barker ees      patricia downey ees  donnie myers/na/enron     ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14. The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put in some of the buy/sale activity.  My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy 
 Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.  The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective June 1.  Please look at the following contracts/deals.  Contract Deal  Comment 779234  003589  Boston releasing to CES 771157  003668  CES releasing to ENA 771224  003786  ENA releasing to Energy Express  Contract Deal  Comment 779233  003581  Boston releasing to CES 771156  003666  CES releasing to ENA 771225  003785  ENA releasing to Energy Express    Thanks. 
 I just had a thought.  Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.  You don't need to do anything with it.  Its more of an awareness type thing. 
 I have to look for the house key at home.  I know I don't have it on my keyring.

 I just changed the rate on Algon/transport usage deal 233358 from $.26 to $.0206.  We should get back 155,000 x $.2394 == $37,000 tonight. 
 Anyone there?  Helloooooo! 
 ENA purchased 11.000 dth from New Power at IF flat (deal 509454).  I created a sale deal 522203 (sale to New Power at IF + .0125).  Please Bookout these deals. 
 Rosemary's replacement. 
 Hi Gang.  Doug found my mistake and the correct price is $4.6913.  I changed the price in Sirara.  Sorry Jeff. 
 Scoop 
 Too heck with the little toot. What about that camera info??? 
 Brace yourself.  I'm putting in the June charge of $6.26 !!!  I just got the invoice today. 
 This deal is gas ENA sold to CES for Energy Express.  The daily volume was 10,322 dth (a total of 309,660 for the month).  The price is CGAS IF + $.0175 + Variable + $.02 demand for ENA transport   I just changed the price in Sitara.  My calculation shows a price of $4.6738.  Jeff, I apologize for this if you have sent out the invoice already.  Please correct the invoice for this deal and let me know when you send it out.  Thanks. 
 FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.  John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer. 
 New Power purchased A06 gas from ENA.  Please bookout dealsl 521753 (sale to New Power) with 521780 (purchase from New Power). 
 Here is the transport sheet for July.  I believe its fairly current. 
 OK - what kind of car and where are you and I going on vacation? 
 I would like to RSVP for Judy Townsend and myself.  Is it too late, will we get a free lunch, you how Judy loves a free lunch.  Also, we will not be able to attend until around 11:30 am.  Let me know it thats ok. 
 I think we should try an evening meal again.  This is fun ain't it? 
 Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.  We took all the August activity to 0.  This is how these deals should be balanced  Deal 318562 with 318686.  And 318691 with 318682.  I'll look at the economics in the morning. 
 We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.  CGAS does not bill us anything on this contract, KO does.  KO somehow gets the information from CGAS.  That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom. We don't even talk to KO anymore.  I wish KO would reference the CGAS contract on the KO invoice.  Maybe we could ask KO to do that.  I had to chat with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information. 
 I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity. I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport expense.   According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small. Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.  Questions?? 
 Let's try next week, I'm bouncing in and out this week. And THANKS!!! 
 I entered 3 deals that I do not want included in the P&L tonight.  They are all purchases from New Power  Deals 521336 521342 521345 
 I love Chic Fil A!@!! 
 I'm going over the Park & Loan discounts on CNG for May.  I need to see the invoice to compare what we were billed to what CNG is showing on the discount letter.  Gloria, Terry does not have the invoice.  Could you get me a copy please?  Thanks. 
 Colleen, this is the email response I received.  Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company called "Capacity Center"?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is authorizing these payments.  Thanks.

 Yep.  Went to Dad's on Sat, left Mon before lunch.  Took my woman and went to Jerry's on July 4th.  Had a good time.  He does a good job cooking on his BBQ pit.  I was very tired on Wed though. 
 Not a problem.  She can stuff the little sucker if I get all the other stuff.  I'll start working on that 50 lbs right after I finish this cookie. 
 Not hardly.  Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle, let me get my flying licenses, and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle?  I will also need to travel back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family. 
 How's that going anyway?  I forgot I had a marriage "arrangement" in the works! 
 Let me know when you want to chat about NYPA.  It should only take about 15 min.  I would like Beverly present because someday I would like to be agent for NYPA on their contract. 
 What about my camera info????? 
 Shame on you :o) 
 Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve CanFibre.  However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.  Per Marde, CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.  OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre. 
 We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July.  The parking deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558.  When we get cut by an upstream or downstream pipeline, Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the supplies and markets. 
 Joanie Veselack is leaving.  She is going to PG&E in Bethesda 
 The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and the deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from all other deals.  Please let me know if there are any questions. 
 I will enter this deal in the system and let you guys know what the deal number is. 
 We are borrowing 110,000 dth (deal 322012) on Transco on the 30th and paying the gas back on July 1st (deal 322007).  We are paying Trco a one time fee of $.0386 (see below)  Volume   Fee 0 to 50,000  $.015 50,001 to 100,000 $.05 100,001 to 110,000 $.10 
 I'm still looking for other emails. 
 I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you an update. 
 Dick will be doing some deals with New Power that is seperate from the "Asset Management" deal.  Following are the spot deals Dick has done with Mike Garred  Deal  Vol  Price  Comment 516083  10000  8.00  sell to NP for the 5th at the pool 521475  20000  8.28  sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP. 510586  1435  7.20  buy from NP at WGL on the 1st 513896  1500  7.25  buy from NP at WGL on the 2nd-4th   These deals have no impact on the "asset management" deal with New Power. 
 FYI.  Also take a look at today's Gas Daily 
 Hey, send them again.  I don't have them. 
 I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th holiday.  I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.

 ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio (10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks like this pool can be terminated.  Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this after the 4th.  Let me know if anyone has any questions. 
 Dick has this in at a $6.89, I assume you are ok with saving $2,250 on the $.005. 
 JD is a dead man.   Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch! 
 The password is 2000tran07 
 John, call me when you get a chance.  I called 330-493-7790 and there is no voicemail. 
 I show no sales to CES for the month of July.  I created deal 315460 to bookout with deal 217769 and deal 315471 to bookout with deal 223967.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 FYI.  I changed the meter number on this deal from IMB-508914 to 9170.  They are both Trco Non NY. 
 Hey Buddy!  I just had a chat with Kori.  She is very sad she didn't get a birthday kiss from you.  There will be a little birthday bash on Friday July 7th and she will be there.  What do you think? 
 I would like to RSVP for Chad's party. 
 At my Dad's Sat and Sun.  Watching fireworks with Ingrid probably Mon or Tues.  We can go drinking one nite. 
 {Cough cough cough, Facial Expression Facial Expression}   SURE!  Ruggles on me! 
 If its Stephanie you die!  I'm working on killing JD now. 
 We have a new backhual contract from Transco.  Term  12/8/2000 - 12/31/2000 Demand $.07 k#  3.7714 Volume  5,000 Rec  Zone 6 Del  Zone 1   I just set this up in Sitara.  Please try to set up an activity number on this contract this afternoon.  Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 3, 2 to 3, or 3 to 3.  We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle. 
 Hi gang.  I have not changed anything on the storage deals since the middle of last week.  I am still showing our projected ending balance on June 30th to be 3,626,785 dth.  Let me know if you see something different.  Thanks 
 Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas into CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.   You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).  thanks 
 as soon as you vgive me back my ice chest 
 Hey buddy.  We are having all sorts of problems with St 30, 90% internal. You should try to sell to someone else if possible.  Maybe Williams?? 
 Went home and went to bed buddy!  So which of the lovely young ladies did you spend time with? 
 Tim, call Dick Jenkins about this capacity.  His number is 3-5136 
 This transaction involves 5 contracts.  Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of ($.125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months.  I don't think Nat Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out. 
 My location is EB 3224b  and anyday after 3:45PM is good for me.  Thanks

 Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.  IAS  <== we just created k# A02353 ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262 FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.   Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork to legal and I need it back by Monday morning. 
 I called Peoples, Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any questions.  I also received one voice mail from the Can Fibre guy and I have not heard from him either.  Don't seem like anything is getting done.  I hope you had a good weekend. 
 Modest Too!! 
 What happened to all my emails?  How's my Duff?  What's going on? 
 We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS.  FSS We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day. However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.  COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.  Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.  Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today's prices that cost about $.105  Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.  Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.  Let me know if you have any questons. 
 Hey Rhonda, my sources tell me that this $3.324 is the correct price. Thats a big bonus for EES. 
 Check out this site:  > http://www.ozmasplace.cjb.net > 
 Good job.  Now what price should we bill EES. 
 Hey Greg.  Hope this works.  My phone number is 713-853-4743. 
 We currently have the following transport contracts on CNG for July.  k#  MDQ  Comment 5A2500  15000  Oak to BG&E  5A2551  4003  Corn to BG&E 5A2551  383  Lebanon to BG&E  5A2526  3947  Corn to Leidy  Total  23,333 dt   Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July.  And we can still take 7950 dth from Cornwell. 
 Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.  k# 560104 5A2529 
 ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is correct?  Thanks 
 Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?  I want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility.  Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments for your year end review.  Thanks. 
 You make it sound like you are going away for good.  I'll see you when you come back. 
 Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel. I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.  Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not. 
 You will probably get an invitation to the wedding.  The date is Sat, July 29th, in Mangum, OK. at 3:00pm in the afternoon.  I'll expect to see you.

 I'm trying to change the Receipt Meter on deal 235367 from meter 7126 to meter 010902.  I'm not trying to change the Receipt Interconnect point, I'm trying to change the Receipt Point (From).  I can't change it.  Whats up? 
 I'm not sure if it matters but it will make it easier to find, I think. 
 So both of these suppliers are now fixed price because  they locked in the NYMX?

 My YTD nymx and your YTD nymx don't tie.  Here is my worksheet.  Would take a look at it and let me know which deals are wrong.  You are a wonderful person by the way. 
 Early morning, right?  I want to be rested for the big party. 
 $4.09 by $4.105 
 Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will.  Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing. Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?  Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? If yes, how many meters?  2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume  Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.  Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this. 
 How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)?

 Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct?

 Hi 
 Call Chris at you convience about EES/CES. 
 Cool 
 Bid is bouncing around $4.03 to $4.06 
 This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent.  Doyle is .8 miles off the Transco mainline.  What do you think?  I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to Transco.  It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St 65. 
 Test.  Does this work? 
 AGA is 78.  Screen dipped to $3.95, currently at $4.05 / $4.06 
 Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal.  Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

 Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet.  The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.  We currently have 20,000 dt in the sitara.  We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes.  thanks 
 Let us update the pricing and we will send you a confirm today or tomorrow. 
 We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.  It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.  The transport usage deal is 289228.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, $4.455, and $4.475.  Comment? 
 I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month.  On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth. On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.  This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000. 
 Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid ENA for October activity? 
 Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a problem but just in case. 
 I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals.  However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000.  Transco Offers #20100 for 15 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.4899, Wharton to Algon #20101 for 5 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.8607, Wharton to Algon  CNG Offers #13817 for 67 dth effective 6/1/2000- 3/31/2003 from k# 5A2529, transport to Leidy  #13824 GSSTE, effective 6/1/2000 - 3/31/2006, Demand Vol = 132, Capacity Vol= 14661.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Chris 713-853-4743 
 I didn't even know about deal 219618.  I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading. 
 Done. 
 Whoo hooo!  I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.  This affects our demand charges on CGAS. 
 We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.  Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know. 
 I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this ticket), 268090, and 268093.  Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August.  I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year. 
 Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their customers to another company. 
 Hi.  I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday.  Should I let someone in your office know about that? 
 John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.  I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price adjusted for dth??  I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563.  I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?  Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals.  Let me know if anyone has any questions.  Thanks cg 3-4743

 its a good thing i a good looking stud! 
 I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000. My mistake. 
 Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left someone out.  This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.  East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing  CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should know the actual volume in the next day or so.  Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.  National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.  Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.  CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG. 
 I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara. Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000.  Deals 165415 and 165423. 
 I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 3/31/2000. The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.  Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow.  Thanks. cg

 Chris, Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42.  Can you provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq. 
 Hi! 
 I killed deal 233231.  The contract number was incorrect. 
 There are five CNG postings listed below.  Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H.

Dale Rexrode Di rector, Producer Services & Business Development  Posting #5 Posted May 9, 2000 9:07 a.m.    Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved. We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding the Barbour County High Pressure System.  The Dominion "bubble" affected is 4205.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations. The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the pipeline system.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office. The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression. Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.

 Scott Goodell will be attending as well.  Could you make sure he is covered for lunch please? 
 May cash $4.00  June Numbers Nymx   $3.78 CNG Basis Bid  $.215 CNG Index Prem (.0075)  Net   $3.9875  actually losing $.01 or so before we figure the fuel of 1.95%  Fuel Cost at $4.00 = $4.00/(1-.0195) - $4.00 = $.08  Now its $.09 in the hole (.01+.08) 
 As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.  We still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our "approved" max monthly injection amount.  In Sitara, I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in the month of August. 
 One free soda for you upon request and providing I have $.50 in my pocket.

 Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June? 
 We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day)  through July.  Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.  Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens.  ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES. 
 Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice?? 
 Hey you said I could delete this one.  Yea!! 
 I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything.  I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow. 
 Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right? 
 Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month.  EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde is going to check around. 
 Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted. 
 I'm always willing to drive for a free lunch. 
 Did Cove Point approve that? 
 I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry.  Don, do you have a fax number I could send it too? 
 New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine.  There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.  This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically forget the "work".  If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever. 
 As usual, you are awesome!  Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you get them.  Thanks

 I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.  We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000  That's all for now.

 I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424. 
 Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.  The daily volume is 9189, the deal number is 227196.  I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month.    Thanks 
 We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.  This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale. Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us. Term:  11/1/1999 - 10/31/2000 Type:  EFP Differential: $.235 Point:  Tco Pool Trans Date: 5/6/1999  Sitara Deals:  158716/227890   the price in sitara is Tco Index.  Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me.  I will gladly give this to David.  Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara. Thanks. 
 There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 310,000  for Dec 310,000 for Jan 280,000 for Feb  Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?  Thanks chris 
 We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been addressed? 
 I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions.  Thanks 
 we will showing CES a bid today. 
 You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.  I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct. 
 FYI 
 Robert, would you put these deals on the morning sheet please.  Thanks.  We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more. 
 Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions. This is how it will work,  Deal #  Comment 268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume should not change.   The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094.  This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.  Thanks 
 Oh be still my aching heart, filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff)  I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!! 
 I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems.  I will try again tonight.  It takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email. 
 Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's pricing.  TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.  I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it. 
 I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth to 95246 dth.  Please make the following change: Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.  Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify which price is correct.  The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April and CES is showing $.175.  Please verify which price is correct. 
 Do you need a HUG??    :o)

 Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.  I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;  Meter 4743 4747 4741 4754 4771 4753 4794 4728 4700 4749 4751 9740 6335 6333 4794 4700 4850 ISRP84 FSRP3 2SRP9   Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions. 
 Steve, I don't think you need to be at our meeting.  We have room 3125B at 1:30 PM tomorrow. 
 Kim, I need a room from 1:30pm to 2:30pm tomorrow.  Thanks 
 Hi gang.  I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal.  Around 1:30PM?  Let me know.  thanks 
 I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.  All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy. 
 Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks 
 I love my sweats.  Hows muffy? 
 Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers?  I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still.   Thanks. 
 I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.  There is no rush on setting these contracts up for Unify. 
 I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket?  Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on? 
 I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 (k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May.  Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May. 
 Hey, regarding deals 226462 and 258420, should we take the volumes to 0 on deal 226462? 
 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe that has already been done)?

 I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power.  Jim, Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with Ogy unless she is out.  But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes I make.  I humbly accept my position. 
 Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound correct to you?  Please let me know. chris 
 Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 1,210,121.  I will try to monitor the deal volume.  Thanks. 
 Scott, when would you like to go over the CNG scoop? 
 We sold 870/day starting 5/2 - 5/31 to CES for Timet.  The deal number is 257878 and the price is $3.4884 ($3.39 + $.0984).

 I think Alicia fixed this last week.  Take a look and let me know. 
 It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not working.  Take a look at deal 98243.  I just had to extend the date for May 31, 2000. 
 Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 (in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle. E Town N Jersey PSE&G Con Ed Lilco Bug Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco) Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)  Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.  Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.  Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream of Lambertiville. 
 CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000.  thanks

 "Moths"  A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making.  The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.  Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you naked?" he asks.  Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here and get ready to recieve you."  "Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."  He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands.  "Who the fuck are you?" the man asks  "I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with."  The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"  The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.  "Those little bastards!" *

 Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.  The correct contract is 560104 (deal 254262).  I just killed deal 231301.  thanks 
 Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.  I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point.  thanks

 ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.  Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I believe its in the deal correctly.  Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or something real intelligent like that.  This deal goes thru 2/28/01. 
 She's outta town. 
 You are the GREATEST!!!  Thanks for the book.  I'm going to do something nice for you someday,. 
 Please change the following deals to evergreen. Deals 231754 and 231748.   thanks 
 This capacity is in ENA's name and we have been billing CES the demand charge since January.  The MDQ is 2300.  Thanks Joanie! 
 Do you guys know which contract this is? 
 Tetco k#892722, deal 207137 was terminated eff 4/1/2000.  FYI 
 Lizy, I don't know how you see these the next morning.  Please check deals 252056 (primary) and 252057, I just set these up in Sitara.  This is a Tetco contract I forgot to set up in Sitara.  Thanks. 
 Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like. 
 The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555.  I created the deal with 0 volumes. 
 Thanks for the reminder.  I just faxed a confirmation for Dick Jenkins, Direcotor, Enron North America. 
 I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is $3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.  Thanks 
 This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part.  Thanks Brenda. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to ENA - Im Market East.  This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 77563)  Thanks.  I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000. 
 We have our CES/Bug contract for May.  The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract number is 893255. 
 Sorry, I sent this to you by mistake. 
 Just making sure everyone reads their emails.  The term is 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2001. 
 Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.  That should give us 812 day injected for May.  This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.  I knew we could deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May. 
 Ms.  Arnold called looking for the IF today.  She gets a much better response out of me than you do. 
 We have a new Cove Point Storage deal, here are the details; Term: 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2000 MSQ 360,000 MDWQ 36,000 Demand $.65 Demand Charge for April  $117,000.00 Demand Charge for May - March    $234,000.00/month Contract  FPS1024  The CPR storage injection deal is 246517, the withdrawal ticket is 249409.  I entered all the withdrawal volumes to come out of storage the last 10 days of March,. 
 UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify this information and let us know.

 My fault.  The numbers in yellow are estimates. 
 Ain't I just the nicest guy you know, MODEST TOO! 
 Did Tim and Dick ever chat about the FOM stuff??  What numbers should I be using now, FOM number, Volume sold back at Index Flat?

 Responses: 1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.  2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we are buying back gas at GD - $.01.  3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill CES directly for this?  4.  See attached worksheets.  5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab. Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she will recreate Jan - Mar.  6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has discussed this with Melissa. 
 I don't know a thing, but I think Mr. Goodell is an expert. 
 All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.  Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch with Don and Ernie today.  We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some March) invoices. 
 Each month, Ed Glaum with CES in Herndon needs an invoice copy of the BUG release to CES.  Please send him the Feb and Mar activity.  His phone number is 703-561-6472, his fax number is 703-561-7317.  You and I may need to chat. 
 I added all of these demand charges as "Actual" expense items to the 2000ces03 worksheet.  k#892722 - You De Woman!!!  k#892069 - added to deal 143316 k#892066 - added to deal 143315 k#892084 - added to deal 143318 k#892085 - deal 143319 k#892590 - deal 245855 - added to CES worksheet. 
 You may not see this deal come through the normal process.  Please set up deal 245855.  Thanks   Brenda, this is for Tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me. 
 We don't have a time frame and I have told her we need to sell the cows and the tractor. 
 Hi gang.  Lunch with CES is on Wednesday, that day works better with Jeff. 
 Hey, thats Mr. Turd to you. 
 I love being a MAN!!!  Ain't life great? 
 Joanie found the email from CALP stating they did receive the wire payment. Robin called Roman and gave him the info.  thanks Joanie. 
 This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.  Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on.  Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give Mark a copy.  Thanks. 
 Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice.  Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 Sched Fee  $20,000.00  I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice. 
 Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.  AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that number. 
 Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.  I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What do you guys think? 
 According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?  thanks 
 I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM..  I though you might be asleep. 
 Seen this one? 
 Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets. According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4.  I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.  I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge. 
 Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com.  Thanks 
 What happens if we sell CES spot gas??  It would be fixed price.  Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals.  What do you think?? 
 I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.  I should have February to you by next week some time. 
 Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other.  Thanks 
 Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez?  Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban, he was impeached. 
 Hey gang, the room number has changed to 3084. 
 FYI 
 What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today? 
 The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.  This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals.  Which brings up the following issues; *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility. Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.  * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?  * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals  I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.  Thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 Could you get Terry authorization to path in Unify please?  Thanks 
 Hey gang.  Joanie is still working on current day activity.  Joanie, please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447.  I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day. 
 Please reserve a conference room for up to 7 people for 1 hour on Wednesday, April 12th around 2:30pm.  thanks 
 OK.  Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in Unify with a zero volume. 
 Don't I always get back to you within 10 min???? 
 uhhh - ok  <=== see no caps. 
 NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract. 
 Chewies on the way!!!! 
 Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though. 
 My worked.  How many times a week did you put down? 
 I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify.  The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS schedulers.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm.   Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.  Please let me know if you will be attending.  I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending. 
 Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes are on "Sheet 1". 
 I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb.  They have a little comment on their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet.  Give me a call once you get these.  cg 
 Hey Sparky!  FYI. 
 Hey gang.  Dan caught my mistake.  Tenn fuels change in April.    March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.17%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9327 
 Hey guys.   I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I found.  The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom. 
 This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.  Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.  2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.  Comments/questions? 
 I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd.  Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar.  thanks 
 Hey guys.  I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever addressed.  Comments? 
 Not bad.  Went to a John Zurita fish fry.  I rode to John's house with a power guy that lives in my complex and we stayed about 1 1/2 hours longer than I wanted to .  Live and learn.  Ankle is doing ok.  I wear an ankle brace and tennis shoes to work.  I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow.

 Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.  I have a lunch meeting with CES and I will call you after lunch.  I do have the fax you sent.  What is you phone number? 
 I have my 1st therapy (physical not mental) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours.  Matt, why don't you go in my place, that sounds like it is going to hurt..  However, Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller cubes now.
