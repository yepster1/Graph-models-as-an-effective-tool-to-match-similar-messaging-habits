 Max, would you call Tiffanie Wheeler at Reliant to discuss the volume discrepancy on 2/27/02.  Her number is 713-207-6790.  I believe she said that if we provide them with pipeline support from Tallahassee, they will adjust our bill.  Thanks.  Keep me posted. 
 She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

 thx 
 does that mean we don't have to count half day tomorrow or all day Friday then I'm even? 
 Don't lie to me.  I know you didn't read the "fine print"  where you are taking everyone in your shop out for a free lunch.

 Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice. 
 Melissa verified our payment on Friday so that makes our estimated current cash balance is $61,790.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow. 
 FYI 
 Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.  She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.  Let me know if you have any comments / concerns.  Thanks. 
 Leon Payne, Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.  That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.  They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.  Don't know if that's it or not.   The lease at the tower is up ?next year? I think.  The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.  If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere. 
 Priscilla said Mid American just called her and said they won't pay us until they receive an invoice.  Have you pathed this yet?  Let me know.  thx 
 Hi Jon.  We just spoke on the phone and I work with Ruth Concannon and Maria Garza on the Enron Estate Team.  I'm trying to calculate the demand charge on the following capacity release  Offer #20275 Released to Enserco Term	4/8/02 to 4/30/02 MDQ	20,0000 demand rate  $1.30  Please call me when you get a chance at 713-853-4743.

 I'll copy you, but it is Ponderosa sending out the bills correct? 
 I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls, an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details; Price:		$2.25 Volume:	1,121,702 Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1  Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC? 
 I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?  Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west. 
 Who and where are they located? 
 Judy is going to send you an email.  I don't know what they changed to. 
 Doesn't look like tickets were ever entered in the system.  I've requested access to change the tickets.  I'll send a new email once I enter the deal.  Thanks  Let me know if you see any other missing items too. 
 Thanks 
 How much should we sell for Sat - Mon?  thx 
 Oh yeah, I'm looking good now.  I found some 5 year old "Tan in a Can" and spread it all over.  It caused a small rash in a couple of spots but I brushed those up in the photo. 
 Would you see if we sent out an invoice for deal 384258 to Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. for December 2001 and January 2002?   And if we did, did they pay it?  Thanks 
 http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ENA/livelink.exe?func=ll&objtype=141&objaction=browse  Let me know if this works. 
 You better believe it.  I'll bring my photos for the "magazine" shoot. 
 Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email. 
 I'll be taking off the 1/2 day next Tuesday April 16th and all day next Friday April 19th unless someone has pressing needs.  Kathy Kelly will be backing me up on all gas activity next Friday. 
 im an email mo fo.  whatever that means 
 Suzanne, give them Priscilla's number or my number.  Priscilla is at 713-345-3736 and my number is 713-853-4743.  thanks 
 When you get the price for the 10,000 dth we are selling you for Friday, would you send it via email.  I forward that info to 3 different people.  Thanks 
 Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00.  We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th.  Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.  Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.  My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.  I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file. 
 My girlfriend and I are having a baby soon.  The due date is May 7th.  I have some questions regarding what my insurance and benefit options are.  Would you tell me who I should speak with please?  Thanks Chris

 Do you see any payables to Elvis Energy? 
 Don't know about this but I am handling the activity for the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. (a.k.a. Cleburne Plant, a.k.a. Tenaska Power Partners) on Lone Star Pipeline.  We have a large imbalance on the transport contract that I'm slowly working off but that's about it.  Are you guys aware of any storage?  I'm going to call Joe Parks later and see if he was working on anything related to storage other then Centana.  I also have a contact at  Lone Star that I could ask but I rather see if what we know form the inside first. 
 I'm not aware of anything like that.  I'll ask around.

 Just the East for April please. 
 I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify.  BUT, Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them.  I believe they were called Service P&L reports.  The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges.

 David is going to send us an email with as much information that he can remember regarding the storage contract on Dominion, including any lawyers EES worked with back in December. 
 I just got Iris's voicemail.  She is on vacation until tomorrow.  I'll give her a call in the morning. 
 You were on the phone when I came by so I left the TXU shipper imbalance statement in your inbox this morning before lunch.  This is for gas being delivered to the Cleburne plant. 
 Melissa just confirmed that Reliant received ENA's wire last Thursday.  Thanks Melissa.  Tallahassee requested 0 volumes for tomorrow so our current cash balance is $66,270.00.  Thanks. 
 This is the info I gave El Paso.  Its probably ok to use this. 
 anytime i say "jump" phil and larry say "HOW HIGH" which is the way it should be.  now, somebody fetch me a diet coke!! 
 Susan,  I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may be a non event.  CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi, Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never know.  His number is 713-230-7205.  Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with a pregnant girlfriend.  later chris 
 we've been trying to sell about 5000 of imbalance gas a day.  lone star is aware of it and approves. 
 ship it to the plant 
 I don't think I ever had the invoices.  All I had were the statments showing the balance in the park and loans. 
 we have been selling txu 10,000 day on lone star since the 1st.  for tomorrow we are selling them 6,000 instead of 10,000 
 I sold 6,000 dth to TXU at $3.18 for tomorrow. 
 Ruth, remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's office last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham  Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word? 
 My last email on Sonat Park and Loan. 
 thanks 
 ahhh just like a woman.   although i have many of those sensitive feeling you know. 
 I got mine marked.  Thank you for inviting me you sweet sweet sweet person!!!!!!!!! 
 For tomorrow, should I wear a suit OR khaki's with a dress shirt OR khaki's with a dress shirt, tie and navy jacket?   This is my info for tomorrow.  CMS Energy Meet with Curt Lizzy and Del Blom on Friday April 5 at 12:30 Curt's number is 713-230-7205 Go to the 28th floor and ask for an hr rep.  1021 Main St, Suite 2800 Houston, TX  77002

  FYI 
 Good thing you mentioned that.  I can see that the attachment on this email is different than the one I sent before.  I will be sending out another email this afternoon just introducing the "Enron" team to each other.

 check on getting some gas medicine from the drug store, its over the counter stuff for babies. 
 I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.  Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.  Thanks  I'm taking off Friday. 
 FYI, MCV swing activity on Trunkline, not ANR.  Monday, March 19th was the last conversation we had with MCV regarding this swing gas. 
 You are my hero buddy.  And you think I should get married?   FYI  while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.  Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.  Hmmmm.   Take care and best of luck to you and the family. 
 The prepay to Reliant for Thur April 4th is $37,000.  I left the Cash Request on Doug's desk. 
 Our current cash balance after purchasing gas for the 4th is $43,350.  I've requested a prepayment of $37,000 to be wired tomorrow afternoon.  Have a good day! 
 ok 
 When she refinances, will your name be taken off the loan on the house? 
 Joe went to work for Bridgeline yesterday. 
 I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.  Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.  I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.  Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.  thx chris 
 Hey buddy, please include Kathy on you distribution in the future.  thanks 
 Hey, buddy.  I hope things are going well with you.  The pipeline is the place to be these days.  I appreciate the emails of the imbalance statement.  Would you send the hard copies to the following address please.  Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, LTD. C/O Enron North America Attn:  Theresa Vos ECN 1005 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX  77002  Just in case you need it.  Her number is 713-345-8173.   Thanks. 
 I walked to the park yesterday and didn't see you.  It was such a bummer.  Today is Eirc's last day, sniff sniff.  It was good seeing you.  Take care. 
 Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.  Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do you think?  ?	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team. ?	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.  Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.  Thanks 
 Got it.  Thanks 
 Beginning Wednesday, April 4th, El Paso will be taking 3,373 Dth per day from DRN #716, contract #101067.  El Paso will scheduling the gas on contract #5207.  Thanks everyone.  Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax  713-646-3059 
 Let me know if you get this.  thanks 
 Probably not.  I'll introduce myself to Theresa later this week. 
 They are starting on the 4th.  I thought I told him the 3rd but I may have made a mistake.  My fault.  Thanks 
 No buddy.  Thank you.  And I'll take you off campus for lunch next week too.  My treat.  Maybe I'll invite my work wife, Judith.  I'm thinking about Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop.  I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.  Of course you have a say, a small one anyway. 
 I'll check on it. 
 713-646-3059 
 i cannnot make an upward eye roll, and i can't help if my eyes look beady all the time. 
 I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.  Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?  Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.  I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60. 
 I'm not actively seeking another job and I believe I'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year.  But, I still need a backup for the gas activity.  Unless you tell me to do something different, I'm going to see if Kathy Kelly wants to back me up. 
  ENA has an approximate cash balance of $58,000 with Reliant after purchasing the 2,000 dth for tomorrow.  Melissa verifed receipt of the $1.7 million wire made last Thursday.  THANKS MELISSA!!  Let me know if anyone has questions. 
 It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.  Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of? 
 Would you see if we sent out invoices our if someone at Enron requested that no invoices be sent out.  Thanks 
 Hey woman!!  How are things going?  Happy with the job?  Happy with the man?  Be carefull, something happened to my woman and she has a really big stomach. 
 I'm just glad you are working today.  Makes me feel good. 
 I'm LOOOOOKING!!!! 
 I don't see the upward eye roll that all women are so good at.  I can even see my daughter practicing it when I feed her. 
 You are a stud 
 What is our Dominion status? 
 I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions.  Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?  Scott, I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ?flash? maybe and trying to correct a few things.  I'm not sure what the process is now.  Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items?  By the way team, Scott is out till next week. 
 FYI 
 Thanks.  You too!! 
 These are all the people I have been working with lately. 
 I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.  The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.  I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00. This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000). 
 Hi team.  Here is my new cell phone number, 832-867-3346.  I just changed it in People Finder so it may not show up until tomorrow. 
 Should I cancel the wire that is scheduled to go out today?  It might be too late but I can check. 
 I wonder if HR changed this holiday schedule over the last couple of months?  Let's ask Kathy, she will know. 
 I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.  Ed, I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting.  This was just in case you had the same question. 
 Looks good to me.  First word of second para - Ever or Even? 
 I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.  Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00  Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00  Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract 10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00  Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00 
 I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion.  Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00  Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00  Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract 10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00 
 Will do.  Thanks for the info. 
 You are my hero.  I am going to have a 2 day backup plan just in case Dominion doesn't deliver any gas. 
 Done with these.  Is there another list?  I can't remember. 
 Louis Dicarlo said you should chat with Sara Shackleton about the Dominion ISDA agreement.  BUT you may already be doing that. 
 I'm keeping this file here ==> o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/transportation/appalachain Producers

 I posted the April TW capacity.  11:50 AM  left a voicemail for Russell Williamson at BP Amoco  11:52 AM left a voicemail for Robert Eason at Burlington  Julie Reames is on maternity leave for 12 weeks . 
 Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.  This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.  Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair. 
 Barbara was going to tell you that I called.  I'm going to get my morning diet coke and I would like to see the name that lady gave us last night that might have some daycare info.  later gator jethro 
 http://homeadvisor.msn.com/pickaplace/comparecities.asp?TS=UT&selFS=TX&selTS=UT&selFC=0&selTC=0&PFC=Houston&PTC=San%20Francisco&EarningFromCity=50000&PFS=TX&PTS=CA 
 In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.  Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do. 
 I still don't have access to West (deal 1198936).  I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal.  When I book my deals on Trunkline for April, should I use Central?  We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April.  I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that. 
 I will be increasing my prepays to Reliant this week to cover any swing activity on the MCV Trunkline deal.  I have changed the "est cash flow" tab in the Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow file. 
 I'm not sure.  9:12 AM - I left a message for Brian Lamb at Columbia Gulf. 
 FYI, ENA has (or had) about 50,930 of primary receipts at Venice. 
 I mean Susan.  I assume you are talking about Susan Pereira. 
 i took the test and this is what it said. colors green blue yello purple red black white orange You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard. You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure. Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being. You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'. You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them. Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.  Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them. 
 Daniel, these are the notes I took from Friday's floor meeting.   Dan Leff floor presentation on Friday March 22nd, 10:00 AM came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.  we have about 1,000 people left in wholesale and retail about 800 people in support groups we've lost about 7,000 people since Dec 2nd.  3 things 1.  where is the business now we know where we are, where we are going, retention\ pooled wholesale and retail resources figure out how to get the people together  we've completly revamped the sr management team target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value. $3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth. stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.  2. we are important, the people that is all the difficult times are behind us he understands our urge to leave take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.  retention plan should be presented next week, will be filed next week with the bankruptcy court. creditor's committee has approved the retention plan  plan brings substantial amount of money to bear jobs may change email will go out next week detailing plan management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers   Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.

 Hey, do you mind if I send her an email with all the stuff attached?  You are my hero.

 Prepayment and gas flow activity through Monday March 26th.  I have added 2 new members to the team, welcome Melissa and Sheeley.  Feel free to hit Jim Taylor up for a free lunch. 
 I just deleted something you emailed me on March 20th or 21st.  I think it might have been related to Columbia gas but I'm not sure. 
 Prepay for Dominion for April 2002 to be made on Friday, March 29th.  I printed out the attached form and gave it to Doug Sewell.  Prepay amount = 10,000 dth per day x 30 days x $2.1562 = $646,860.00 
 The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.  For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."  The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."  Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."  Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them. 
 Ruth, use this as a starting point for the payment to Tennessee.  Make sure you copy Magaret Dhont and Rita Wynne on this. 
 I will be available by 9:05 AM.  I have to buy gas around 9 am every morning. 
 I am releasing the Boston Gas capacity on Iroquois (k#125008) and Tennessee (k#29667) for April to Boston Gas.  I am releasing the capacity prearranged, subject to bid, minimum bid of 100% of max rate with Boston Gas as the prearranged bidder.  Bidding will end on Monday, March 25th.  Submitted Iroq offer #50169 on 3/21/02 Submitted Tenn offer #29667-6 on 3/21/02 
 With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go.  No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.  Ed 
 I think you will be happy with me.  I believe I was able to release the capacity for April under offer #50169. 
 thx, looks like its working.  it probably already worked.  i just forgot to use the icon you set up for me.  i'll send you another nasty email next month. 
   Greg We've chatted before but you may not remember me.  I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.  Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.  I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.  Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas.  Thanks  Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax  713-646-3059

 I can't believe it.  I'm having the same trouble again this month.  I use this board about twice a month. 
 I don't use the start menu to access my pipeline EBB which is what I think this is.  But I do go to this website on the internet ==>    http://escript.dom.com/  to access the Dominion EBB.  Dominion used to be called CNG. 
 I have confirm letters on my desk.  Should I send those to you? 
 I have an event that I need to attend tomorrow afternoon so I will be taking the half a day off starting at lunchtime.  I will send out a plan of action for Trunkline this afternoon.  IF anyone needs me you can page me at 877-498-5497 BUT do not leave a voicemail, I don't know how to retrieve them. 
 Sure.  I have one gas purchase that I make right before 9:00 AM every morning but I can be there at 9:05 AM or later. 
 ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.  Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.  Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation. 
 Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin.  We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel, outside counsel (which is seperate), and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone.  I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts. 
 I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following;  Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment 1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved 1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved 1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved 1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan. 1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved 1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.  I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.  Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes. 
 You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS.  Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk ( I thought) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it.  I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara.  Sitara deal #1198936 is an example.  Can you help get me access? 
     It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd get  to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does for a  living.  The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."  The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."  Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease dancer in a cabaret for gay men."  The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar  He blushed and said, "I'm sorry but my dad is an  1) auditor for Arthur Andersen  OR  2) a trader for Enron   and I was just too embarrassed to say so." 
 actually, could you or Kathryn send Shemin 5 Dominion producer contracts.  Just any 5 will do.  She just wants to get a feel for what these contracts look like. 
 Cool. 
 Shemin, just give me a call when you are ready.  I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office. 
 I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00 or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some of those letters you are talking about down below.  Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.  Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can decide if you want to come.  Thanks 
 My Tenn emails from way back. 
 I have requested a wire to Reliant for Thursday in the amount of $30,000.00.  Thanks. 
 WOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,   Daddy's getting a new Blue Wave Bay boat!!!!   WOOOHOOOO 
 Prepay amount for tomorrow is $30,000.00.  I gave Doug the hard copy of the wire request.  Thanks team. 
 Another interesting item.  Call me when you get a chance. 
 I have a bill from Cingular Wireless in my iPayit account.  I called Cingular and asked them when this bill was last paid.  They said before Dec 2nd.  I told them they should cancel the service.  Don't know if they are going to do that or not.  8:25 am Per Lisa at Cingular WIreless, this account has been cancelled. 
 Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas.  Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month.  Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available.  Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation. 
 This has not been a good informative day.  We just need to chat with Dominion to figure out how the contracts work and for me to find out more info the storage contracts. 
 Max, I forgot all about you needing this.  I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days. This is what I have done so far. 
 Where are you located?  I'll come by to get them after I go to the credit union. 
 Gloria is out sick but she's checking her voicemails.  I'm meeting with Wade at his desk at 1:30 today and Gloria is going to call us.  We should be able to figure out how the contracts work then Wade and I can meet with you this afternoon when you become available.  I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all. 
 stacy.dickson@enron.com  Thanks 
 Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service.  Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do.  Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket?  Also, when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system?  thx 
 I need to get copies of all the invoices for Dominion for ENA, VNG, and EES for Nov-01 through current please.    thanks chris x3-4743 Fax 713-646 
 Just put the survey on the fax. 
 Thanks for the info.  I'm looking for a Dominion/Escript ID and password next please. 
 Silly me.  I goofed, I had the wrong beginning balance in my worksheet.  Currently looking at sending out $30,000 on Thursday. 
 Sounds good.  I believe Alain is out till Thur and I hope we meet before then. 
 Hey there team.  We are starting to focus on Dominion pipeline and I need your help explaining the process to Shemin.  I would like to set up a meeting with Gloria, Wade, Shemin, Kathryn as soon as possible. 
 i guess you don't have msm Messenger do you. 
 ima dominion stud 
 We are having dinner with Suzanne this Thur if that's ok with you.  I think you and I should register at the hospital tonight or tomorrow night if possible. 
 I'm estimating a $50,000 prepay to Reliant this Thursday.  Cash is up $.20 from Friday.  I may need to make the prepay on Wed again.  I'll have a better idea after 9:00 AM tomorrow. 
 look here billy bob, i send it to you just so's you can see who else i send it to.  i think i'll keep sending it to you and i think you will like it!!  now go fetch me a diet coke and make sure you clean the top of the can too! 
 Excellent notes.  Thanks 
 Ok, put me down for 4 Chic Fil A's ($20.00). 
 Recommendation for ENA Pools 1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition. 2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow 3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.  I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following. 1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket. 2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition. 3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.  Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.  Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.  Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.   3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of 11/30/01	12/31/01 Gath North		1,323		2,187 Tran North		0		0 Gath South		(26,482)		31,583 Tran South		5,412		8,143  Cumulative		(19,747)		41,913   Dominion IF Prices Mar 2002	$2.59 Feb 2002	$2.20 Jan 2002	$2.79 Dec 2001	$2.42 Nov 2001	$3.37 Oct 2001	$2.02 Sep 2001	$2.42 
 Thanks Max.  Per our discussion today I requested 64,000 dth per day from Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc.  I spoke with Carl Haugneland and I faxed him a copy of the attached letter and excel worksheet.  Joe, I am mailing a copy of the letter with attachments to you.  Thanks. 
 thx buddy 
 Hey buddy.  I'm going to another meeting.  Don't forget to send me the worksheet.  Thanks 
 Mark is our "hired" special bankruptcy attorney who works on transportation and storage.  Enron goes to him to get expertise on how to handle the pipeline contracts.  Shemin Proctor is like an Enron staff attorney specializing in transport. 
 Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,  1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth) 2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth 3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1) 4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.  Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.  Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did. 
 3/14/02 9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.  Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.  Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas. 
 sorry, not till i hear from legal but we probably won't pay the invoice.  as of right now, don't pay the invoice. 
 nope 
 Hey team.  ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.  I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.  Christina, tomorrow morning, call Jim Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If Jim isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing Jim up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.  Have a good weekend! 
 Do you still chat with Nelson?  GO BUDDY GO!

 Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.  ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;  1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424. 2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok? 3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat. 4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).  Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.  All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.   Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.    2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.  Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.  Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.  Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.  2/20/02 Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.  2/25/02 Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract. 1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.  3/11/02 Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.  3/13/02 Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream. 3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out. 3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department. 
 I need to go get a beer with Jim for a little while.  Is that ok? 
  Ask Marvin or whoever looks at Tenn if they are interested in any Iroq / Tenn capacity.  The capacity goes from Tcpl/Iroq - Wadd to Iroq/Tenn - Wright, then from Iroq/Tenn - Wright to Mendon and Boston Gas citygate. 
 I've never talked to Ed about any of this.  I just sent him this email the day you and I spoke.  You might forward this on to him with your comments. 
 I need steve's email address.  Do you have it?

 Prepay amount for tomorrow is $25,000.00.  Thanks Team. 
  Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way? 
 Give me your fax number and I'll fax it over.  Doug Sewell said he would not pay for it as ENA and I don't know enough about the deal to argue with him.  I've pasted in Richard's response is in black below. 
 YES.  I think we spent an hour and half at ??babie r us on hwy 59 sunday.  Didn't know if i was going to survive. 
 Sure.  I'll have Ingy wash and polish it first. 
 I'm waiting to hear from Rita.  I'll definitely let you know what happens.  thanks. 
 I don't know if I sent you guys this small humble list of things the baby will need.  Its down below with blue web links. 
 Necessary items for the baby are down below with blue web links. 
 Sempra needs to get a copy of the court order authorizing ENA to enter into GISB's and transactions.  Does such a thing exist that we can send to Sempra?  Thanks 
 Could you get me the Inside Ferc file for June 2002 please?  Thanks

 Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.  I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?  Thanks  Chris L. Germany Phone 713-853-4743 Fax  713-646-3059 
 Probably spending the night there.  You should go and have a goooood time. 
 These days, its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new GISB than to find any of the existing documents.  The attached document is for Enron North America Corp.  David is going to see if they can use it.  If your legal department approves, please print 2 originals, fill in the Sempra information, sign it, and send it to me.  Thanks  Chris L.

 Yesterday I asked you how to go about paying an invoice from Peoples Energy for $1,380.44.  The charges are for a license fee, a customer service, and an outstanding balance of $983.75.  I found out this morning that we are using this system to do nominations for Enovate.  Eric Boyt said he thought the Enron people managing the Enovate deal are Beth Jenkins and J.O. Pagan.  Should I forward this invoice to Beth or J.O.? 
  Updated schedule through Wednesday 3/13/02. 
 Ruth, I SEE YOU ON THE PHONE OVER THERE.  Probably with Shemin too!  Shemin, I'm sending this to you company email and your Enron email.  Do you use the Enron email system?  Wade said he just received a call from Gary Novenski? at DRI.  Gary was asking Wade if he had any new information.  I'm waiting for Steve Stonestreet to call me back so I can learn how to run all of these reports.  Wade is making copies of the reports he has to give to Ruth. 
 Is this a new contract on our side to send to them for review? 
 Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.  Thanks 
 I'm going to work out after work today.  Should be home around 6-6:30

 Do you have Heidi or Jim's number.  They left EES. 
 Do you have a phone number for Heidi?

 Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.  Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.  Thanks 
 Are you going to San Antonio Friday?  Is the little woman going with you - maybe make it a romantic encounter?

 I received your fax.  Questions:  at the top of the page from Dominion, it states that "effective FEBRUARY 2002 Production ... WILL NOT BE CREDITED".  One of the column titles on the sheet is EFFECTIVE DATE.  What does this effective date stand for.  Also, were you able to find a contract for The Central Pacific Group? 
 Let me know if you get this.  Outlook is up but I don't have any email for today which is odd. 
 I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston Gas.  He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.  Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.

 This is my Reliant Energy schedule.  I send this to all the people you see below at least twice a week.  I'm only doing business with them at one point and they are making money off Enron.  But he has agreed to give me a little operational flexibility over the weekends if I need it.  I send them a wire every Thursday, unless its like this week where prices ran up and I had to send it on Wednesday. 
 I have asked my legal department about this a couple of times and I'm not sure if we have sent you anything.  Would you please just send me a GISB agreement out of your shop.  I see you have spoken to EES already.  Thanks Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax  713-646-3059 
 Galveston sounds good to me. 
 I sent you the fax yesterday.  It really looks like all the contracts were terminated effecitve 12/31/2001 to me. 
 Shemin and I are going to lunch on Monday.  She might even PAY!!!!!  I told her I was going to bring 12 of my closest friends.  Well, I don't have any friends but I told her that you two might like to go. 
  Have a good weekend! 
 Steve and I were talking about where to go.  We don't know where yet but I bet we figure it out.  Judy may come with us.  I say goodell coming in this morning and I told him we didn't want him to go.  YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I REALLY LOVE BESIDES MYSELF IS FOOOOOOOOD!!!!! 
 Are you getting these? 
 Wade, what are the contract numbers that the producer's gas gets allocated too? 
 The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.  This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today.  The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.  The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.  The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.         The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.  ENA is agent for both of these companies. 
 I believe CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company should be added.  Per Sylvia's notes, the contact their is Tim Spurlin.  His number is 713-230-7427.  I have not contacted CMS about being added to the list.

 3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell him.  This was an ENA deal. 
 Would get a folder and make a lable for the following please?  I don't know if you are putting supply or market on these lables or not.  TDC Energy Corporation Contract 96029072 
 I just sent this to goodell so i wanted you to see what i got for Immer.  got a basket with a bunny in it, a big butterfly looking thing, a snickers bar, 2 caramel eggs, a baby binky, a mini mm candy dude - green, a double phone jack.  and seperately, a tiger (pooh) hand puppet.  phone jack is for me but im putting it in the basket.   so im gonna put her pedicure gift certificate at urban retreat in the easter basket.  i also got a happy b-day mylar baloon. 
 Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?   Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day 28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00 
 maybe i should go with you to get the carport.

 I thought of a screwdriver and blue. 
 Shemin, Kathryn (EES Logistics) is going to send me some information on EES. I'm going to summarize the date for ENA and EES and resend this email, hopefully within the next hour or so. 
 Kathryn, add whatever comments you have especially the one about going back to sep, then i'm going to rewrite this email and send it out to all these people down below.             Kay, who should I work with at Weil? Jeff, Loretta, are you the right contacts for me at PwC? Shemin, my first queston for you is will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January)? Kathryn, what are the imbalances for EES on 11/30/01  I've added Kathryn Bussell to the list.  Kathryn is over the EES Logistics group.  EES has been signing some of the producer letters allowing the producers 
 Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.  Questions that need to be answered, ** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier? ** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?    The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.    3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of 11/30/01	12/31/01 Gat North		1,323		2,187 Tran North		0		0 Gat South		(26,482)		31,583 Tran South		5,412		8,143  Cumulative		(19,747)		41,913 Dom Inside Ferc		$3.37		$2.42 
 I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas.  He will do a conference call with us tomorrow.  I told him it would probably be around our lunch time.  He said that is fine.  I can set up a time tomorrow.  His boss, Jeanne Adkins, told him she doesn't need to be there if we are just talking about the mechanics of how the producer gas flows. 
 Shawn seems like a nice person.  You should take her out to eat then I'll take you out to eat. 
 ok, now i feel like i'm doing somethig worthwhile. 
 Hey, I think you are the only person that doesn't delete this right away. 
 I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due the rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary" tab to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any information that identifies the wire.  Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me to add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.  That's what I plan to do. 
  Moved the prepay to Wednesday.  The amount is $42,000.00 due to the spike in pirces. 
 Per my discussion with Sherry Glazebrook at Tennessee, she wasn't real specific since I don't have an EES ID on Tennessee but this is what I found out.  CONTRACTS  Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)  This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816.  This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas. Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company   All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable.  In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues. Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT) Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)  Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If Enron is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that Enron is still using this agreement? 
 Please take away my access.  And I believe the following people are no longer with Enron, Martin Cuilla, Brad McKay, Denver Plachy, Sylvia Pollan, and Kevin Ruscitti.  Thanks

 Steve is working with the admins to see who needs what, CQG, Reuters,..... things like that. 
   Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. One other thing... We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. Anyway, as I was saying... Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week. 
 Cash prices have jumped over $.20 since Friday.  I may need to make my prepayment on Wednesday for Reliant and I've bumped up the amout to $42,000 for this week.  I will have a much better idea by 9:00 tomorrow of course. 
 I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.  If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.  I get the estimated prices from Jim.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.  Thanks 
 The tariff sheets do not line up on the page so well, I did a cut and paste.  You should see the following sheets  No		Comment		File 28B		PAL Rates		CGAS_PAL_rates.doc 227-229		Rate schedule		CGAS_PAL_Tariff.doc 
 Cash till Williams does a little better.   I'm swinging back to pizza now. 
 I did submit a request via "e Request" - #83213.  I didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and I don't know HOW you would do that either.  I just asked for everything to cover all the bases. 
 I applied for the Origination - Wholesale position, job #1154 on the job posting board.  I would like to have the attached resume sent to the hiring manager as well please.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.  Thanks 
 I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP (tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not. 
 U de MAN.  thanks 
 I was getting an error messge until I downloaded something from the IOL Setup & Help tab. Now, I go to http://www.iroquois.com/igts/info/section-frame.html and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen. Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen. And this is where I used to get an error message, now I just get a small symbol - looks like some sort of "flash" plug in is not loaded. 
 Bernie said he has given Ed all the file locations and such.  I asked him to email you and I anything he thinks important. 
 Update schedule through 3/4/02.  Have a good weekend! 
 Goodell want phone numbers for the following WIlliams people.  Jon Warzel in Tulsa Thomas Coleman in Atlanta 
 I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.  Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.  I also left a message for the help desk about this. 
 FYI, I just bumped up the forecast for next week from $19,000 to $37,000 because Tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend.  I've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet. 
 of course, its my perrrrogative to changemy mind and go burger hopping. 
 Sounds like a pizza night to me. 
 I leaving for the day.  I'm going to drop by Shemin's office (if I can remember which one it is) and leave what I have on the contracts.  It's slow going because it takes a long time for the contracts to pop up on the screen. 
 Wonder where I should go to lunch today?  Maybe the BOOOOOFEEEEEET!!! 
 I still am unable to get into the EBB.  Did the capacity get awared to Boston Gas? 
 Ed is asking me if we followed up or if we need to follow up.  Please let me know.  I am also going to send you an email of the letter we sent to Tallahassee. 
 I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.  Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.  thanks 
 I'm actully working on this.  I should have it done tomorrow or Monday.  Thanks 
  Enbridge is going to send me an invoice tonight or tomorrow.  They have been sending us and invoice each month.  I'll get back to you.  I just know we owe money on this and I hope its not more than what we are making on the deal. 
 FYI:  Pipeline name change.  Not sure who this might impact.  At least I don't see any deals in Sitara on this pipeline.  There will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 PM. 
 done 
 This doesn't have everything on it AND i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it.  I want you to take a look and tell me what you think.  I actually think a summary thingy, sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week, would be easier to look at.  Give me your thoughts.

 I would like to set up a GISB agreement to trade with Sempra.  Could you send me one to send to Sempra please?  Thanks 
 Joe Van Zandt with Dominion Field Services wants to know if we are going to nominate his gas for the first.  Their are 3 fixed price deals and 1 Index + $.10 deal.  I can't find the deals in the system.  What should I tell him legally besides NO? 
 Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.  We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.  You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.  Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.  I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me. 
 yes sir 
 Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.  I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.  But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so. 
 Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.

 I misunderstood. I thought it was ok to pay based on my email from last week.  My contact at LD  (David Walker) asked me about this amount last week.  He didn't mention any other outstanding items. 
 I printed this out and gave it to Doug.  My prepay amount for Thur is $19,000.00. 
 You are welcome. 
 Updated schedule through Thursday, Feb 28th.  ENA will wire $19,000.00 to Reliant tomorrow afternoon. 
 Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that  Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.  Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?   Any comments or questions?

 Judy's Rob works at Lasco in Sugarland.  She said there are several of those in Houston. 
 Thanks for your help.  Now go find me a job. 
 Congratulations!!  I would walk over and hassle your "MAN" but I don't see him. 
 Just a reminder that we still need to discuss the physical deals with volumes in the sitara for March.  You said we were going to talk to Bob Hall about that today. 
 FYI, I'm sure these are not in the system yet but will be soon. 
 I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations  Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00 Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)  Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00  There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.  Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form? 
 I have an id - what kind of form are you talking about? 
 I know.  I'm gong to recommend zeroing out the deal in sitara under "expected volumes". 
 I did have those set up pretty quick. 
 I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!!!  We spent our first night together Friday night.  Of course we both have colds / allergies real bad so it was a sniffly experience.  It will take some getting used to thats for sure.  She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday, bless her pregnant heart.

 oh no, i insist that you do it since you started the process.  i'm such a laggard. 
 Hi team.  I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.  We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.  I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.  I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID? 
 Could you tell me who in legal is assigned to this?  thanks 
 Do you have a deal number for this gas? 
 I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.  I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.  Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines? 
 I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March. 
 According to Iroq the problem is on our side.  Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.  Following is the address that I'm starting at.  I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.  It should ask me for my ID and password.  I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk.  I'm out for the rest of the day.  Thanks  http://www.iroquois.com/igts/transportation/section-frame.html 
 never mind 
 Daniel, please get us a conference room for 30 min Monday afternoon and email everyone with the details.  Eric, you don't need to be there, I'm just keeping you in the loop. 
 Kay, per my voicemail, I need to meet with you, Ed, Shemin, and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline.  This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.  Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.  I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.  Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.  Thanks

 Updated schedule through Monday, Feb 25th. 
 anytime monday morning is fine with me, EXCEPT, i need to be at my desk around 9:00 AM to serve the Tallahassee deal.  It only takes about 5 min though 
 I am still having trouble but I don't know if its and Enron problem or an Iroquois problem.  I'm waiting to hear form Iroquois.  I would like you to check it out if you have time this morning. 
 The file you guys sent is July 2001!!  Let me know what rates you are looking at.  We didn't keep all of them updated and GRI changed effective 1/1/2002.  I did make some updates to this file.  Also, I only have rates for East Desk pipelines. 
 Robin is having back surgery next Thursday, Feb 28th.  She went to a neurosurgeon for a second opinion, Dr. Alfonso Aldama was her second opinion dude..  Dr. Esses, my second opinion dude, is an orthopedic surgeon.  And Dr.Alani, the guy I went to see first was an orthopedic surgeon.  Robin said I should go to a neurosurgeon.  What do you think? 
 I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.  Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations  Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422 Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)  Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554  As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week. 
 Tommy, I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine.  I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.  I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.  But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?  Thanks 
 That's fine.  I don't need AEP.

 I see job #1154 (Origination - Wholesale) on the job posting board.  I am going to apply for it online (hopefully today).  I thought you said yesterday that there are two postings for your area.  Do you know if it has been posted yet or are you using job #1154 to fill both positions?  Thanks. 
   Wade, 2 things, do you have any of the letters that the producers sent to Dominion, I would like one of those AND who are you talking to at Dominion?  Thanks 
 This is what I want to send to our "Team".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?   These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.  Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.    Chris's notes: Sonat Park & Loans  2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.  Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.  Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.  Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.  2/20/02 Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back. 
 I would like to have access to the following directory.  It has the actual Gas Daily prices loaded into excel files.  I'm not sure who you have to ask but they may not let me have it.  The directory is o:TDS/TDS Curve/East/    Let me know.  Thanks 
 You need to get on the email distribution for this.  I get emails from them every day. 
 Make Jim Taylor take you out to lunch sometime. 
 You are most welcome. 
 I've requested a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be sent tomorrow and I have that on my schedule. 
  I printed this out and gave it to Doug.  My revised prepay amount for Thur is $10,000.00. 
 I'm using March pricing for TCO and Sonat.  For TCO, I'm using the financial basis offer for March provided by Dan Junek at AES at 9:45 AM, $.125.  Sonat basis is not as liquid so I'm using the Inside Ferc differential for Feb 2002.  For Feb 2002, Henry Hub is $2.03 and Sonat is $1.99, ($.04).  At 10:00 AM, NYMX for March 2002 is $2.36  TCO Value	$2.485 = $2.36 + $.125  Sonat Value	$2.32 = $2.36 + ($.04) 
 I need Sitara access to all gas regions.  I'm trying to look at some of the Central Desk activity and I don't have authorization.  We might as well give me access to all ENA gas positions and the ability to create/update Sitara tickets for all gas regions. 
 I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.  Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days? 
 I'm moving into my new hugh apartment with my first roommate - have not had a roommate since March 1996. 
 POINTY HEAD!!!!!!     I KNEW IT!  Poor little fella.  I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible.  I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.  Talk about space, I GOT IT!  For now anyway.  Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.  Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.  I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.  Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.  The apartment is still pretty empty.  I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.  I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat..... 
  Don't send this out because its not complete.  I'll finish it tomorrow but I wanted you to have it in case I get hit by a bus or something.  good nite    Sonat Park & Loans  2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer at Sonat (205-326-2007) ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.

 This would be for gas ENA purchased from Sonat.  It's not transport related. 
 Bob Crites at El Paso Merchant Energy is interested in the Florida capacity as well.  I don't know how he relates to Grier Martin's group.  Bob's number is 713-420-2499. 
 The gentleman interested in our Florida space is Henry Barth with FPL Energy Services (the retail group, separate from the group Mike Jessop works for).  His number is 561-694-4057. 
 I finally got a response on the wire information.  You should be getting a call from Ramona Rodriquez in our Treasury department.  Let me know if you don't hear from her.  Thanks Chris 713-853-4743 
 Phil, I will drop my wire amount for Thursday if Tallahassee does not call on the gas next week.  I need to research how much gas Tallahassee has taken in the past on the swing contract. 
 Thanks, you too.  How do I get my fax number changed in the contract?  My current fax number is 713-646-3037. 
 Max, would you provide Phl with the amount of money we expect to receive for the Tallahassee swing gas for May please?  Thanks.  Also, let Phil know if there are any reductions on the baseload amounts too.  thanks 
 ENA did not purchase any gas for the weekend or Tuesday (Monday is an Enron holiday).  Have a good weekend! 
 Any news on this? 
 Congratulations.  Of course I won't be able to give you any more candy on valentine's day.  But maybe someone over there will take care of that. 
 Hey there.  I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment.  Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make.  I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet.  thanks.

 I just received a copy of the executed Reliant agreement today.  Do you want a copy?

 You still don't understand how things work.  You are suppossed to always have that info at my beck and call. 
 Robin needs a back doctor recomendation.  Who do you think she should see? 
  Ok, since I have not seen or heard from you, I'm tossing you nameplate.  Maybe my woman will let me put it up in the bedroom, the one we are moving into on Monday. 
 I've heard that there may be some job opportunities with Transwestern Pipeline.  They recently had an employee leave their marketing department.  I would like to talk to Kevin Hyatt and at least let him know that I may be interested in any future opportunities.  Would that be ok with you? 
 What's the status of my nephew?  Is he in Chicago?  Has he gone awol yet?    Subject: How to Explain Enron to Your Children  A variation of a folkloric explanation of economic systems  FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.  FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them, and sells you the milk.  COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbors help take care of them and you share the milk.  TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and denies they ever existed and drafts you into the army. Milk is banned.  CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.  ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.  P.S. When the sham is finally uncovered, you and the other executives siphon off all the companies assets, freeze the assets of the peons working on the farm, and then tell them that there is no use crying over spilled milk.

 What bears? 
 you don't have one here. 
  This prepay amount is on Phil's cash flow worksheet.  I'm requesting $26,000.00 to be wired to Reliant tomorrow and currently estimating $36,000.00 to be wired next Thursday.

 thanks 
 I'm trying to get in touch with Gerald Gilbert.  He started working there on 2/1 I think.  You may not know him but if you do, ask him to call me at 713-853-4743.  Thanks 
 Good idea.  I'm checking on it and I might add this info to the worksheet. 
 Who would have this info?  And it might be a good thing for me to add to the schedule.  Thanks 
 Hey team.  I would like to release the Iroq and Tenn capacity for March activity to Boston Gas by the end of the week if possible.  Please let me know by Thur morning if I should wait until next week.  Thanks 
 Steve Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is "attached" to the AS (aggregation service) contracts, and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract.  CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production. 
 37147	IPP agreement - our pooling contract. 39149  AS agreement - 66917  AS agreement -  I think the AS agreements are aggregation supply and I believe the wellhead meters were attached to these contracts to help with allocations and billing.  I not 100% sure so I left a message for our CGAS contact to verify. 
 Guess what?  I just hired some mover to move me next week.  Indrid keep telling me that you and I have bad backs and don't need to fool with moving furniture.  So, I hired movers.  They are charging me $60 hour and I figure 3 hours max. 
 Hopefully just once a week, every Thursday. 
 Let me know if you want to be added to this distribution list.  I should only send this list out 2 or 3 times a week now that we have a process down. 
 Sorry about the email I just sent at 10:49 AM.  Attached is my new schedule reflecting no gas flow on the 9th and 10th. 
 That would be great if you could tell me.  I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th, and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th.  I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.  Let me know.  You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday, enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days. 
 I would like for you to get 3 or 4 bids for the Iroq Zone 2 capacity.  And later, I may ask you to get bids for the Iroq/Tenn capacity. 
 Hey!  Congradulations on getting that new phone number.  I knew you could do it.  Would you ask Gerald Gilbert to call me when he gets a chance?  My number is 713-853-4743.   Thanks 
 I spoke with all the following personally about th
