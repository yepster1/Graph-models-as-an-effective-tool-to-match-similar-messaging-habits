 Commodity and fuel should be 0 going back into Texas Gas.  thanks cg 
 Hey buddy.  Please allocate the followin deals to 0 for the 9th only.  My mistake and I will owe you for life.  deal 720977, 720959, and 720986 
 I missed this.  Looks like IT will not flow through St 90 
 I think the pricing should be Trco Index plus commodity plus fuel.  It looks like you just have Index plus commodity on the pricing.

 I was going to call and harasses you but no one answered your phone.  I'm pretty sure my purpose on life is to make you miserable.  What do you think?  I will be out of the office this afternoon after 2:00 pm - Tenn shipper meeting. 
 According to somebody - housecats left outside kill over 1,000,000 tweety birds a day! 
 Brad McKay sold 33,000 dt of the Iroq/Wadd to the firm Canadian book for May and I just sold 9189 of the NFUL Niagara to the Canadian book at a +.29 for May.  On NFUL - I created deal 749380. 
 I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy  :) 
 The truth is out there! --  ------- Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day    Computer Gender  An English teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the English language; noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names, and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she." One of the students raised her hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"  The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups:  males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations.  The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.  2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.  3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem.  4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.  The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.  3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.  4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. 
 Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines? 
 Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.  Comments, questions? 
 She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.  I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck. 
 U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just kicked in somehow. 
 I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.  Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man? 
 I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email. 
 Ernie's on the team now. 
 You like (cat) attitude don't you?  And what makes you think my stomach is cushy?????? 
 Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV. 
 I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the following deals. Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.  Deal  Comment 473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections 473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.  Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan to Texas Gas ticket.  All of my information is on the following worksheet 0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested. 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?". That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!  What's up with you girl? 
 1.  May Only   $.4300 2.  May/Oct       $.4380 Jun/Oct         $.4400 Just wanted to show the diff between May and the rest of the summer.  Let me know how this looks.    3.  Nov/Mar  no offer 
 Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;  Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000? What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above? Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above? 
 This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.  Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money. 
 Did she show you her tatoo?  I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself. Your the boss, what do you think? 
 YES I AM.  What are the dates?  And I love your outfit today. 
 This isn't the right guy but he can get you to someone - Mike Garred x35488. 
 According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool 2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65  Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.  Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense? 
 I did vote for the new sports arena.  AND, I'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today.  I will wait till after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input. 
 Then try AEP in Columbus.  They have a big shop and you should know some of the people there. 
 Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston. 
 Please give Judy Townsend, Scott Goodell, and myself  the ability to trade the physical Canadian products.  We need to be able to see them on EOL.  Thanks 
 Hey there.  I was on vacation on the 9th.  I guess its ok to send out the invoice now. 
 Very funny! 
 You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.  Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.  Behave yourself girl. 
 Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.  See what you can find me.  I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.  Just came in to work for a few min.  Later. 
 This is how I priced the deal   Sandra's May-Oct physical Ela Basis offer was about ($.0725) The screen was aroung $5.30    NYMX   $5.30 Ela Bas is  (.0725)  Ela Price  5.2275 Variable   .4500  M2 Price  5.6775  M2 less NYMX  .3775 TP2 demand  .1000  Price to Customer .48  We would do this to the extent Judy could get the capacity. 
 I'm out next week.  Chat with Mr. Goodell if this comes up again. 
 We should probably look at this sounds like a Hattiesburgh type deal to me.   Gas Storage Facility to Be Sold Immediately  A natural gas storage facility in Monroe County, Mississippi which is ready to be built out is being offered to be sold immediately. It will be connected to Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern and others. It has 12 BCF of total storage capacity and 8 BCF of working gas storage, with HIGH deliverability. This project is worth considerably more than the $4.2 million asked by the owners, who need to sell it quickly.  The deadline for offers or serious interest is April 13, 2001. For more information on this gas storage facility please call (985) 893-9225. EFS Energy or write: storage@enerfax.com 
 Use "Sheet 3" on the attached file.  Page me at 1-800-978-1788 if you have questions. 
 Uhhh - NO.  I did clean the bathroom last nite.  I do that once every couple of months whether it needs it or not. 
 I added a couple of deals that will not show up until the morning.  If you could rerun this first thing tomorrow I would appreciate it.  Thanks 
 I'm done with March.  Take a look and let me know what you think. 
 Thanks for the card.  It was very nice. 
 Please bookout the following deals that I entered for 3/31/2001.  Match purchase deal 718081 with sales deal 718078.  I think this is my last New Power deal forever. 
 Getting short means I'm selling now - expecting the price to go down - and then buying. Getting long means buying now - expecting the price to go up - and then selling. I think you should be doing this with cattle futures.   Right now I down $290,000.00 for the day. 
 You are a good gradson.  I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma Monday night.  I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times if I had a girlfriend.  By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was married with 6 kids.  She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.  I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.  I got short around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.  Let's see - I've only lost $185,000.00 today.  Oh well, its just money I guess.  Its funny how unhappy that makes me.  I'm gonna go pout now.  Later 
 I don't have good numbers for the 30 or 31st yet but you I think everythink else is good. 
 Spoke to the tax lady today.  She mailed an extension for mine and my fathers taxes.  I just know you guys care.  I mailed all of Dad's tax stuff to her Sunday and she received it yesterday. 
 Good to go.  Thanks 
 Have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts?   Deal  contract 456640  894232 456762  894233 459025  894199 459064  894244 459070  894245 459216  894199

 https://mesa.altra.com/production/index.html 
 Spoke to Jay.  He's going to lunch with us. 
 Could you please re-send the Ogy invoice for March? 
 I'm going to see Mickey Mouse in Florida next week.  My brother is taking me since I have failed at obtaining a wife and kid(s). 
 Cool!!   I'll start cleaning my apartment.  Heck, I may even vacum!! 
 You De Man!!!! 
 It's missing the demand charge.  I'll get you to rerun it for me in the morning and see if the demand charge shows up. 
 Russ, could you kill this deal please?  I keep getting a weird message when I try to kill it. 
 Please send me the Ogy invoice for March.  I did such a good job of doing my job that I think everything in the system is ok.  By the way - I'm on vacation for a week or so startig Friday.  I should have New Power updated by tomorrow. 
 Great, exactly what I needed. 
 The password is 2001tran04 
 Hey buddy, how about the CGAS Gas Daily's for March 2001? 
 I just noticed, do you want my Bid or my OFFER? 
 R U still in the office??????   Call me!! 
 I think you should attempt to call me.  You may be detained at some point. If I don't hear from you by 7:40 PM then I go home.  If I don't hear from you by 8:15 PM then me go to bed (and not with you). 
 I may have to get with you in the morining on this. 
 For tomorrow, I believe I'll work out tomorrow after work and I should still be back at my desk by 6:30 pm.  Just in case, my pager number is 877-498-5497.  BUDDY!@!!! 
 Would you see how much vacation I have taken for the year please.  I took my floating holiday and 1/2 day of vaca on my last time sheet. 
 713-646-8453 
 I wanted to send you this email before I deleted it.  Everything may have been taken care of already. 
 I can't see what you have in the 5th column.  Buy, if the all meters on the pipe are marked at TGT/ZSL then that tells me what I need to know. 
 I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I asked her to call me back. 
 Hey Buddy!!!!  Wrong worksheet. 
 Rate effective 4/1/2001  Total Transportation Rate                       18.61 ?/dt Fuel Cost                                            1.89 % Effective: April 1, 2001 
 Hey Buddy!  Small note - on row 45 you show fuel of 19% instead of 1.90% 
 No back surgery yet.  Second opinion Dr. said "let's just wait for 3 months and see what happens.  We can always do the surgery." I liked that idea.  Give Mom and Dad a big hug for me. 
 I see you ran the March demand charges through TP2 over the weekend.  What about April or are you waiting for us to clean it up? 
 Can you tell me if we have anything scheduled on this deal number for this contract please? 
 If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.  If you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charge on TCO at all.  Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the SST Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).   Backs doing ok.  Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.  And yes it has been a stressfull bid week.  But you r probably making tons of dough. 
 My numbers match.  You de MAN 
 I just sent in a request for a new CGAS/NFUL interconnect - request #2410.  I entered meter number 6000065 for NFUL, it should be 600065.  Opps. 
 Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following deal tickets  Deal  Comment 470563  New Power Exchange buy 470568  New Power Exchange sell 470582  CPR Storage Sell 470587  CPR Storage Buy  We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st. Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in Sitara.  Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions. 
 According to Nelson this deal should be on GULF3, not GULF1.  Woul you plea= se=20 change it?  Thanks 
 My contacts at The New Power company said you should call this number 1-888-926-9988. 
 I should be getting my uzzi out of the shop on Friday too! 
 He didn't invite me.  He don't know what's good for him does he?  AND he lives in a bad neighborhood. 
 Lunch was terrible today.  I don't know who it was though. 
 Phil, please call Jim Homco to discuss Oglethorpes needs.  His extension is 3-7898. 
 Robin Barbe did a long term sale to EES.  The volume is 1200 dt/day.  EES has the option of taking delivery at Tenn Zone 5, meter #20816 or on CNG (Dominion), meter DOMSP.  The contract price to EES is the same at both locations.  Deal 624140 is the sale on Tenn.  EES requested the volumes on CNG effective 3/23/2001.  I created deal 686905 for the sale on EES.  Kimat, I assume the CNG will need to hedged. 
 Let me know if you guys are receiving the Transco postings. 
 Buddy! 
 We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.  Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day. 
 On call for the weekend. 
 I approved the following deals  677408 and 677411.   Please do your economic voodoo. 
 im not tellin 
 Dudes like Chics with horns! 
 Better polish those horns :o) 
 Kimat, I added TRCO meter 4091 to deal 30512.  Please do whatever crazy things you Economics people do.  All you other folks, we will be delivering a total of 3503 for the month of March to this meter.  We don't even need to chat with NYPA about this either. 
 ANYTIME.  I 'm here to serve you.  Remeber me during review time. 
 YES I DID! 
 This is copied out of Transco's system and its allll i got.   4091 MAMOU LEIDY II                 LA EVANGELINE      3      512.840 ENRON SUPPLY FOR NYPA FTNT                               6539 
 Because I know you care - I feel terrible today - mostly my head.  How can that be if there is nothing there???  I don't know if its alergies or what. 
 Would you check on the status of meter request 02325 and let me know where it stands?  We need to deliver gas to this point. 
 What curves are assigned to the following Transco meters  Meter 6540 & 6923  Thanks 
 FUNNNNNY!~!!!   No thanks on the recliner.  I think I want to get rid of my living furniture first and I may wait until I move to a bigger apartment.  My last electric bill was $22.00 - that's hard to beat.  I'm so pooooooor now. Let's see 1700 options witht the stock dropping $20 per share means no big down payment on a house. 
 Thanks.  He's one of the few people i do remember.  I always like him and man could he weld. 
 MICHAEL GARRED @ NEWPOWER 03/13/2001 04:53 PM 
 I thought class was on Saturday and as for the child - use duct tape.  It has great sticking power!! 
 Uhhhhh - Stacey with NYPA is coming in on Tuesday and wants to come over and visit with all of us.  Would you like to do an early dinner with Stacey, myself and 2 or 3 other Enron folks???  OR you and Rose could take her out Tuesday nite and I could go do something else entirely!!!!!!!!! 
 This is what I have. 
 I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.  please let me know when you validate these or what else you need.  Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.  Did this have a big p&l impact?  My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF. 
 I be gittin a couple of BIG HUGS!! 
 Stacey with NYPA will be at the Hyatt (next door) on next Tuesday and it sounds like she has no plans Tuesday evening (hint hint).  Let me know if you are interested in doing anything.  She will probably be coming over to the Enron building that afternoon. 
 Jerry is working on his house and I think its raining in East Texas so I probably won't go to either. 
 You know Judy will never go and who knows if i will.  I think its a Sambuca party on March 21st. 
 Uhhhh   Pappasitos today and we shoudl chat after I eat my food.  That means that YOU DE MAN!!!!! 
 Kim, please invite the Following Texas Eastern folks to the party.  Leah Moss Janice Devers Berk Donaldson  The address is  5400 Westheimer Court Houston, TX  77056-5310 
 We have 9189/day of supply at Niagara on NFUL and transport through Oct 2001.  For April 2001, we sold the Niagara Supply to the Firm Ontario book at $.33.  Kimat, I told them to use IM ME CNG as the desk selling the gas. 
 You are going to hate me.  I lost all my little notes on the 40,000 backhaul and the 40,000 backhaul IT contract.  Would you email that to me please? 
 I'm very tired.  WHAT A GAME!! 
 Thanks for the invite.  I won't be able to golf for awhile. 
 I added the pipelines and zone/point combonations that I feel we will be using most on EOL.   Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Hey, I'm getting a mental image here ( of you pawing the ground that is)!!  Backs doing ok right now.  I'm getting a second opinion next Monday.  If the second opinion comes in with the same verdict, then I will probably have the surgery in April or May.  Jerry said a friend of his told him it took a whole month to recover.  I'm thinking a week max then I can go back to work, we shall see.  I can't make money if I'm not at work, and my p&l is a big part of my evaluation next year.  AND I'm afraid to buy a new truck with the stock market situation.  Who knows - I may be out of work sometime soon. 
 Why are you going to Florida? 
 You are welcome.  I'm glad you enjoyed them. 
 NOOOO!  Tell me it isn't so!!! 
 I updated the transport demand charges on Tetco and Trco for March.  Please get those in the P&L sometime this week.  Also note:  I think I had Trco at TP1 instead of TP2.  thanks 
 Judy also bought 10,000 dt of long haul from you.  Whats the term and the demand on that?   thanks 
 My appointment is next Monday at 2:00Pm 
 Maybe you should just send an email request and see what you get for the Transco party. 
 Kim, I would like to invite Joni to our Gas Fair party.  Please send her the info via email?  Thanks 
 I'll give you an inviye to our party.  I don't know when or where or if I'm gonna go but I'll give you an invite anyway. 
 I don't think I ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get this via capacity release.  I'm here for you - NOT.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Beverly just announced her resignation too. 
 Transco party on the 21st.  I'm going, how about you? 
 I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was coming back from Jerry's yesterday.  I kept getting a message like "We're sorry, this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers"  or something like that.  I had that same problem with Mr. Homco's home phone number a couple of weeks ago. 
 I created deal 665150, TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 30 priced at GD.  We did this on the 7th because we didn't sell the St 30. 
 On the 8th, we went short on TP2 at St 65.  I created deal 665147 as a TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 65.  I entered the price as Z3 GD.  Please let me know if you want to adjust it.  thanks 
 TP2 is buying Spinnaker gas (deal 632998) from Gulf 1 at Zone 2 IF (deal 657407).  TP2 is selling the gas back to Gulf1 at IF plus variable cost (deal 657409) at St 45.  It is my understanding that the transport commodity rate for gas from this well is $.02 plus fuel.  SO, I just changed the price on deal 657409 from Z2 IF + .09 to Z2 IF + .045.  We should see about $68,000.00 move from TP2 to Gulf 1. 
 I would like to RSVP for the Houston Energy Expo Customer Celebration in The Crystal Ballroom in the Rice Hotel on Wed, March 21, 2001.  Please call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions.  thanks 
 Didn't know I could do this.  I need the summer and winter fuel retention for zone 1 to zone sl. 
 Thanks buddy.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I think both of you should go. 
 I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  I entered the following deals at a zero commodity 470563  Buy exchange 470582  Sell Cpr Storage  470587 Buy CPR Storage 470568 Sell exchange   I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through March 31.  I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes. 
 Good to go.  thanks  ONly one more month to go. 
 Thats it for now.  Thanks.  I will probably have questions next week. 
 I'm thinking about a Nissan Pathfinder.  Then I think about just keeping my money and driving what I have. 
 How am I suppossed to determine a good back doctor from a bad back doctor?? 
 Numbers still look good after inputting the 27th and the 28th. 
 This is good to go.  How about a new New Power download - I've been tweaking here and there. 
 Good to hear from you.  Man I guess I'm just falling apart, physically and mentally.  Can't invest worth a crap either.  I'm going to start burying my money in a tin can somewhere.  I also keep thinking about buying a place and/or a new car.  But then I look at my $20.00 utility bill - thats a hard thing to ingnore.  Someones waiting for me here.  Chat with you later. 
 I changed the price on deal 636796 back to TRCO Z6 Non Ny. 
 What mid price does this deal come to TP2 at?   Deal 655067 
 What do you think? 
 I think you have my NYMX value in backwards. 
 For the year  My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This morining it should have been $123035.00.  I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818. 
 You de MAN 
 I just made a couple of changes.  Would you send it to me again please? 
 Thanks.  I have a big head now!!!  Why do I still feel like a grunt??? 
 I need to get our most recent bills for Sea Robin.  I show a contract #FSRP3, MDQ = 25,000, and a demand of $56,498 
 I'm giving you a smidgeon of my profits. 
 Would you send me an Oglethorpe invoice for Feb please?

 This is what I have for Feb.  I still need to update the 27th and 28th volumes.  Let me know if you have questions. 
 Could you get me the Gas Daily's for Columbia Gas Appalachian for Feb 2001?  It shows up as Columbia, App in Gas Daily. 
 I'm still working on Feb.  This is March.  First 6 days look good.

 Let's chat about CNG retail storage on Monday 
 In my Enron Online phone book Greg Whalley is now listed as the President & CEO of Enron Net Works LLC and his phone number is 713-853-5220.  And I was told that Louise Kitchen is now COO of Enron North America and her phone number is 713-853-3488 
 NYPA was short on their cotract for the Month of Feb.  Transco will allocate about 3,500 dts as a delivery to NYPA on the contract and activity listed below effective 2/28/01.  This will be an OA thingy anyway so I will get with everyone next Tuesday (day after Black Monday) to get this in Unify. 
 Please use contract .2774,  acitivity 852981, for the NYPA volumes we discussed.  Also, let me know what the exact volume is after you do the allocation. 
 I created the following deals  Deal   Comment 597271  AO6 597290  B9 597293  C16 649650  Bookout with 535158, 376880, 168997, and 551007 
 Andy Ring has an Oglethorpe contract at her desk.  But I've never looked at it. 
 I just fixed contract B00693026471 again.  This contract ended 10/31/2000. 
 I moved deal 601925 (sale to South Jersey at Broad Run) from CGAS to Tenn. 
 Take a look at deal 168996.  I took the expected volumes to 0.  This goes with deal 643761. 
 Effective March 1st, I moved the volumes on deal 377268 (Non NY sale to New Power) to deal 643754 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS).  Please correct the hedge information.  I also created deal 643761 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS).  I believe this deal is in the index book but does not show up in Sitara.  I believe it was originally a Z6 Non Ny sale to New Power also.  Let me know if you have any questions.  thanks 
 Have I told you how wonderful you are?  I actually the Gas Daily prices for every day.  If you could just enter them in Column S I would be so gratefull. 
 I would like to be able to run "Facilitation By Location" with the following criteria 1.  I want to pick the counterparty or leave it blank. 2.  I want to enter a date range ==> 02/01/2001 to 02/11/2001 3.  I want to be able to select one or more pipelines without choosing a desk. 
 Could I get a copy of Trco cashout and the detail for Jan please.  Judy and I are going to use it to decide what to do tomorrow. 
 Transco Z6 cashout buy is 5.5393, and I think it traded around $5.52.  We will use the $5.5393 and I'll send you and email. 
 FYI 
 My Canadian folks gave me the wrong number for March.  The correct number is .62 instead of .50.  Which makes the spread  .42      .49 
 I changed the pipeline and the meter on deal 628466 from NFUL #7126 to TRCO #7126. 
 Dec 2001  Dec 2001 Nymx  5.45 5.45 CNG South/North .45 .52 ----------   ---------- Total   5.90 5.97  Mar 2001 Nymx  4.86 4.86 Niagara   .50 .50 -----------    ----------- Total   5.36 5.36   Spread   .54 .61  80%   .432       .488 20%   .108      .122 
 I keep getting "insufficient memory" messages on my computer.  And that's without running Dynegy Direct.  The IT guy said I need one of the following 1.  New super duper computer 2.  More memory, my computer has 128meg of ram 3.  Run my applications on 2 cmputers like mine instead of one. 
 I fixed the volumes on deals 456638 and 456630 for the 31st.  Please take all other volumes on these deals to 0.  Thanks 
 I will be out the afternoon of Friday, March 2 for my MRI.  And I have a Dr. appointment the morning of Wed, March 7. 
 I just checked and I don't have any daily information.  I know they sent it to me, I must have tossed it by mistake. 
 Can you get the deal ticket for me on this deal please? 
 Please recall the following contracts effective 2/24/2001   VNG  k# Offer #  ENA k# 100007  15002  523666 100104  15003  523664 200088  15004  523667 700005  15008  571492  I think this is all. 
 I ended deal 340210 effective 2/28/01 and created deal 630810 effective 3/1/2001.  But, I see both deals active un Unify on contract 2891 on 3/1/2001.  I don't know what impact this will have, if any. 
 We should have included the ACA, GRI, and Great Plains in our sales price to Midcoast.  You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation.  Just a note, we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market, resulting in a much higher transport cost, OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead, giving us a $0 transport cost.  Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ($.0792 in this case) regardless of what we do with the gas.  By the way, Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001.  The IT feeder for Zone 3 goes from $.0792 to $.0769 effective 2/1/2001, fuel remains unchanged at .45%. 
 I would like to see the Gas Daily's for the following, no rush.  Transco Z6 NY Transco Z6 Non NY Transco St 65 Henry Hub Tetco M3 Tetco Ela 
 I'll be gone but I will leave it on top of my desk.  The backpack is dark blue and is has "CRUX by Gregory" written on it.  There is a yellow cooler inside and 2 flashlights. 
 I wuzn't invited to the wedding.  AND when you sit down and think about the hedges and transport stuff, you will be surprised at how much stuff you remember.  The quickest way to learn transport???  Get copies of the invoices.  And guess what, I got another compliment on my sweat pants  on Saturday!!! 
 Hey buddy, would you check these numbers?  This is what's on our Transco reports for the deliveries to Doyle.  Date Burn's 1 2 6050 3 206 4 4765 5 6 
 We have set up this VNG contract in Sitara twice, as   6507  (see deal 512077) and  .6507  Currently all Transco contracts have the decimal preceding the number. Please terminate 6507 effective 12/31/2000.  Thanks 
 The East Desk is having a meeting tomorrow at the same time to discuss the split out of the East Desk into 11 new books.  I need to attend the East Desk meeting first.  Please take my name off the list for the Thursday meeting.  Thanks 
 Now thats a ture "Pig Farmer" poem if I ever heard one.  I would have sent flowers to my beloved in Ohio if someone would have given me her address. 
 Per navigator, this is the only New Power pool activity for the 1st. 
 This is everything scheduled on CGAS except the pool for the 1st.  I'm working on that now. 
 Would you send me the Gas Daily's for Henry Hub, Transco St 65, Transco St 45, Tetco Wla, Tetco Stx, and Tetco Ela for the last year please.  Thanks 
 Mr. Homco gave this his stamp of approval.  It's ready to go.  thanks 
 I brought in my backback, 2 flashlights, and a small cooler type thing.  They are sitting on top of my neighbor's desk.  Come take a look when you get a chance. 
 I made some changes to New Power.  Would you please send me a new purchase and sales worksheet for Jan?  thanks 
 This is what's in Unify.  The only odd item is how I entered the cashout, as a negative demand charge.  I used 1618 dts x $7.611 (It buy in Zone 6).  Let me know what you think.  Maybe we should add the IT transport to the cashout from Z6 to Z4.  I would certainly want to do that if they were short. 
 I'm looking for the following demand charges  $93835.00 (12.314.60)  Do you see those anywhere?  They are on deal 554846. 
 Please send me a download of the Oglethorpe info for January.  We might be able to do the billing from Unify this month.  If not, I should be able to make the dollars match.  thanks 
 Sounds good. 
 Doesn't look too good right now.  I forgot about the HPL people.  I think we already have too many people and management may be waiting to see how many HPL people are staying with Enron on the trading side.  I'll keep you posted.  If you are bud's with Scott Hendrickson, he would be a good one to talk to. I don't want to mention your name unless I hear of something. 
 Can you verify what New Power is getting at A06 please? 
 -      From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001) Worker dead at desk for 5 days  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  "A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick occasionally.

 Take a look at the daily volumes when you get a chance.  I show you taking an extra 500 dts or so everyday. 
 My leg hurts still.  This is what I'm taking  Lodine XL Tab 600MG - take 1 tab in the morning after my breakfeast snack Cyclobenzaprine Tab 10MG - take 1 tab before going to bed 
 Same thing for Trco k#.7537, deals 232576 and 271489 
 I changed the end date to 12/31/2000 on Trco k#2.2390, deals 77157 and 320086.  I had it set up as evergreen. 
 I don't see a year to date p&l for Judy.  My worksheet shows NYMX position to be flat and her yeart to date P&L is about ($146,000.00).  Would you just verify that for me please.  Thanks 
 Thanks for the info, I see a couple of changes I need to make.  We may send this out a couple of days late. 
 Jan 2001 is at the bottom of the worksheet.  Ain't this cool? 
 Would you send me a copy of the new desk mapping please?  thanks cg 
 FYI 
 FYI  Read and file. 
 Still hurts but just when I move it.  Woke up at 4:15 am this morning. Worked out.  Now I'm really sleepy.  Got a dr appointment this afternoon. 
 We've never done this, I'm just thinking they may work with us on it since no one knew the rates were going to be effective 2/1/2001. 
 I'g going to have Judy work Tansco over for a backhaul discount for the summer. 
 Beverly, what do you think? 
 Could you give me the January 2001 Gas Daily's for the following points  Texas Eastern Stx  Wla Ela  Etx  Transco Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3  Thanks 
 Transco confirmed that effective 2/1/2001, the forward haul and back haul commodity rates will be the same on both IT and FT. 
 Scott Goodell said the Sonat items look correct.  The other items are for the Central Desk and I don't know who looks at it.  It's probably ok since the Central Desk items are more straight forward. 
 Nope.  How's that for an anwser.  Noone responded and I would be more than happy to have a big ol meeting on it too. 
 Hey - I just started taking a Spanish class last week.  My class name is Miguel and I'm a cocinero! 
 http://www.tax.co.harris.tx.us/ 
 I would like to get access to Mimic.  Brad McKay has an ID and Sean uses it to do Gas Daily queries. 
 I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me. If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities are the same now.  In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was $.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.  I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until October, after the summer period?

 You get our undying love and gratification!  I'll buy the next time we go to Chic Fil A! 
 I was going to Mexico with the dough but decided against it.  We received $11,240.63 from medical reimbursements and $5.00 from the Electric Company.  I just transferred $3,749.00 to to your checking accounts. 
 Bookout purchase deal 551027 with sales deals 380492, 376880, and 551007.  I created a sale to New Power (deal 597332) for gas they take out of our pool into their pool.

 The gloves are off and the courtship begins - what's your work address? Valentine goodies are on the way.  I'm officially in love... with you! 
 Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS.  Dick and I will be chatting about this later today.  Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard about it. 
 She doesn't know that I exist,  now that I'm single again and all.  I should be able to lose 30 or 40 pounds by then. 
 yeah, I'm really busy.  I gotta wash my hair.  Where you guys going just in case I someone ask me? 
 Where?  Just curious. 
 --  Subject: Cute story   Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.  When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my  aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the  ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.'  ? They stopped that crap after  I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.

 I just moved the following 2 sales to New Power from Trco Non NY to CGAS - WGL, deals 377264 (volume = 515 day) and deal 377268 (volume = 5 day).  Joann, New Power will probably take some of this gas to BG&E.

 Hey Woman!  This is the email I sent to my folks last week regarding Egan. 
 You are welcome and have a nice day! 
 Hey Matt.  Sorry about not getting back to you sooner.  I probably won't move for another 9 months.  I have some legal issues I'm heavily involved in that will be taking up a lot of my time.  Thanks. 
 I changed the Egan volumes for the 30th and 31st from 2599 to 4793 on the 30th and 4794 on the 31st.  This empties out our storage. 
 Scott Goodell is the expert on this pipeline and I just can't say enough good things about him. 
 Just spoke with Jerry.  Jerry, Barbara, the bird and the squirrel are on their way to East Texas. 
 I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you can use.  I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though. 
 Please change deal 583629 (sale to Mirant on NFUL) to Market East.  It won't let me change it.  Thanks 
 How do you make those ham and tortillia thingys?  I want to make some for the super bowl party this Sunday. 
 According to my numbers, I show we have taken 67,560 out of storage through today.  And we are taking out 12,995 (2599 x 5 days) from the 27th - 31st. Could you double check my numbers please?   Thanks 
 I'm sorry.  I'm still looking for it but I think I deleted all the photo's. I'm checking my CD's.  Just pretend you are getting a big hug from me and that I'm taking you to your favorite resteraunt - Chic Fil A. 
 Lines 6, 7, & 8 are sales to CES at the citygate, deals 250126 and 250131. The schedulers wanted 2 deal tickets for tracking purposes.  The pricing should be the same.  I did make a teeny little error, line 7 should be prices at $3.4228 and line 8 should be priced at $3.4428. 
 I will send these as I find them.  This is the detail I sent to Jeff for the April 2000 manual invoice.  It looks like the only deals that should have been suspended are the citygate CGAS sales.  Line 7 under the "Manual Invoice" tab applies to deal 268094, volume of 615600 at $3.1279, sale to CES for Proxy storage injections. Line 6 applies to deals 227081 and 227113, sales to CES at the citygate. Line 8 shows the incremental transport expense ENA incurred to allow CES to swing.  Today I would take this expense and add it to the sales price on deals 227081 and 227113. Line 9????  I still can't figure out what I did here.  I think everything else is sorta clear. 
 I'm emailing all of you because I never know how the deals will show up in Sitara.

 How does the VNG GSS work?   AND, Jerry and Barbara are coming to Houston tonight.  They want to go to P F Changs.  Jerry said they would leave around 6:00 Pm putting them here around 6:45 to 7:00PM.  Of course you are invited and I told him I would let him know where to meet us when they hit the road.  Questions? 
 Thanks.  You are wonderfulllll! 
 Yes - a small one.  So maybe you should go camping with me - and I have fishing stuff too.  Where  are you going camping. 
 Please educate me - what are the current cashout rules? 
 I'm here for you.  Just remember me favorably when you become my boss someday.  I fetch coffe and pop, I always keep a stash of crackers,... the list goes on. 
 Is this what you are looking for? 
 Let me know if you have questions.  I think we need to add Nov 2000.  AND, according to Navigator, the balance in storage on 1/20/2001 is 2,973,373.  Assuming ENA is owes you 40,000, the balance is 3,013,373 which is about 49% of the total storage balance.  Is this a comfortable number or crititcal?  Joann, are there any special storage rules for Feb and March?  Are we required to have at least 40% in storage on 1/31/2001? 
 Its ok to do the netout.  The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they enter the pipeline statements in Unify. 
 It's Leah Moss at the pipeline.  It's Judy Townsend here.  Leah's number is 713-627-5054. 
 I just checked the 24th, the actual number per navigator (actuals delivered to New Power from Stow) is 54246.  I'll check the others on Monday now that I know how to do it. 
 Just looking high level, I see 3 days where storage is off by more than 1,000 dt's that I will check into.  Date Sitara  Jeff's 24th 54245  55720 26th 25058  32794 28th 39388  40053  I don't understand your storage number on the 16th.  Does that mean you banked gas that day?  Also, I setup a column for Navigator numbers and it looks like we took out 66,000 for ENA.  I need to reconcile storage back to Nov so I can track what we took out vs. what we pay New Power for. 
 I sure wish you would send me the excel worksheet for this.  I'm such a lazy butt. 
 Call me, we want the backhaul contract 
 I need to look and see what I have.  But first, you are not going with some boys are you???  I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could put some goodies in to keep them dry.  Do you need fishing stuff? 
 These rates are correct and I'm assuming you want wellhead to the pool (no surcharges).  Zone 4 to 4 is the most expensive zone on the pipe, Zone 5 runs a close second.  Are you sure you want 4 instead of 4a (mobile bay)? 
 Should we just take the capaity for Feb and March or do you want to release the whole term then recall it later? 
 Dick is changing his sell to NP price to $7.22   MICHAEL GARRED @ NEWPOWER 01/18/2001 11:43 AM 
 IGS recalled 4000 dt's of TGT capacity effective 1/18/2001- 1/31/2001on contract T016937.  Our new MDQ is 14,225 for Jan. 
 Thursday PM would be ok.  Would you set it up please? 
 Could we meet to go over this?  AND are there any other folks we should invite? 
 I'll call you this afternoon after Joann and I talk about the storage volumes for Dec. 
 Tim Ray is "The Man" at New Power to talk to about the any asset management deals.  I would love to be involved.  Mr. David Scott can get you Tim's number. 
 Please take the volumes to 0 for these 2 Hopewell deals on Dec 31.  Deal 549152 & 549163.  Robin, I took the price to 0 on both of these deals. 
 I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle this for him.  Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES? 
 Could you send me the excel worksheet so I won't have to recreate it?  Man you are a true Buddy!! 
 In the fridge next to the mustard. 
 Jeff, don't forget that Mike is taking 27835 of the FOM gas into his pool everyday.  With the Maumee cuts, I am showing that you are buying gas daily from ENA everyday.   Column T under the CGAS tab shows what Gas Daily volumes you are taking from me.  Column V shows the Gas Daily sells you are making to me.  Column F is the citygate storage number that should match cell Q41 on your COH sheet.  We have one big discrepancy on the 8th.  Call me if you have questions.   Joann, on the 8th, Jeff is showing a withdrawal of 57431(citygate number) we are showing a volume of 49560 (48478 at the citygate).  Would you check that please. 
 I changed all the volumes to 0 on this deal now that I have a good picture of what took place.  Please make sure you have 0 pathed on these deals for the 1st through the 4th.  thanks 
 Exactly what an old married guy would think too! 
 Where is my new Oglethorpe sheet? 
 I don't know if this was ever resolved but Susan Pereira's name is on the deal ticket. 
 Would you guys see what is flowing current day at these points please? 
 I've made some changes to the sales.  Would you please send me another excel worksheet for December?  thanks 
 You are so wonderful.  I am truly privlidged to work with you.  OK.  I would like for you to send Mr. Porter the remaining storage balance every other day and copy me - something like this.  Date  1/7/2001 Balance 3,495,871  And I would do it on a 2 day lag like this, today is the 9th, give him the balance for the 7th.  Or maybe you are doing this already? 
 Just send cookies then and we will be happy. 
 Please bookout deal 563831 with deal 563837. 
 Please let me know what ENA is taking from New Power's pool and what New Power is taking from ENA's pool for the following dates  Date Jan 1 Jan 2 Jan 3     Thanks. 
 Buddy, we need to chat. 
 Darla, this invoice is incorrect.  Please send out the manual invoice I sent you. 
 Do you know the details of the Dynegy contract? 
 These are the meter numbers I changed on deal 549411 effective 1/8/2001.  The total changed on the deal was a decrease of 31205. 
 I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.  I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!  Joann,  for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893 from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes the AO6 they are buying from us).  Which means we should only have 3844 out of the pool.   Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows  Vol Comment 3844 Out of the pool 25893 Other receipt supply xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket. 
 The 2 Transco delivery points for the CP&L RFP (#6608 and #6562) are upstream of the Zone 5 pool.  So we should be able to segment  the longhaul VNG space.  Meter    Mainline Mile Marker / Lateral Mile Marker 6608  PSCN Gaston   1323.51 / 0 6562  NC Nat Gas   1375.51 / 0   9167  Zone 5 Sta 165 ENA FT Pool 1412.99 / 0  941   Emporia    1412.99 / 102.89 
 My buddy is looking at lots on Seargent Beach.  Drive from your place to Seargent, go over the intercoastal, and take a left.  He said lots in there go for about $17,000.00.  He wants to buy one canal lot and one or two beach lots.  Comments? 
 I moved the volumes on deal 241639 from Transco Leidy to CNG Leidy. 
 Anyone here today??  Deliverd prices are about $12.75 right now, using Non NY pricing. 
 For Tues through the end of the month, please show Tenn Z5 and Z6 flat, and have the Wright gas into Canajoharie.  Tenn, I will be looking at what we have available on the Net 284 contract on your sheet to determine our flexibility. 
 See below to see what "The Man" has to say. 
 In the old days, you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points. That was when these contracts were good for the whole year.  So you are telling me the "rules have changed"?  I can now flow 100% from secondary points? 
 Raquel, Robert Tilotta has the original tax bill and he is in your office. His number is 713-853-7995.  Please call him at your convience.  Robert, can the tax agency provide us with support (contract numbers, inventory balances...)?  Thanks 
 Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and not actual flow volumes.  AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different? 
 We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt point on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced from Secondary receipt points? 
 Good point.  Is that also Bear Creek storage?  The tax bill specifically states Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I also left a voicemail for our tax guy. There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authority comes up with their number.  I would like to see it but I bet it takes a while to get the support.  I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage.  We have some type of deal with NOPSI.  Any other ideas on that? 
 Question:  We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch storage for the 2000 tax year.  I found out yesterday that ENA handles no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that.  Do you know what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year?  We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I assume this would all be for CES/New Power.  If you know of any other Sonat storages we had for the 2000 tax year, please let me know.  Brenda will fax the Koch storage tax bill to you.  Thanks Chris. 
 You De Man! 
 I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.  The amount is $5,606.78 and it is for the the 2000 tax year.  I was notified about this yesterday and I think it was due on 12/31/2000.  How do you want to handle this?  I was going to pay it and bill New Power for the whole amount.  I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.  Robert, please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499.  Thanks 
 This is ready to go.  I highlighted areas that you need to fill in.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the Oglethorpe.  I just sent my info to Mr. Homco for review.  Would you please send me the December purchases and sales for New Power?  thanks 
 Would you please be so kind and take a peek at this. 
 Attached are my demand charges and CGAS activity for December.  Jeff, I have all the prices in my worksheet.  It would be easy to calculate one citygate price to put on our big citygate deal ticket.  And we are still out of balance starting on the 22nd. 
 Dear Team,  I updated the bookout deals 523459 and 523444 for the following dates, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 29th, 30th, and 31st.  Please path this in Unify and let me know when its done.  Thanks. 
 Revised the volume to 571 on the 4th and 615 on the 5th. 
 I sold gas to New Power for today and tomorrow, deal 557800.  New Power will take this gas into their pool.  Date  Volume  Price 1/4/2001 963  10.31 1/5/2001 1007  10.31 
 I have 9000 day.  Ellwood will be a secondary delivery point on my contract so any deal would be best efforts.  I have a call in to National Fuel to find out how they do their constraints. 
 Opps.  I took it home to read and I think I used it to start a fire and reduce my energy cost.  Would you please fax it to me at 713-646-8453?  You are so wonderfull. 
 I just entered the CES demand charges for August on the following deals  Deal 343896 - East demand charges of $655,443  Deal 231667 - Market East demand charges of $881,995  Thank you Melba 
 You guys may see an opportunity for this gas sometime.  I have gas on National Fuel that I could deliver into CGAS at Ellwood City on a secondary basis.  Ellwood in Op 8, Market area 35, I think.  This trades around a CNG North plus.  Let me know one way or another, I'm just eager to learn. 
 I added meter DOMSP to deal 549660, please adjust the hedge.  thanks 
 Please send me the Oglethorpe activity in excel for Dec 2000.  thanks 
 I need 2 x-large shirts for Oglethorpe Power please.  I am going to give them to Mr. Homco to pass on to Oglethorpe. 
 I changed the demand charge from $.155 to $.20 in Sitara., 
 I also increase the price from $10.53 to $10.8003, that should have a bit of an impact. 
 We made 1 big change that will impact tonights P&L.  We chanbed the volume on deal 549411 from 72,000 per day to 106,000 per day.  This is and CGAS index sale. 
 I have not updated the last 4 days of the month yet. 
 Are you and Muffy snuggleing?  I was in East Texas over the New Year's and I saw snow - just enough to make the ground white with a little grass sticking up thru the snow. 
 Dick bought gas from Tim Ray, does this impact our stuff?  Dick bought 15000 day at 9.21 from the 4th-31st. 
 I created deal 461123 (purchase from New Power) and deal 461134 (sale to New Power).  I will price both deals using the FOM index pricing.

 We have some volume discrepancies starting on the 23rd.  The 3rd column from the right is my calculation of the Overtakes.  The second column from the right is your cal of over's and under's.  Our storage numbers are close enough for me. 
 I believe I entered all the purchases New Power made for January 2001.

I sent a request for a new meter to Global facilities.  Whew, I think thats it.  Deal 551058 will need to fixed next week.  I'll do if I remember. 
 Bookout purchase deal 551053 with sales deal 547583

 Cancelled my trip, I'm here all day, too great a chance for NY to get a blizzard. 
 When do you take the bike to the shop?  I have your key on my keyring. 
 This deal needs to be moved to ENA - Im Marketeast. 
 This is all I've seen for the 1st. 
 I tried to fax all 4 deal sheets at once - and the pages stuck together.  So I faxed each page seperately.  Nice outfit.  Judy says "Hey". 
 I am showing a balance of 80,265 in the Egan park deal as of Jan 1, 2001. Egan is showing a balance of 84,944.  I am using our balance for now.  I'm taking 2592 dt's in to Texas Gas for the 1st and 2nd, and 2599 dt's per day for the balance of the month.  I tried to update all the deal tickets but I won't know if it worked until after our systems work. 
 I created a buy/sell with Hopewell that we are going to kill after the month is over.  Deals 549136 and 549152 will be killed next week.  These tickets are just estimating the loss on oil replacement. 
 Jim had a death in the family and is gone.  I didn't change any of the info at the top but the invoice number should be 18719SA I think. 
 I changed the effective date of deal 547638 from Jan-2000 to Jan-2001. 
 Any news? 
 I created deal 547910, with a price of IF + .0125. 
 Mr. Scott found and one of my errors.  Deal 377264 is for only 470dt's per day. 
 What are women really looking for in life? 
 For January, I moved 2 deals from Trco Non NY to CGAS/WGL meter 78-30.  Both deals are sales to New Power.  Deal Volume 377268 5 (yes thats right 5 dt's) 377264 475  Kimat, you need to do some of that voodoo economic stuff because this deal has hedges.  Joann & Alvin, this will not be part of the Citygate deal for Choice, this is a citygate sale to New Power at WGL.  Dave, where are my New Power golf shirts, one for me, one for my sidekick Scott. 
 I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara.  However, I do use meter numbers and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902.  Deal 241639 is (term purchase from AEC) is at this meter.  And deal 511043 (ENA-Im Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario) is also at this meter for December.  It doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set up in Sitara.  Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes, *  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file? *  Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple)? *   Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time? *  Can this change take effect 1/1/2001? *  If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today, I'll buy him a "pop". . 
 I created deal 546310 for pool sales to New Power.  I currently have a daily volume fo 4250 on this deal.  We should be able to move the volumes back and forth between this deal and the big citygate deal.  Jeff, I will look at the volumes on our big citygate deal ticket and this one pool deal to calculate the Gas Daily pricing. 
 I will need to see the CGAS invoices for Dec when we get them.  According to New Power, we should have overrun charges. 
 That makes sense.  So you really are not using any ENA space but then I need to check the overrun charges on the invoice.  If its ok with you, I think I'll just wait to review the invoice before I do anything with that. 
 What was the volume of Jeffy gas going to Mikey?  And what day did that start? 
 According to my records, New Power has 140,099 dt's of CGAS capacity.  On the 22nd, we scheduled 143,400 dt's on deal 502957.  Please verify that New Power took 143,400 dt's on the 22nd, its ok, I just need to do a price adjustment.  Thanks 
 Since we are selling deliverd gas, the Receipt and Delivery volumes should be the same.  Also, we can fix it so the imbalance is 0 on the 22nd if that would be easier.  Let me know buddy. 
 Would you look at this and let me know if it looks ok.  I'm going to send this to Willie after I get your approval.  My economic folks just gave me the Gas Daily prices.

 HEY!!  I'm a sweet guy, modest too.  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!    Enron North America Corp. 
 This is where we are today on the VNG releases to ENA.  All effective dates are 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2003 unless stated differently.

According to CGAS, we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract.  Scott is waiting to hear from CGAS.  At this point, we will not release the capacity effective for the 1st.  Tenn -  I do not have the new contract numbers yet.  Per Tenn - Scott will send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to the new ENA contracts.  Trco - Trco has a capacity release "glitch" in their EBB and needs to "temporarily flip a switch" while I do the capacity releases.  Since I know Trco well, I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in case their are EDI issues with the "switch flipping".  AND we would not know about any problems until the 31st.  Also, VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity.  Williams has 15,930 dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service.  I will release 20,000 dth to ENA.  This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams. 
 Attached is my pricing and the capacity for December.   I went thru the capacity fairly close on CGAS so this should be correct.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Also, for the 1st,  I'm showing a FOM volume of 31,679 dth per day.  This is a combination of your max FOM Exhibit 1 gas, plus the CGLF volume plus some NX1 CGAS volumes. 
 Guess Who???  Its back on my desk.  How do you feel about doing a manual invoice?  That will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point. 
 I changed the term on deal 510007.  Steve, this is CNG contract #100104 for 15225 dth day.  The primary receipt point on this capaity is storage.  Is this a Nov-Mar deal or is this capacity good all year?    Brenda, what are the rules for setting up VNG demand charges?  Also, we are releasing most (not all) of the VNG space to ENA effective 1/1/2001.  Should I set up ENA - Im VNG as the primary desk for demand charges? 
 We need to chat about the following VNG deals. 420130,  543185,  and 543186 
 What volumes do we have for Power Gas Marketing and for the sale to Clinton? AND what has Clinton agreed to pay us?  What is the deal number for the sale to Clinton? 
 I changed the term on this deal ticket. 
 This is the first notice from Transco regarding imbalances.  Transco has not changed their IT notices since the 6th, when they closed down St 90. 
 Sounds good to me.  I bet this is next to the Warick?? Hotel. 
 Wonderful.  One more question, could you give me the meter numbers for these points? 
 Cindy, take all the M2 production gas into our M2 tabs and lets go long in the pool.  We will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see what Dominion is producing.  We will not have this gas for January. 
 I don't think we are doing anything.  Dick had an idea but I didn't know what he was looking at. 
 I just sold David Scott 170 dth of TCO pool at $11.06 for the 22nd (deal 542442).  New Power will schedule this gas out of our pool.  Bottom line , this is Mikey gas which is different from Jeffy gas. 
 If you read this before I call you then I will make brownies and bring them in. 
 Marlene, please call Beverly at 713-853-6357 when you get this contract set up.  Thanks 
 I killed deal 454471. 
 Kimat, this is the offset to the big gain we made on CGAS last night on that one deal.  I increased our sales volume on deal. 502957 by 10,000dth/day starting on the 19th.  Deal 502957 is a citygate, index based sale and we should show a big loss on it tonite.

 I will.  I hope you got my Christmas list. 
 Does GRI go from $.0072 to $.0070 in January?  And I love that outfit you are wearing. 
 I have update the New Power tickets 523459 and523444 for the 13th-15. 
 FLARE IT!! 
 Nope.  Just bring a smile. 
 I sold 10000 day (deal 536976) starting on the 20th at $9.15 to New Power. Please bookout this deal with 536977 (purchase at FOM index pricing). 
 2:00 pm at my desk then. 
 I would like to spend 20 min with you today.  I need to update my Gas Daily buy/sells for December and I would like for you to see it.  It takes me about 10 min a day to do. 
 Please add Tricia Spence to this email.  She will be working with me on the CGAS volumes. 
 That's fine.  I will assume New Power is physically taking the Tetco and Trco marketarea gas unless you sell it back. 
 I added a demand charge of $93,835 to the Oglethorpe ticket for December. 
 Take a look and let me know what you think.  Also, please check the volumes. ENA's bid is in yellow. 
 I created deal 536707 for this gas.  This has nothing to do with the voodoo deals I do with Jeff Porter.  We need to schedule this. 
 Please send all VNG transport items to Vickie but cc me as well.  Thanks

 What are you going to Chicago for? 
 I do not see a Sitara deal ticket for Tagg #NR6345.A, a Trco Z6 sell to New Power for Mar and Apr 2001. 
 I updated the worksheet with a little more info and I added Trco and Tetco Marktet area information.  I did this quickly so let me know if something doesn't look right.  On Monday, we will show you a bid for the Tetco and Trco volumes.  Also, the Tetco and Trco volumes are monthly and the CGAS volumes are daily. 
 I guess you and Muffy better be snuggling to stay warm. 
 Attached are my calculations of the IF volumes for CGAS.  I will also try to update this schedule for the AGL production area volumes.  I have also included the CGAS NX1 deals.  I feel good about the NX1 volumes for Jan and Feb, I not sure about the Mar forward volumes yet.  I will keep working on thei sheet. 
 Does this work?  You don't read your emails do you?Call me before 11:20 am and I'll give you a dollar. 
 Should we release the VNG capacity to ENA effective 1/1/2001?  If yes, then what time frame (one year)? 
 Take a look at my worksheet and we will go over it.  It's mind boggeling. 
 I'm checking all my deals and found I need to add the following.  Bookout deal 533305 with 533306 (volume of 688 day for the 1st - 31st).  Bookout deal 533317 with deal 533319 (volume of 5000 day for the 5th - 31st).  The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475.  This is not a bookout, One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal 516286.  We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool.  The volume on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day.  Just a note, since I think the purchase deal should be killed, this would make us 520,000 shorter for the month in Sitara.  I left a voicemail for Mike Garred to verify. 
 We sold the 1533 / day to Allegheny - deal 459226.  This is back on a month to month basis.  We don't know if we are selling them gas for Dec yet. 
 For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.  Effective 12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.  I made the following adjustments to deal 473190, took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31 extended the deal to Jan 2001 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444 changed 1/2/2001 - 1/31/2001 to 2414  This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 1500 day in Jan.  Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.  I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13)  plus  48025 )  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.  Egan is showing a balance of 134,302. This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.  No big deal, I just want to make sure we don't leave any gas in parking. 
 Welcome Volunteers!!  Beavy, since you are going to be out, and most of our work will be done next week, I will start giving Tricia "to do's" and you can catch up later.  I have a meeting at 3:00 PM today.  I would like to give you both a quick 15 min preview before then if possible.  Let me know.  Tricia,  Please run a "monthly facilitaion by location" report for "The New Power Company" for both MarketEast and East for Jan 2001 and Jan-Dec 2001.  I don't know if you can run the Jan-Dec 2001 on one report.  Tricia, if we do the 15 min meeting today, I would like to have 3 copies of the Jan 2001 facilitation.  I create a ton of bookout deals for New Power  and I always start with the CPR report.    Thanks. 
 Nothing new to report.  I received an official copy of the inventory list last night.  I will try to get it notorized and mailed back to the lawyer today. 
 The $10,000 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for the New Power Market Area.  We are still working on the East demand charges, they are not correct.  I will probably add the East demand charges to a CGLF sales deal. 
 Found it. 
 YES WE ARE!! 
 We should have some impact from the following deals 456630, 456638, and 414075. I increased the price on 414075. 
 Hey team.  I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the following FOM numbers  1st-6th  51,762 7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st 27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st  Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through the 25th.  Not as much as I thought. 
 Who's gonna pay for my popcorn?  Did you like that pumpkin? 
 Remember the Titans!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I entered deal 454356 in Sitara.  ENA inherited this deal from CES.  This is a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline.   I entered all the pricing and volume terms on the comments.  P.S.  Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra. 
 Scott Goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at AEP, and his number is 614-324-5038.  Scott is THE MAN! 
 Done deal 454150 
 28213  I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.  Est Citygate for Nov  43,213 Storage Withdrawal  15,000  Net Purchase from ENA  28,213   Does this look correct?  We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).  AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are maintaining.  Do you want to try and do away with any of them?  All I really need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone. 
 Sean may want to go to this. 
 The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power for the gas taken out of storage.  In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 11/1/2000.  Take a look - let me know if you have any comments. 
 Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.  Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on the worksheet.  So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.  Comments? 
 Deal 452810 is an ENA sale to New Power at IF + .0075 for 10,000 dth day starting on the 27th.  New Power is selling this gas to Aquilla. 
 Steve Stonestreet said you have an email address for our team.  I would like to have that please.   I need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in November.  thanks 
 Jeff Westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe.  I attached September, is this the month you are looking for? 
 I checked the CGLF and CGAS capacity against Navigator.  Take a look and let me know what you think.  Also, do you know the demand charges for the CGAS items highlighted in purple? 
 Did everyone see this? 
 Kim, please forward to the traders.  I think the schedulers have this already.     Please forward:  Room Change 
 Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now. We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary (be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.  She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.  I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?  I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!  Later 
 Update, Scott and I are still looking at the storage numbers.  We hope to have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers. 
 CNG has new commodity rates effective 11/1/2000  New  Old $.0973  $.0462  Fuel remains unchanged at 2.28%. 
 We both ran out of gas.  I just happened to be 20 ft from the gas station when I did it.  That was the first time we went by the skydive place. 
 Run facilitation by location reports for November 1st for  Columbia Energy Services ???(Inc I think)  and  The New Power Company  and   Enron Energy Services, Inc.  thanks 
 Call me buddy.  Ingrid wants to come over and do a dog and pony show about Transco's new ??system?? I think.  AND I suggested she meet with EES and ENA at the same time.  I'm thinking around the 1st week in November.  What do you think? 
 I need to check this one.  We have several contracts with evergreen clauses. I didn't think this one had an evergreen clause but maybe it did. 
 I changed the end term date on cglf k#50250 from 10/31/2000 to 7/31/2001. 
 I changed the end date on CGLF k#42789 (deal 156388) to 10/31/2001. 
 Correction on the 4,018 dth from CPA (offer #30496), the receipt point is Broad Run, not Leach. 
 Are you guys looking for people?  I have a call from an ex KN Energy lady looking for a job.  Name  Sharon Dale Beavers Phone 281-397-85285  Let me know. 
 I know, tell all the women you know. 
 I meant the top 4 contracts 
 You are correct.  The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one is released to ENA.  I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's contracts to ENA. 
 I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this deal ticket.  Let me know if there are any problems.  This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New Power. 
 Opps.  You don't work for CES anymore. 
 Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I won't execute these until I hear from you.            The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff gave us the OK on this one. 
 CGAS storage looks good.  We are still working on the ohters.  I should have a better feel by tomorrow afternoon. 
 You're on! 
 Judy bought some new capacity on TRCO  Term  10/20/2000 - 10/31/2000 MDQ  20,000 Rec  St 62 Delivery St 65 k#  3.7145 
 5.215 by 5.225, I bought 5.235, thought it was going up 
 5.205 by 5.215 
 No can do on lunch next week.  How about after work at that little Italian place (i think) close to St Thomas High School?  We talked about this place before 
 Come chat with me when you get a chance.  I see you are not at your desk, as usual. 
 Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ? 
 I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th.  This is a bookout.  The volumes on these deals should always match, if they don't then I goofed. 
 Please send me the August invoice for CES.  Did we do any manual billings for August?  I need those too. 
 hey you, everything is still the same but here they are just as a double check  Zone Comm  Fuel 1-1 .0653  .35% 2-2 .0694  .46% 3-3 .0792  .45% 
 Give me a copy of the invoice.  thanks 
 I just called Lincoln Life - Dad's mutual fund.  He will mail me the forms to fill out today. 
 James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the contract:  MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000 The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and discounted demand of $6.08 If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61  What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 4723 day. What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61. 
 I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon.  Could you email me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August? 
 Let me know the deal # after you enter it in Sitara.  Thanks 
 We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.  We will have to pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me.  The lawyer said we may have to buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose. 
 I think everyone needs a good wife! 
 I didn't go to the shipper meeting.  We sent Sean Boyle, he's an ex CNG guy that works for us now.  You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back when.  He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group.  My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air.  No new news - I hope to find out more next week.  Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later!  Tell Muffy I said hi! 
 If I remember correctly, I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from someone else.  The delivery point on CNG was NIMO.  And this was the only time we ever used the agency on CNG. 
 ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.  I believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.  ENA released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and we wanted to transfer title at the pool.  I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning. He is terminating the agency. 
 Did you call me?  I have a message from Mike at 3-5480.  It ain't your voice on voicemail. 
 Cute, I want one!! 
 I will be out the week of the 13th. 
 5.605 by 5.615, 
 Please forward to Don, my email is not going through. 
 My fault.  Try it again.  I just released the deal. 
 I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via interoffice to Jeff.  There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.  How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal. 
 5.64 by 5.65 
 Jeff said he is still not seeing these 2 deals for September.  These are the deals I entered in Sitara yesterday for Sep.  Would you check on them and let me know what you find out? 
 I'm having a problem sending this to Don.  What is eamil? 
 I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better winter riding gear.  We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should only take about five minutes.  That's all I have for now. 
 Oh now you're teasing me!  I went riding last night.  I think I need some winter motorcycle gear.  My brother and I are taking a biking trip in November - don't know where we are going yet.  How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now? 
 We are missing 2 deals, 433359 (sale) and 433385 (purchase).  Please redraft and let me know if you see these. 
 5.245 by 5.255 
 I need your SS #'s for my beneficiary form.  Jerry, please forward to Don, I couldn't email him the other day. 
 Hey team, I know you guys are concerned about my welfare so I'm taking vacation.  I will be off on Tuesday Oct 17th and the week of Nov 13th-17th. 
 I took a 1/2 day of vacation yesterday, the 5th. 
 4.43 by 4.44 
 Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 11/1/99 - 4/30/01.  Is this considered retail or wholesale? I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.  Is that correct? 
 Nuthin I want to put in writing. 
 I want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink.  Oh yea, you already did!    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different format. 
 I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to $1,194,758.  This is on deal 508891.  Would you please send out an adjustment for the decrease to New Power?  Thanks  My fault for not correcting it sooner. 
 Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September.  I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.  David and I discussed this.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, everything should be billed through the system. 
 Please redraft the New Power September activity.  I'm looking for the deals shown below AND there should be a demand charge of $892,040.00 on deal 377245 and a demand of $624,028.00 on deal 381811.  If you see the items above, please send me a new worksheet.  Thanks 
 Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000   Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment 47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes below 4,723 per day. Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.  21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below  21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below   Comments: If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  Questions for Tennessee; What are the rates for October? Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or monthly quantities? 
 I just entered the following 2 deals in Sitara for September, deals 433359 and 433385.  Please path these deals in Unify.  Thanks 
 Oh my, he's a big fella.  The quality looks great. 
 I'm scheduling it. 
 $9.50 by $9.60 
 Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270?  I am still estimating about $5,000 per month. 
 Call me, lets chat. 
 I have 17 days of vacation.  I'm rolling over 5 days which means I have 12 days left.  I think I can easily take off a week in November.  How about you? 
 We bought back some of New Powers first of the month volumes on deal 431846. Please match this deal with 431849.  I did this deal on the 5th and its effective the 7th - 31st. 
 Yes I wuz! 
 I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together somehow.  I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get in their groups and talk.  Let me know what you guys think.  I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob Supperty about this,. 
 We need to confirm all the data on Mark's worksheet.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify. 
 Who handles the billing for Ashland Chemical? 
 Hey Don, I'm still working on this.  I should have an idea by this Wed. 
 Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to BUG if this happens. 
 I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.  As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and liability) relationships.  Comments/questions?? 
 Adams Automotive at 713-932-0934. They are located at 1010 Blalock, across from the Fiesta, off I-10.  They may be a little pricey, but you can trust them.They only to do what is needed, and their service is excellent!!!  I'm glad you like the sweatpants. It turned cold and rainy today. I should be wearing mine today!!!  I got me a townhome... the contract will be signed on Tuesday. I really like it. It is 3 Bedroom and 2.5 baths with a garage. Faces the woods, Muffy will have fun exploring.  Thanks again for driving us here safely. 
 Robin, I can never remember if NYPA is your customer or Craig's - AND I can't find him in my email directory. 
 I created a new deal because this one has so much data on it. 
 I'm putting the freezing one on my webpage with a few happy hour photo's as soon as I get off my lazy butt. 
 Chat with Sean, I don't know if the room is big enough for everyone. 
 Smart call on your part.  NOW we are using long haul FT to serve Doyel instead of IT.  Whew! 
 NEWS FLASH!!!!  The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem. 
 You don't care about me? 
 Call me I got a question 
 NYMX now at 5.155 by 5.165, YOU MADE ME STRONG - out at 5.265 
 no rush, call me when you get a chance 
 You can set up your own photo album online. 
 I bought 5.22, the bid is now at 5.28, what should i do? 
 I'm looking at last night's New Deal report.  I see deal 425325 with a loss of $236,000, but I don't see deal 425332 with a big positive number anywhere.  Any ideas? 
 Do we still have any activity or imbalances on the following Columbia Energy Services contracts  k# 8G0a61 8g0a62 8g0a63 8g1064 8t0a61 8t0a62 8t1063 8t1064

 Is that a digital or film camera? 
 FINALLY, it's about time we hear from you.  I'm glad you're focused on schoolwork.  That's where your mind should be anyway.  I'll plan on seeing you on Nov 4th. 
 Transco response 
 Jerry and I bought motorcycles.  I LIKE!  Are you still looking at getting a camera - an ELPH??  Is that a digital? 
 You Bet.  I may have you a helmet too. 
 Call me or Beverly at 853-6357 
 That contract should also be on the list.  I sent something to VNG about that.  I'll follow up on it.  GOT my mototcycle - guess what I did all weekend after my little East Texas Trip.  I need to get a tattooee now. 
 Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of November.  The invoices are on their way, I think it would be easier to sort and review the data in excel.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I've never heard from the dude.  I may send him a voicemail. 
 Once again you've made me proud! 
 We added a Transco meter to deal 30512 today.  Would you make sure none of that goofy financial stuff is impacted please? 
 Update  Jerry and I went to East Texas this weekend.  we withdrew $750.00 from the Fredonia bank and I'm going to deposit that in the Credit Union.  I also took the petty funds in the kitchen drawer - $72.00.  AND we did get $2,000.00 deposited into Dad's account from the Credit Union.  later dudes 
 Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables are netting to 0.  For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment to Clinton.  Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money! 
 Would you send Marlene a copy of the Equitrans agreement next week?  Thanks

 Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.  VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.  Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time.  During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the capacity.  Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the capacity non-biddable.  I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me.   Dick suggested I tell you.  TAGG - you're it, I will await your command.  Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec.

 Come on now!!! yes. 
 You guys may know this already.  This contract only has 1% fuel when you take gas from Emporti to the VNG citygate.  k#65066, MDQ = 38,000   We can learn  more about this contract later. 
 Correction deal 418015 is really 418051. 
 I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;  Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.  Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).  Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG deal, a confirm is faxed to them.  AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet. 
 Date correction, Dec 14, not Nov 14. 
 Robin, this is for the 5500 dth/day baseload sale and the 5500 dth/day put option in Tenn Z4.  This is Mo's deal.  Dick Jenkin's believes we should be paying a demand charge.  I 
 You De Man! 
 Probably won't get to it until after the 1st is done.  I think it will be easy to figure out though. 
 Hmmm.   Victor Guggenheim?  OPPPPS. 
 I may still be here working on this new deal.  Or I may be drinking beer at Little Woodrow's. 
 Nope. 
 I need the WSS meter number.  I would like to get that from VNG.  I'm sure we don't have that set up in our system. 
 There's always a profit in gen-tile and calm.  I'm Judy's boy.  I know nothing about Vickie.

 Take a look at my worksheet and let me know what you think.  Look at column H in the Daily Activity tab, this shows my actual daily and monthly injections.  Also, on 9/16/200, we did a storage transfer to NIPSCO for 500,000 dth.  Our total capacity is 6,050,607 dth.  We have all the tariff rules in the Strg Rules tab.

 When did Bay State bill ENA for this?  And, did Bay State pay there bill for gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment?  It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09. 
 I sold the Niagara/Nat Fuel back to the Central Desk for the rest of the month.  Please take the 16,500 dt of Trco Z6 to Z6 space to 0 in Sitara for the balance of the month.  Thanks 
 Russ verified that agency transport capacity deals can be set up in Sitara before the agency contract is in Global.  That makes things quicker for Scott and I. 
 Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

 Hi there.  We changed our CGAS storage numbers today and we have fixed the Sitara deals and worksheet. 
 Boo 
 Looks good with the following changes.  If you see these changes come through then its good to go.  Thanks   The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041, just corrected in Sitara. Added demand charge of $1,233,260 to deal 508891. Added demand charge of $647,256 to deal 380571. 
 Don't make any changes for now.  I need to draft a more detailed memo. 
 S Jersey sold 35,000 day Z3-Z6 for Oct, non recallable at $.08, variable = $.31, its about $.05 in the money. 
 6:45 or so works real well for me.  Where do you guys want to feed me? 
 Where do you guys want to take me? 
 What if we did this tonight?  I have a work shindig tomorrow night that I just found out about. 
 Jerry, this may be news to you.  I would like for the 3 of us to have dinner Thursday evening and you are buying.  Comments - questions? 
 AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.  The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following  Sales Price  $5.4850 Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident) Storge Injection  $.0249 Capacity Demand $.0400  Total Price  $5.7025  We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).  Thanks 
 opened $9.50 by $9.60 now $9.25 by $9.35 
 Would you send me the purchases?  thanks 
 Effective 9/15/00 ENA sold NIPSCO 500,000dth storage see deal #401601. Adjusted the deal # 268093 & #268090 on the CGAS storage worksheet. Please make the necessary changes in TAGG        Tks Chris 
 According to Brenda we owe Egan 101 dts (per Egan's statement) on the expired Egan storage contract.  Jesse, would you verify this with Egan and find out what they want to do?  Thanks 
 Dick, use this worksheet to calculate NIPSCO's price.  Scott, Dick may have you look at this.  The prices in Column H are for capacity demand charges. 
 Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong.  The FSS balance is 797,464 and the ISS balance is (797,771).  This is better.  We need to pay back another 307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer.  I know you guys will make me proud. 
 However, I will be flying out of Baltimore Monday morning and I'll be dressing business causal.  I'm leaving tonight. 
 I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of (797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.  Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling this please?  Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.  Thanks 
 I added Meredith's photo to the web page below last night. 
 I will be out this Friday, Next Monday and Tuesday.  Dan will be out Monday but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore. Judy is out in the afternoons.  So, that leave Scott, Vickie, and myself.  Vickie's role has not been fully explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow. 
 I gave to Kim Olinger. 
 Jim, deal 226121 is our long term CNG pool sale to EES - the volume is around 1,000/day each month.  Deal 348393 is our wonderful sale to you behind EOG for July and August.  Whats up? 
 That means you didn't send me the attachment. OR if you did, I don't see it. 
 Where are the actuals coming from?  Is this someone changing the supply matched up with the Clinton deal? 
 I'm here.  Judy and Scott Goodell are out. 
 I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).  This is a sale to Transco at St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.  I also entered a transport usage deal 399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.  This deal captures the commodity cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.  Comments/Questions?

 I killed deal 396265 and added the demand charge to deal 124109. 
 I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.  This is a Market East desk deal. I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept having problems saving the deal so I created a new one.  Let me know if this works. 
 I just deleted the External demand charge on deal 233091.  I wonder if there should be an Internal demand charge for $.09? 
 We are at a $5.44 in storage on CGAS.  I don't think I can give you anything on CNG but I'm still checking.  Just assume I can't and I call you if I find something.  The screen went up $.20 today. 
 I have Steve and Lisa on the internet at this web address  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp  Enter the account name "trogg522" in the box on the bottom right. 
 Help!  You are wonderfull! 
 We increased our CNG demand charges by $26,400 today. 
 I called you.  No anwser. 
 i don't care if you delete it.  its of steve gillespie and his wife. 
 Do you have a copy of Maureen's deal ticket? 
 TP #6562, North Carolina Nat Gas,  is a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. TP #6068 is the Trasnco interconnect with Col Gas at Dranesville.  This point is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. The meter number for Public Serv. NC is TP #6608, and this is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. 
 Baby shower photo from last night. 
 I was going to send you a photo of your woman from the baby shower but I can't load it from work.  I'll send it to you next week. 
 Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.  Example:  See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.  I was concerned that we would double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on the Physical Forward sale as well. 
 Vickie gave me an open season notice on Transco's Momentum Expansion Project.  Bids are due Thursday, Sep 29th.  Momentum is expected to be in service by 5/1/2003.  Shippers can elect the following receipt points, St 65, St 85, or Destin. The primary delivery point is St 165.  The minimum term is 15 years.  I will still be here doing transport. 
 This impacts the following deals in Sitara,  Deal 222734 - purchase from Alliance Deal 265943 - purchase from Meng Deal 227992 - transport usage 
 I justed asked dick, vickie is taking over Dan's job.  Does that mean transport??? EOL??? dick doesn't know. 
 I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file.  Before the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32.  After the change its (CGAS - $.30)x(1-.0492).  This widens the spread by about $.24. 
 I need a Destin class.  The only think I know about Destin is that its a Transco Z4 Mainline Point. 
 SST and we always assume we are using FTS. 
 You changed the rate on this deal from $.0227 to $.0358 effective 8/5/00. What's up with that girl? 
 I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.  It has very big volumes on it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.  Joanne just verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.  This will be a big OA variance for June - August.  This deal is for deliveries to Storage.  Would you verify if ACA and GRI are billed for storage deliveries please? 
 You are funny.  I laughed for 5 min when I saw this. 
 I'm there! 
 I changed deals 268090 and 268093 effective 9/7/2000.  We plan to have storage maxed out by 9/30/2000 and there will be no injections for October.  Comments, questions??  Will this cause any problems with the Choice program in October? 
 What are deal tickets 299159 and 299192? 
 I'm looking for an invoice from El Paso Field Services for July 2000 production.  The rate should be $.05 and the volume should be around 37,000.  Have you seen such a thing? 
 I'm all over it.  I have 2 plane tickets, one for Monday evening, the 18th, at 5:20pm and one for Tuesday morning,  19th, at 6:45am.  Knowing what a wonderfull morning person you are, I will probably leave Monday evening.  AND I will be in town next weekend.  Who is giving you a pool party?? 
 With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the delivery points.  I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact on what we flow in Z6.  Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let me know if you need specific capacity examples. 
 Opps.  I made an error.  This is a Sep 2000 contract.  I changed the term on deal from 6/1/2000 - 9/30/2000 to 9/1/2000 - 9/30/2000.

 I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco.  If we no longer have a need to be agent, I think we should terminate those agencies. What do you think? 
 You need to give me a boottle in a  brown bag. 
 I thought I would sleep in the car, or maybe a shelter. 
 Shipper Meeting 
 I reserved a one-way ticket on Continental last night for 6:45am Tuesday, 19th.  It cost $263.00 and its completly refundable.  Sounds good to me.   I told the reservation lady that I was thinking about buying 2 tickets and just get my money back for the one I don't use.  I would buy one leaving Monday evening and the one for Tuesday morning  COOL, don't you think?

 Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect. Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss how to correctly handle this in our system.  We also have some other supply behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly. Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East Ohio??? Any others?  People I need in attendance Mary Theresa or Jeanne Steve Gillespie Angie Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group)  This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet. I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the deals to this new pipeline. Steve, get the Peoples password from Angie.  I need you to go into escript (Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this system.  These are actually CES passwords.  It is my intention to use this information to set up transport or pooling contracts in Sitara. 
 Uhhhh - - - - - - -  Yea.  Whoo Hooo.  Hold me back.   I feel the excitement.  Just kidding, hope your day is full of wonders!!! 
 The PPL contract number for September is 523489, volume= 2,400. 
 Dick wants to over inject as much as possible for the holiday weekend.  I adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.  We will inject 31,463 on the 1st, and 31454 on the 2nd-5th.  Our injections drop to 25172 on the 6th. 
 Colleen, we still show the 1,000 dt/day of Equitrans capacity on our CES (now New Power) sheet.  Do you know if CES ever agreed to take this contract? 
 I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.    I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 4/1/2001.  Pros Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing guru like myself. Will learn a great deal about transport pricing. May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con) Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk P&L.    Cons Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be. May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions. I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer. I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm very detail oriented. I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the job very serious. 
 I made a few small changes to the storage balances on CGAS.  I had to create a new deal ticket starting Sep 1st because the name changed from CES to "The New Power Company".  Joanne,  I made a change to Aug 31st.  Kyle, I think you need to change tagg.  Let me know if anyone has questions.

Paul, you should be able to execute this space before 9:00 am and re-release it to me (company #7973).  thanks. 
 Kimat, I think either 226553 or 372096 + 227882 should be taken to 0 for September.  I'm taking deal 226553 to 0 for now.

 I must have deleted the GRI memo I had.  Sorry about that.

 I copied deal 226703 to 380492 for Sep forward and changed the counterparty to New Power.  Robert, The volumes for deal 380492 are included in the FOM citygate sale. Bookout deal 380492 with 380503. 
 Hey woman, how much vacation do I have left BEFORE i fill out a timesheet for the 2nd part of August? 
 The Power Gas Marketing supply for Sep is 3,000 DTH. 
 Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.  Take a look at my worksheet.  All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale. Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.  What about deal 202939?  Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very confusing the way I do it. 
 Ignore my previous email.  For now, just book out deal 372088 with deals 229344 and 229357. 
 Supply deal 376962 gets booked out with sale deals 227882 and 372096.  Effective October 1st forward, deal 372048 gets booked out with 227882.   Supply deal 372088 gets booked out with sale deals 229344 and 229357. 
 I need to hold the New Power invoice until Monday.  It should be ready to send out Monday afternoon and everything should be captured in Sitara. 
 We may be carrying some of our NFUL payback balance into September.   The firm portion of the contract will terminate on 8/31/2000.  However, the payback part of the deal is IT and NFUL will let us carry this balance into September.  On the 30th, we will move our balance on deal 318682 into September.  NFUL will give us until September 11th to payback our balance. 
 I just sent you National Fuel Gas Supply contracts.   The contact at National Fuel contact is Joseph Bettinger, Senior Manager-Interstate Marketing Department.  Address 10 Lafayette Square Buffalo, NY  14203 
 Please send the CNG stuff to  Jeffrey Keister Dominion Transmission, Inc. 445 West Main Street. Clarksburg, WV  26301 
 Jeff, welcome to the club.  We are going to send you, Ora Ash, Jeff Davis, and Cindy McGinnis some goodies.  You, Ora, and Jeff will get Enron shirts. Cindy gets a jacket.  Don't try selling this stuff on the street, OK?  I will be checking to make sure you pass the "goodies" on. 
 Some questions about the 1st.  Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 dt/day.  This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply? 
 On September 26-28, Temmessee is doing work at the Lockport compressor station, which is accross the river from Transcanada.  This work will impact the amount of gas Nat Fuel can receive from TCPL at Niagara.  Max capacity is around 429,000 dth.  During the work, the estimated capacity wil be 300,000 dth.  Nat Fuel will have to cut firm shippers.   429,000 300,000 
 Chic-fil-a???  No problem 4,053,906 sounds good. 
 Good job Chris.  My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  Comments? 
 Perfect.  I will buy you one free coke!! 
 call me 
 Have fun.  Gas prices are going through the roof 
 Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I think I see whats happening.  I believe deal 372088 is a bookout with deals 229344 and 229357.  Should it also be a bookout with deal 227882?  What about deals 169036and 217764?  What about dea 
 Please take a look at deal 372088.  Its a new deal that starts Sep 1st and it was entered in sitara on Aug 21st.  I changed the counterparty from CES to New Power. 
 Hi Team.  I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.  Effective September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.  All existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara.  If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to "The New Power Company".  Thanks 
 Thanks.  This all started last November - where did the time go??       Clayton Vernon @ ENRON 08/23/2000 04:28 PM 
 Angie, would you go into Unify on July 31st and change the pathed volume to Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551. Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction. 
 AND my COH balance effective 7/31/2000 is 4,053.932 ( a difference of 26dt's). 
 Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and monthly activity.  If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on April 30th was 13%.  Let me know if you have questions. 
 I'm not above groveling for affection. 
 Hi gang.  Please read the following and let me know what you think.  Also, what would be the best way to handle this. 
 I will be updating deals 523459 and 523444.  This is a bookout.  I have these deals updated through the 5th 
 I didn't buy it yet.   But I going to take a serious look at it. 
 I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well (other than the price).  I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the deal.  You have not sold it to anyone have you?  If not, I'm going to try to sell it to EES for the term.  And if I remember correctly, the volume is 10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000, correct?

 Miss me?  Apparently not - no hugs from you.  Who is doing my Market area stuff and why didn't Alicia tell me she was leaving??  I guess we aren't the item I thought we wuz. 
 OK.  When accounting did their initial draft for June production, we had a volume of 1,089,120 on deal ticket 268094.  Today, this same deal ticket has a volume of 497,015.  I think this  was loaded back from Unify.  Can we get that fixed? 
 Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will get that fixed. 
 IT WORKS!!! 
 How's this??

 We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals.  Clinton (Latrove) should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool.  The Power Gas Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 30th and then we will be out of the local production business.  We've tried to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it. Sorry.

 Hey buddy, can you just send me $20.00???  I won't be around for the happy hour. 
 I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora on the National Fuel deal.  After adjusting for what we took out today, we owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth.  Here are the points that I believe will work best  Tenn/Colden (meter #060003)  Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply. Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072)  Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG. Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost. 
 Thanks for pointing this out.  To my knowledge we have never even tried to overlap the contract or do any segmenting.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey buddy.  I would love to take a tour.  I'm tied up with a family illness for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me.  Great Idea though.

 Wade, please forward this to the person that pays Statoil.  AND I just faxed you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me.  I believe Heidi Boyd told me that ENA was not  making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.  Let me know what you find out.  Please include Scott Goodell on all responses. 
 Hi gang.  I will be out of the office quite a bit over the next 4 weeks. Please make sure you copy Scott and Molly on all emails and send all faxes to Scott Goodell, just to make sure we don't miss anything.  Thanks 
 I took off all last week.  Chad was married last Saturday, and I spent the rest of the week at Dad's and the hospital.  I talked to Jerry today - He has been up there since last Wednesday.  The Dr. said Pops has anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month.  They are taking him out of the hospital tomorrow or Wed.  I'll be going up there quite a bit for a while.  There is nothing wrong with a good heart attack. 
 This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.  According to my notes, this is an "unwind" for AK Steel.  It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September.  The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September.  CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.  The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes.  So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a price of IF CGAS + $.0075.  The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228. 
 Can you find me a woman?  You know I'm still sorta single. 
 Why yes we do and here it is.  We create a new worksheet each month.  The worksheet you are looking for is "Rates".  Assume the rate you are looking at is FT unless specified otherwise.   And, depending on what you are looking at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.  The password to modify is the filename "2000tran08".       Enron North America Corp.

 I just sold 3,000 dth to CES for July 31st, deal 348523.  Per Jeff Porter, this is an in-ground storage transfer.  Jeff is faxing me the form to transfer the gas from ENA's storage to BG&E's storage account.  The transfer needs to be completed by July 31st. 
 East Ohio I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).  This deal should get matched with the purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.  The deal volume is 10,000 for the month.  We have the Power Gas deal thru October.  We still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.  I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.  Thanks.   Peoples I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This deal also goes through October.  We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..  We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.  Let me know if anyone has questions. 
 Donnie, I prepared this email a couple weeks ago but was unable to send it because of email problems.  It was in my "save as a draft" folder.   ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14. The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put in some of the buy/sale activity.  My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy 
 As I mentioned below, we now have 17,000 dth of Z3 to Z4 space for August on k#.7537.

Effective 8/1/2000 - 9/30/2000, we have a baseload supply of 1,000 dth per day from CGAS - Young Women's, this is production gas on CGAS that will only flow to Young Women's during this time frame.  Also, Scott Hendrickson purchased 2,300 dth per day from Virginia Power at Young Women's.  We can use the ICTS contract for this gas as well.  Total Receipts at Young Women's for August is 3,300 dth. 
 This is what I show for the 1st 5 days.  We are off about 552 dth on the 2nd and the 3rd, all the other numbers seem close enough.  I had an error in my formula.

 ENA sold the 10,000 dth of EOG pool supply from Power Gas Marketing to EES for the month of August at CNG IF flat - this is the same thing we did for July. 
 Can't make it but thanks for the offer.  I do plan on coming up some time this year. 
 Can you help out my buddy Mike?  He will probably take us out for a fabulous lunch. 
 I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.  We made a mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.  I do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.  This should only be a problem for May and June, I think.  Please pay the disputed amounts. 
 I owe you big time.  Send me a bill.

 She sure did.  Molly Sumrow. 
 Kim, please note I will be on vacation all next week, Jul 31st through Aug 4th. 
 Mike, here is the worksheet.  The 2 tabs you need to use are "CES Retail East" and "CES Retail Mrkt".  Also, CGAS contract #67693 goes from 54,327 dt per day to around 108,000 dth per day starting Oct 1. 
 It probably was and at this point I don't know what is and isn't in the system. 
 As we discussed on the phone, Mike Garred with CES is requesting a copy of the CES demand charge sheet.  Please let me know if you approve. 
 7ish 
 Yo buddy!!  I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES officially.  Let me chat with Doug Kinney.  I think it will be ok.  I also told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total by Pipeline.  Get back with you soon. 
 Add the demand to the commodity, that's comes out to $.0505, there is your nickle.  However, being that we work for a marketing company and recognize the value of fuel, we take that into consideration.  The pipelines don't usually. 
 Let;s you and I chat this afternoon about getting reimburse from Oglethorpe on Transco. 
 Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th.  The start date is the 27th.  Currently there are no bids ( Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon).  The min demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth.  The commodity is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00. 
 Is Denver around the block??  How about Colorado Springs - I think its closer. 
 Hi Gang.  Transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon.  I will probably be out all week.  I believe Scott Goodell and Beverly should go and take anyone else that would like to attend. 
 Very nice - now where did you say you and I are going on vacation?  I suppose we could make it driving trip to take advantage of your new car!!!   Did some boy buy that for you? 
 FYI 
 Just spoke with Pops.  I let him know that his favorite son (ME) will be up there this evening.  He thinks I'm in Lufkin. 
 Hey, I just created a new deal for this contract effective 8/1/2000.  I thought I had done this but I can't find the other deal I created.  The new deal #is 340210. 
 Screen is 8.375 by 8.425, I'm happier! 
 I just changed the volume from 11000 to 11316 per day for the whole month. 
 Just send me $50 and we won't worry about it.  I would also like a new golf shirt but I don't think I want the name Clinton on it right now.  Try to get me an AEP shirt. 
 Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to Oglethorpe on Transco.  Current Process ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.  New Process ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 318423, gas daily deal) ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.  Curretly, this volume will match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel. 
 FYI    I requested fuel waivers from Canajoharie to Trco-Leidy for Aug and CNG said no.  I think they will still have the waivers to most of the citygates though. 
 Read below, are you interested? 
 FYI    The 4,000 the East Desk bought from Ontario for tomorrow will probably get constrained but we wanted to try it. 
 I changed the rate on transport usage deal 227992 from $.27 to .32.  Impact will be ($18,400)  I need your help  changing the curve formula - please. 
 I'll give you a call in the morning around 8:15 am.  Later Buddy. 
 Chat with Alan at EES, I bet its the same escript you currently use.   This might be one of those "let me get Alan to help me for a free lunch" things. 
 I sold CES 174 dt/day (deal 335917) from the 20th through the 31st,  at a delivered price of $4.395.  We are using ENA transport for pricing purposes. 
 Sorry dude, I don't have his number.  And I finished my first civil war book.  I'll try to get that to you.  Where should I invest my money? 
 If I made as much as those EES boys I could afford a Harley.  I have a 1995 Yamaha Virago 1100.  I like it.  I got a tattoo of a heart with your name inside it. 
 Is this something Scott did for you?  He has been handling all the TCO activity.  Let me know if this is something I need to do. 
 I tried sending this email about 3 weeks ago and had problems.   So here it is. 
 Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month.  AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime.  Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.  Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi. With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy.  Let me know what you guys think. 
 Thank you for sending my drill book.  I believe I have the key your are looking for.  I also have a "Dog Care" book that fell out of Daisy's folder when I got her out of "jail".  I will have these items delivered to you as soon as possible. 
 Go to "Bulletin Board" Select "Operationally Available" 
 Lynn Burke with the CDC's needs to release some CGAS and CGLF capacity to CES/New Power for August 2000-July 2001.  She wants to know who she should release the capacity to for August.  ???? 
 The exchange deal numbers are 323558 and 323553.  Also, I changed the rate on Tenn deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0097.    thanks

 How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free lunch and my New Power golf shirt? 
 I just changed the rate on Tenn/transport uage deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0116.  We should get back 85,155 x $.0984==$8,300 tonight. 
 Dan does not know what this contract is used for.  I think it has (or had) something to do with the Boston Gas contract.  We currently use k#29667 for that.  I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000.  Comments / questions? 
 james r barker ees      patricia downey ees  donnie myers/na/enron     ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14. The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put in some of the buy/sale activity.  My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy 
 Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.  The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective June 1.  Please look at the following contracts/deals.  Contract Deal  Comment 779234  003589  Boston releasing to CES 771157  003668  CES releasing to ENA 771224  003786  ENA releasing to Energy Express  Contract Deal  Comment 779233  003581  Boston releasing to CES 771156  003666  CES releasing to ENA 771225  003785  ENA releasing to Energy Express    Thanks. 
 I just had a thought.  Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.  You don't need to do anything with it.  Its more of an awareness type thing. 
 I have to look for the house key at home.  I know I don't have it on my keyring.

 I just changed the rate on Algon/transport usage deal 233358 from $.26 to $.0206.  We should get back 155,000 x $.2394 == $37,000 tonight. 
 Anyone there?  Helloooooo! 
 ENA purchased 11.000 dth from New Power at IF flat (deal 509454).  I created a sale deal 522203 (sale to New Power at IF + .0125).  Please Bookout these deals. 
 Rosemary's replacement. 
 Hi Gang.  Doug found my mistake and the correct price is $4.6913.  I changed the price in Sirara.  Sorry Jeff. 
 Scoop 
 Too heck with the little toot. What about that camera info??? 
 Brace yourself.  I'm putting in the June charge of $6.26 !!!  I just got the invoice today. 
 This deal is gas ENA sold to CES for Energy Express.  The daily volume was 10,322 dth (a total of 309,660 for the month).  The price is CGAS IF + $.0175 + Variable + $.02 demand for ENA transport   I just changed the price in Sitara.  My calculation shows a price of $4.6738.  Jeff, I apologize for this if you have sent out the invoice already.  Please correct the invoice for this deal and let me know when you send it out.  Thanks. 
 FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.  John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer. 
 New Power purchased A06 gas from ENA.  Please bookout dealsl 521753 (sale to New Power) with 521780 (purchase from New Power). 
 Here is the transport sheet for July.  I believe its fairly current. 
 OK - what kind of car and where are you and I going on vacation? 
 I would like to RSVP for Judy Townsend and myself.  Is it too late, will we get a free lunch, you how Judy loves a free lunch.  Also, we will not be able to attend until around 11:30 am.  Let me know it thats ok. 
 I think we should try an evening meal again.  This is fun ain't it? 
 Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.  We took all the August activity to 0.  This is how these deals should be balanced  Deal 318562 with 318686.  And 318691 with 318682.  I'll look at the economics in the morning. 
 We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.  CGAS does not bill us anything on this contract, KO does.  KO somehow gets the information from CGAS.  That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom. We don't even talk to KO anymore.  I wish KO would reference the CGAS contract on the KO invoice.  Maybe we could ask KO to do that.  I had to chat with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information. 
 I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity. I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport expense.   According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small. Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.  Questions?? 
 Let's try next week, I'm bouncing in and out this week. And THANKS!!! 
 I entered 3 deals that I do not want included in the P&L tonight.  They are all purchases from New Power  Deals 521336 521342 521345 
 I love Chic Fil A!@!! 
 I'm going over the Park & Loan discounts on CNG for May.  I need to see the invoice to compare what we were billed to what CNG is showing on the discount letter.  Gloria, Terry does not have the invoice.  Could you get me a copy please?  Thanks. 
 Colleen, this is the email response I received.  Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company called "Capacity Center"?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is authorizing these payments.  Thanks.

 Yep.  Went to Dad's on Sat, left Mon before lunch.  Took my woman and went to Jerry's on July 4th.  Had a good time.  He does a good job cooking on his BBQ pit.  I was very tired on Wed though. 
 Not a problem.  She can stuff the little sucker if I get all the other stuff.  I'll start working on that 50 lbs right after I finish this cookie. 
 Not hardly.  Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle, let me get my flying licenses, and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle?  I will also need to travel back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family. 
 How's that going anyway?  I forgot I had a marriage "arrangement" in the works! 
 Let me know when you want to chat about NYPA.  It should only take about 15 min.  I would like Beverly present because someday I would like to be agent for NYPA on their contract. 
 What about my camera info????? 
 Shame on you :o) 
 Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve CanFibre.  However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.  Per Marde, CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.  OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre. 
 We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July.  The parking deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558.  When we get cut by an upstream or downstream pipeline, Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the supplies and markets. 
 Joanie Veselack is leaving.  She is going to PG&E in Bethesda 
 The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and the deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from all other deals.  Please let me know if there are any questions. 
 I will enter this deal in the system and let you guys know what the deal number is. 
 We are borrowing 110,000 dth (deal 322012) on Transco on the 30th and paying the gas back on July 1st (deal 322007).  We are paying Trco a one time fee of $.0386 (see below)  Volume   Fee 0 to 50,000  $.015 50,001 to 100,000 $.05 100,001 to 110,000 $.10 
 I'm still looking for other emails. 
 I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you an update. 
 Dick will be doing some deals with New Power that is seperate from the "Asset Management" deal.  Following are the spot deals Dick has done with Mike Garred  Deal  Vol  Price  Comment 516083  10000  8.00  sell to NP for the 5th at the pool 521475  20000  8.28  sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP. 510586  1435  7.20  buy from NP at WGL on the 1st 513896  1500  7.25  buy from NP at WGL on the 2nd-4th   These deals have no impact on the "asset management" deal with New Power. 
 FYI.  Also take a look at today's Gas Daily 
 Hey, send them again.  I don't have them. 
 I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th holiday.  I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.

 Jesse, I put in a buy deal to purchase the gas back from CES, deal 318748.   Robert, I entered a buy and a sale to capture the financial difference on CGAS, deals 318749 and 318750.  I may kill these deals if ENA purchases the gas back from CES at Mainline.  I'll keep you posted.

 ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio (10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks like this pool can be terminated.  Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this after the 4th.  Let me know if anyone has any questions. 
 Dick has this in at a $6.89, I assume you are ok with saving $2,250 on the $.005. 
 JD is a dead man.   Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch! 
 The password is 2000tran07 
 John, call me when you get a chance.  I called 330-493-7790 and there is no voicemail. 
 I show no sales to CES for the month of July.  I created deal 315460 to bookout with deal 217769 and deal 315471 to bookout with deal 223967.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 FYI.  I changed the meter number on this deal from IMB-508914 to 9170.  They are both Trco Non NY. 
 Hey Buddy!  I just had a chat with Kori.  She is very sad she didn't get a birthday kiss from you.  There will be a little birthday bash on Friday July 7th and she will be there.  What do you think? 
 I would like to RSVP for Chad's party. 
 At my Dad's Sat and Sun.  Watching fireworks with Ingrid probably Mon or Tues.  We can go drinking one nite. 
 {Cough cough cough, Facial Expression Facial Expression}   SURE!  Ruggles on me! 
 If its Stephanie you die!  I'm working on killing JD now. 
 We have a new backhual contract from Transco.  Term  12/8/2000 - 12/31/2000 Demand $.07 k#  3.7714 Volume  5,000 Rec  Zone 6 Del  Zone 1   I just set this up in Sitara.  Please try to set up an activity number on this contract this afternoon.  Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 3, 2 to 3, or 3 to 3.  We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle. 
 Hi gang.  I have not changed anything on the storage deals since the middle of last week.  I am still showing our projected ending balance on June 30th to be 3,626,785 dth.  Let me know if you see something different.  Thanks 
 Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas into CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.   You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).  thanks 
 as soon as you vgive me back my ice chest 
 Hey buddy.  We are having all sorts of problems with St 30, 90% internal. You should try to sell to someone else if possible.  Maybe Williams?? 
 Went home and went to bed buddy!  So which of the lovely young ladies did you spend time with? 
 Tim, call Dick Jenkins about this capacity.  His number is 3-5136 
 This transaction involves 5 contracts.  Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of ($.125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months.  I don't think Nat Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out. 
 My location is EB 3224b  and anyday after 3:45PM is good for me.  Thanks

 Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.  IAS  <== we just created k# A02353 ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262 FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.   Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork to legal and I need it back by Monday morning. 
 I called Peoples, Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any questions.  I also received one voice mail from the Can Fibre guy and I have not heard from him either.  Don't seem like anything is getting done.  I hope you had a good weekend. 
 Modest Too!! 
 What happened to all my emails?  How's my Duff?  What's going on? 
 We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS.  FSS We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day. However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.  COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.  Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.  Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today's prices that cost about $.105  Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.  Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.  Let me know if you have any questons. 
 Hey Rhonda, my sources tell me that this $3.324 is the correct price. Thats a big bonus for EES. 
 Check out this site:  > http://www.ozmasplace.cjb.net > 
 Good job.  Now what price should we bill EES. 
 Hey Greg.  Hope this works.  My phone number is 713-853-4743. 
 We currently have the following transport contracts on CNG for July.  k#  MDQ  Comment 5A2500  15000  Oak to BG&E  5A2551  4003  Corn to BG&E 5A2551  383  Lebanon to BG&E  5A2526  3947  Corn to Leidy  Total  23,333 dt   Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July.  And we can still take 7950 dth from Cornwell. 
 Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.  k# 560104 5A2529 
 ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is correct?  Thanks 
 Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?  I want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility.  Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments for your year end review.  Thanks. 
 You make it sound like you are going away for good.  I'll see you when you come back. 
 Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel. I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.  Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not. 
 You will probably get an invitation to the wedding.  The date is Sat, July 29th, in Mangum, OK. at 3:00pm in the afternoon.  I'll expect to see you.

 I'm not sure if it matters but it will make it easier to find, I think. 
 So both of these suppliers are now fixed price because  they locked in the NYMX?

 Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will.  Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing. Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?  Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? If yes, how many meters?  2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume  Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.  Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this. 
 How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)?

 Hi 
 Call Chris at you convience about EES/CES. 
 Cool 
 Bid is bouncing around $4.03 to $4.06 
 This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent.  Doyle is .8 miles off the Transco mainline.  What do you think?  I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to Transco.  It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St 65. 
 Test.  Does this work? 
 AGA is 78.  Screen dipped to $3.95, currently at $4.05 / $4.06 
 Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal.  Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

 Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet.  The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.  We currently have 20,000 dt in the sitara.  We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes.  thanks 
 Let us update the pricing and we will send you a confirm today or tomorrow. 
 We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.  It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.  The transport usage deal is 289228.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, $4.455, and $4.475.  Comment? 
 I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month.  On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth. On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.  This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000. 
 Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid ENA for October activity? 
 Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a problem but just in case. 
 I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals.  However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000.  Transco Offers #20100 for 15 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.4899, Wharton to Algon #20101 for 5 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.8607, Wharton to Algon  CNG Offers #13817 for 67 dth effective 6/1/2000- 3/31/2003 from k# 5A2529, transport to Leidy  #13824 GSSTE, effective 6/1/2000 - 3/31/2006, Demand Vol = 132, Capacity Vol= 14661.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Chris 713-853-4743 
 I didn't even know about deal 219618.  I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading. 
 Done. 
 Whoo hooo!  I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.  This affects our demand charges on CGAS. 
 We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.  Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know. 
 I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this ticket), 268090, and 268093.  Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August.  I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year. 
 Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their customers to another company. 
 Hi.  I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday.  Should I let someone in your office know about that? 
 John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.  I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price adjusted for dth??  I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563.  I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?  Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals.  Let me know if anyone has any questions.  Thanks cg 3-4743

Open for bids until 2:00pm on 4/26/2000  2174 of 2-3.  this is on k#.7537 
 its a good thing i a good looking stud! 
 I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000. My mistake. 
 Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left someone out.  This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.  East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing  CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should know the actual volume in the next day or so.  Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.  National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.  Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.  CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG. 
 I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara. Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000.  Deals 165415 and 165423. 
 I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 3/31/2000. The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.  Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow.  Thanks. cg 
 In today's Gas Daily, Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad - you probably aren't doing your job! 
 Just be nice to me when you become my BOSS, Boss :o) 
 I thought the meter numbers were different. 
 Suzie's working on your ICTS, it ain't working so far. 
 Probably. 
 Chris, Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42.  Can you provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq. 
 Hi! 
 I killed deal 233231.  The contract number was incorrect. 
 There are five CNG postings listed below.  Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H.

 May cash $4.00  June Numbers Nymx   $3.78 CNG Basis Bid  $.215 CNG Index Prem (.0075)  Net   $3.9875  actually losing $.01 or so before we figure the fuel of 1.95%  Fuel Cost at $4.00 = $4.00/(1-.0195) - $4.00 = $.08  Now its $.09 in the hole (.01+.08) 
 As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.  We still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our "approved" max monthly injection amount.  In Sitara, I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in the month of August. 
 One free soda for you upon request and providing I have $.50 in my pocket.

 Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June? 
 We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day)  through July.  Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.  Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens.  ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES. 
 Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice?? 
 Hey you said I could delete this one.  Yea!! 
 I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything.  I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow. 
 Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right? 
 Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month.  EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde is going to check around. 
 Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted. 
 I'm always willing to drive for a free lunch. 
 Did Cove Point approve that? 
 I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry.  Don, do you have a fax number I could send it too? 
 New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine.  There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.  This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically forget the "work".  If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever. 
 As usual, you are awesome!  Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you get them.  Thanks

 I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.  We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000  That's all for now.

 I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424. 
 Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.  The daily volume is 9189, the deal number is 227196.  I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month.    Thanks 
 We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.  This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale. Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us. Term:  11/1/1999 - 10/31/2000 Type:  EFP Differential: $.235 Point:  Tco Pool Trans Date: 5/6/1999  Sitara Deals:  158716/227890   the price in sitara is Tco Index.  Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me.  I will gladly give this to David.  Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara. Thanks. 
 There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 310,000  for Dec 310,000 for Jan 280,000 for Feb  Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?  Thanks chris 
 We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been addressed? 
 I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions.  Thanks 
 we will showing CES a bid today. 
 You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.  I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct. 
 FYI 
 Robert, would you put these deals on the morning sheet please.  Thanks.  We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more. 
 Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions. This is how it will work,  Deal #  Comment 268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume should not change.   The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094.  This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.  Thanks 
 Oh be still my aching heart, filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff)  I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!! 
 I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems.  I will try again tonight.  It takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email. 
 Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's pricing.  TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.  I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it. 
 I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth to 95246 dth.  Please make the following change: Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.  Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify which price is correct.  The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April and CES is showing $.175.  Please verify which price is correct. 
 Do you need a HUG??    :o)

 That little project has been killed.  I don't think Father needs another animal to take care of. 
 I send it to your work address tonight buddy.   You de Man. 
 I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport split out by East and Marketeast. 
 Just imagine a big smiley face with a tongue sticking out right here   ====> 
 FYI - PSE&G has 72,450 dt of primary capacity from Tenn Rivervale to PSE&G on Transco.

 I have a new toy! 
 Deal 125925 has been replaced with deal 231766 and deal 125928 has been replaced with deal 234584.  Angie is all over this one. 
 Sorry about that.  Gotta go to a meeting.  Give Muffy a hug for me. 
 Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet? 
 I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI   May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 3218, 3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 3213 for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames. We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H.

 Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.  I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;  Meter 4743 4747 4741 4754 4771 4753 4794 4728 4700 4749 4751 9740 6335 6333 4794 4700 4850 ISRP84 FSRP3 2SRP9   Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions. 
 Steve, I don't think you need to be at our meeting.  We have room 3125B at 1:30 PM tomorrow. 
 Kim, I need a room from 1:30pm to 2:30pm tomorrow.  Thanks 
 Hi gang.  I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal.  Around 1:30PM?  Let me know.  thanks 
 I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.  All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy. 
 Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks 
 I love my sweats.  Hows muffy? 
 Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers?  I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still.   Thanks. 
 I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.  There is no rush on setting these contracts up for Unify. 
 I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket?  Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on? 
 I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 (k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May.  Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May. 
 Hey, regarding deals 226462 and 258420, should we take the volumes to 0 on deal 226462? 
 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe that has already been done)? 
 I took the volumes to 0 on the following deals  Deal 257285 CES Exchange Buy and deal 257287 CES sale - term 4/1/2000 - 10/31/2000   Deal 257288  CES buy and deal 257289 CES Exchange sale - term 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  Thanks 
 I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power.  Jim, Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with Ogy unless she is out.  But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes I make.  I humbly accept my position. 
 Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound correct to you?  Please let me know. chris 
 Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 1,210,121.  I will try to monitor the deal volume.  Thanks. 
 Scott, when would you like to go over the CNG scoop? 
 We sold 870/day starting 5/2 - 5/31 to CES for Timet.  The deal number is 257878 and the price is $3.4884 ($3.39 + $.0984).

 I think Alicia fixed this last week.  Take a look and let me know. 
 It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not working.  Take a look at deal 98243.  I just had to extend the date for May 31, 2000. 
 Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 (in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle. E Town N Jersey PSE&G Con Ed Lilco Bug Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco) Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)  Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.  Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.  Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream of Lambertiville. 
 CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000.  thanks 
 FYI 
 Has this been addressed? 
 They are all in really bad shape.  May is looking pretty good though. 
 Do you know if this has been addressed?     Stephanie Sever   03/27/2000 04:51 PM 
 "Moths"  A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making.  The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.  Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you naked?" he asks.  Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here and get ready to recieve you."  "Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."  He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands.  "Who the fuck are you?" the man asks  "I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with."  The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"  The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.  "Those little bastards!" *

 Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.  The correct contract is 560104 (deal 254262).  I just killed deal 231301.  thanks 
 Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.  I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point.  thanks

 ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.  Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I believe its in the deal correctly.  Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or something real intelligent like that.  This deal goes thru 2/28/01. 
 She's outta town. 
 You are the GREATEST!!!  Thanks for the book.  I'm going to do something nice for you someday,. 
 Please change the following deals to evergreen. Deals 231754 and 231748.   thanks 
 This capacity is in ENA's name and we have been billing CES the demand charge since January.  The MDQ is 2300.  Thanks Joanie! 
 Do you guys know which contract this is? 
 Tetco k#892722, deal 207137 was terminated eff 4/1/2000.  FYI 
 Lizy, I don't know how you see these the next morning.  Please check deals 252056 (primary) and 252057, I just set these up in Sitara.  This is a Tetco contract I forgot to set up in Sitara.  Thanks. 
 Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like. 
 The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555.  I created the deal with 0 volumes. 
 Thanks for the reminder.  I just faxed a confirmation for Dick Jenkins, Direcotor, Enron North America. 
 I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is $3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.  Thanks 
 This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part.  Thanks Brenda. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to ENA - Im Market East.  This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 77563)  Thanks.  I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000. 
 We have our CES/Bug contract for May.  The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract number is 893255. 
 Sorry, I sent this to you by mistake. 
 Just making sure everyone reads their emails.  The term is 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2001. 
 Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.  That should give us 812 day injected for May.  This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.  I knew we could deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May. 
 Ms.  Arnold called looking for the IF today.  She gets a much better response out of me than you do. 
 We have a new Cove Point Storage deal, here are the details; Term: 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2000 MSQ 360,000 MDWQ 36,000 Demand $.65 Demand Charge for April  $117,000.00 Demand Charge for May - March    $234,000.00/month Contract  FPS1024  The CPR storage injection deal is 246517, the withdrawal ticket is 249409.  I entered all the withdrawal volumes to come out of storage the last 10 days of March,. 
 UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify this information and let us know.

 Responses: 1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.  2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we are buying back gas at GD - $.01.  3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill CES directly for this?  4.  See attached worksheets.  5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab. Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she will recreate Jan - Mar.  6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has discussed this with Melissa. 
 I don't know a thing, but I think Mr. Goodell is an expert. 
 All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.  Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch with Don and Ernie today.  We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some March) invoices. 
 Each month, Ed Glaum with CES in Herndon needs an invoice copy of the BUG release to CES.  Please send him the Feb and Mar activity.  His phone number is 703-561-6472, his fax number is 703-561-7317.  You and I may need to chat. 
 I added all of these demand charges as "Actual" expense items to the 2000ces03 worksheet.  k#892722 - You De Woman!!!  k#892069 - added to deal 143316 k#892066 - added to deal 143315 k#892084 - added to deal 143318 k#892085 - deal 143319 k#892590 - deal 245855 - added to CES worksheet. 
 You may not see this deal come through the normal process.  Please set up deal 245855.  Thanks   Brenda, this is for Tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me. 
 We don't have a time frame and I have told her we need to sell the cows and the tractor. 
 Hi gang.  Lunch with CES is on Wednesday, that day works better with Jeff. 
 Hey, thats Mr. Turd to you. 
 I love being a MAN!!!  Ain't life great? 
 Joanie found the email from CALP stating they did receive the wire payment. Robin called Roman and gave him the info.  thanks Joanie. 
 This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.  Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on.  Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give Mark a copy.  Thanks. 
 Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice.  Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 Sched Fee  $20,000.00  I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice. 
 Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.  AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that number. 
 Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.  I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What do you guys think? 
 According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?  thanks 
 I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM..  I though you might be asleep. 
 Seen this one? 
 Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets. According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4.  I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.  I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge. 
 Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com.  Thanks 
 What happens if we sell CES spot gas??  It would be fixed price.  Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals.  What do you think?? 
 I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.  I should have February to you by next week some time. 
 Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other.  Thanks 
 Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez?  Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban, he was impeached. 
 Hey gang, the room number has changed to 3084. 
 FYI 
 What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today? 
 The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.  This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals.  Which brings up the following issues; *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility. Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.  * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?  * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals  I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.  Thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 Could you get Terry authorization to path in Unify please?  Thanks 
 Hey gang.  Joanie is still working on current day activity.  Joanie, please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447.  I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day. 
 Please reserve a conference room for up to 7 people for 1 hour on Wednesday, April 12th around 2:30pm.  thanks 
 OK.  Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in Unify with a zero volume. 
 Don't I always get back to you within 10 min???? 
 uhhh - ok  <=== see no caps. 
 NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract. 
 Chewies on the way!!!! 
 Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though. 
 My worked.  How many times a week did you put down? 
 I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify.  The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS schedulers.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm.   Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.  Please let me know if you will be attending.  I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending. 
 Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes are on "Sheet 1". 
 I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb.  They have a little comment on their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet.  Give me a call once you get these.  cg 
 Hey Sparky!  FYI. 
 Hey gang.  Dan caught my mistake.  Tenn fuels change in April.    March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.17%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9327 
 Hey guys.   I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I found.  The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom. 
 This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.  Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.  2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.  Comments/questions? 
 I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd.  Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar.  thanks 
 Hey guys.  I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever addressed.  Comments? 
 Not bad.  Went to a John Zurita fish fry.  I rode to John's house with a power guy that lives in my complex and we stayed about 1 1/2 hours longer than I wanted to .  Live and learn.  Ankle is doing ok.  I wear an ankle brace and tennis shoes to work.  I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow.

 Here is the transport data for the Cook School Road   March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.28%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9294  Let me know what you come up with.  Thanks 
 Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.  I have a lunch meeting with CES and I will call you after lunch.  I do have the fax you sent.  What is you phone number? 
 I have my 1st therapy (physical not mental) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours.  Matt, why don't you go in my place, that sounds like it is going to hurt..  However, Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller cubes now.
