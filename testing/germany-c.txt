Bob Superty Kathy Kelly Ed Terry Tricia Bowen Judy Townsend Dan Junek Chris Germany Victor Lamadrid Molly Johnson Randy Gay George Smith Maria Garza Mark Friedman Ami Chokshi Scott Mills Dave Nommenson David Scott - with CES  Hopefully this will be a quick meeting. 
 Here 
 Why don't you guys try Pappa's Steakhouse?  It's about $20 - $30 a plate. 
 Sorry if this is a duplicate - I don't remember if I sent this to you. 
 What pipe is this off of or is it split up between several?? 
 Did you guys execute the PSNC contract?? And if so - as CES or CEM??  Also, I'd like to have the offer number.  I think Transco is done except for PSNC.  Transco Stuff I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES. I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM.  I think thats it. 
 I have all the CES and CEM capacity releases in Sitara  We have; several contracts for Atlanta Gas Light - all CES, we have 3 small Boston Gas deals on 1 contract in Z6 - all CES we have 1 z3 to Z6 deal from S. Jersey - on CEM  I still need to enter the PSNC capacity from St 85 to PSNC - real low on my priority list right now.  I sent Janet Edwards at CES a request to get ENA set up as agent for CEM - this has not been done yet.  Please show this email to the CES Transco scheduler for confirmation.  ta da  :) 
 Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278. Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.  Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.  Thanks 
 Tuesday 12/28/99 9:00am   Aspiration biopsy with specimen collection hematology.  Wed 12/29/99 7:00 am  CT scan without oral preparation 10:00am Bone scan dosage 12:00pm Bone scan examination  Thur 12/30/99  4:00 pm  appointment with Dr. Lee Jin Soo  There you go. 
 FYI - I believe this is important.  According to Morgan (CES's CNG scheduler) CES currently has about 7,000 dth of idle capacity.  I've had 3 people call me today looking for CNG capacity for Jan 2000. 
 According to Morgan at CES, the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR. Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon.  You may already know about this deal.  Morgan handles all the nominations at East Ohio.  Hunter, someone on the Central desk needs to talk to Morgan about this deal.  Thanks 
 How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was dedicated to retail?  From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small. 
 Setting these up in Sitara will be part of my night job.  I must have peace and quiet to focus on Transco. 
 This schedule just covers agencies with CES and CEM.  For most pipelines, It does not cover contracts where CES is acting as agent for another counterparty.  Call if you have questions. 
 Deja Vu!  I'm waiting for those Final Final Revised Final numbers!! 
 Attached is the master list of contracts.  I save this file as o:/common/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/hodge 12 23 1999.xls.  I know you have an abundance of time on your hands so feel free to browse this tiny little worksheet.  Call me if you have questions. 
 I don't think I have sent this to  you yet.  There are some ANR volumes down below. 
 I think that's enough stuff for now. 
 Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!  Sorry - that was just running thru my head.  I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.  Transport I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st, all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.  Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset management deals. Ex.  Tennessee MUNi's.  How many of these are there??  Good question.  Good Luck  Have fun ;) 
 I just spoke with John Hodge about Dayton's PEPL storage (see items in BLUE below).  According to John, CES was not able to utilize the PEPL storage volumes. Hunter, someone on your desk needs to speak with Marke Breese and John Hodge about the Dayton Storage. 
 Linda, Sylvia,  I need you to set up the Transco contracts as outlined below.

 I believe the EOG volumes listed below are ANR citygate deliveries.  Hunter, Dan and I will be entering all the physical retail volumes in Sitara for the East Desk.  Let me know who you want us to give this information to on the Central Desk. 
 Hey John, its a 30 min. trip for the email - go figure. 
 Where have you been??  Why havn't you called?? 
 I know you are going to make me a happy camper and let me know what you have executed for Jan 2000 so far!! 
 FYI 
 I have 2 storage questions for now.  1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking facility. The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?   2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current storage balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??       thanks 
 I have not looked at this file yet.  Please pass it on to whomever you think might need it. 
 I have updated the Tetco 7c usage tickets to include fuel. 
 Ernie's on the team now. 
 Very funny! 
 I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email. 
 I need your SS #'s for my beneficiary form.  Jerry, please forward to Don, I couldn't email him the other day. 
 Hey team, I know you guys are concerned about my welfare so I'm taking vacation.  I will be off on Tuesday Oct 17th and the week of Nov 13th-17th. 
 I took a 1/2 day of vacation yesterday, the 5th. 
 Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 11/1/99 - 4/30/01.  Is this considered retail or wholesale? I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.  Is that correct? 
 I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.  Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man? 
 U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just kicked in somehow. 
 She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.  I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck. 
 Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.  Comments, questions? 
 Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines? 
 The truth is out there! --  ------- Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day    Computer Gender  An English teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the English language; noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names, and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she." One of the students raised her hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"  The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups:  males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations.  The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.  2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.  3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem.  4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.  The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.  3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.  4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. 
 I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy  :) 
 Brad McKay sold 33,000 dt of the Iroq/Wadd to the firm Canadian book for May and I just sold 9189 of the NFUL Niagara to the Canadian book at a +.29 for May.  On NFUL - I created deal 749380. 
 According to somebody - housecats left outside kill over 1,000,000 tweety birds a day! 
 Hey there.  I was on vacation on the 9th.  I guess its ok to send out the invoice now. 
 I was going to call and harasses you but no one answered your phone.  I'm pretty sure my purpose on life is to make you miserable.  What do you think?  I will be out of the office this afternoon after 2:00 pm - Tenn shipper meeting. 
 Done

 I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this deal ticket.  Let me know if there are any problems.  This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New Power. 
 I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th.  This is a bookout.  The volumes on these deals should always match, if they don't then I goofed. 
 We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.  We will have to pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me.  The lawyer said we may have to buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose. 
 My fault.  Try it again.  I just released the deal. 
 I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to $1,194,758.  This is on deal 508891.  Would you please send out an adjustment for the decrease to New Power?  Thanks  My fault for not correcting it sooner. 
 You de MAN 
 Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270?  I am still estimating about $5,000 per month. 
 I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.  As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and liability) relationships.  Comments/questions?? 
 NEWS FLASH!!!!  The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem. 
 Do we still have any activity or imbalances on the following Columbia Energy Services contracts  k# 8G0a61 8g0a62 8g0a63 8g1064 8t0a61 8t0a62 8t1063 8t1064 
 Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of November.  The invoices are on their way, I think it would be easier to sort and review the data in excel.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.  VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.  Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time.  During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the capacity.  Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the capacity non-biddable.  I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me.   Dick suggested I tell you.  TAGG - you're it, I will await your command.  Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec. 
 Date correction, Dec 14, not Nov 14. 
 We a conference room big enough for 8 people on Thursday, Nov 14 at 3:00 PM.  Vickie, I will see if the meeting date can be changed if Dan calls. 
 Looks good with the following changes.  If you see these changes come through then its good to go.  Thanks   The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041, just corrected in Sitara. Added demand charge of $1,233,260 to deal 508891. Added demand charge of $647,256 to deal 380571. 
 Would you send me the purchases?  thanks 
 Did you say you were missing a phone?  I may have an extra one for sale - CHEAP TOO!  I made a bunch of 1-900 calls on it last night.  Newphew called me at 12:00 ish and showed up around 12:45.  I'm tuckered. 
 That means you didn't send me the attachment. OR if you did, I don't see it. 
 OPPS 
 TP #6562, North Carolina Nat Gas,  is a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. TP #6068 is the Trasnco interconnect with Col Gas at Dranesville.  This point is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. The meter number for Public Serv. NC is TP #6608, and this is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. 
 I need a Destin class.  The only think I know about Destin is that its a Transco Z4 Mainline Point. 
 I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.    I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 4/1/2001.  Pros Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing guru like myself. Will learn a great deal about transport pricing. May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con) Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk P&L.    Cons Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be. May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions. I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer. I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm very detail oriented. I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the job very serious. 
 I must have deleted the GRI memo I had.  Sorry about that. 
 I need to hold the New Power invoice until Monday.  It should be ready to send out Monday afternoon and everything should be captured in Sitara. 
 Have fun.  Gas prices are going through the roof 
 I will be updating deals 523459 and 523444.  This is a bookout.  I have these deals updated through the 5th 
 I just purchased 35000 day for Sat, Sun and Mon from New Power (deal 525128) at $8.40.  Bookout with deal 525121 (sale at IF + .0125). 
 Guess I won't need you tonight.  My woman and I are going to a movie. 
 Meredith wants a compact cd holder for her car for Christmas.

 Dick will be doing some deals with New Power that is seperate from the "Asset Management" deal.  Following are the spot deals Dick has done with Mike Garred  Deal  Vol  Price  Comment 516083  10000  8.00  sell to NP for the 5th at the pool 521475  20000  8.28  sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP. 510586  1435  7.20  buy from NP at WGL on the 1st 513896  1500  7.25  buy from NP at WGL on the 2nd-4th   These deals have no impact on the "asset management" deal with New Power. 
 Dick has this in at a $6.89, I assume you are ok with saving $2,250 on the $.005. 
 We have a new backhual contract from Transco.  Term  12/8/2000 - 12/31/2000 Demand $.07 k#  3.7714 Volume  5,000 Rec  Zone 6 Del  Zone 1   I just set this up in Sitara.  Please try to set up an activity number on this contract this afternoon.  Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 3, 2 to 3, or 3 to 3.  We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle. 
 What happened to all my emails?  How's my Duff?  What's going on? 
 You make it sound like you are going away for good.  I'll see you when you come back. 
 Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production? According to David Scott at New Power, they did not make any adjustments to the bill.  He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might have been some Michcon activity missing. 
 IT'S BIDWEEK.  I'M NOT GONNA SURVIVE.  I WUZ THINKING "RETIREMENT SOUNDS REAL GOOD!" 
 Early morning, right?  I want to be rested for the big party. 
 Hey Team!  This email is just an FYI for you guys.  I don't expect you to see anything until January. 
 Why did you go to power?  Are you going to look for some of the mistakes I made back in 1994?? 
 This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent.  Doyle is .8 miles off the Transco mainline.  What do you think?  I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to Transco.  It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St 65. 
 Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid ENA for October activity? 
 Hi.  I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday.  Should I let someone in your office know about that? 
 Probably.

 I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry.  Don, do you have a fax number I could send it too? 
 There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 310,000  for Dec 310,000 for Jan 280,000 for Feb  Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?  Thanks chris 
 I'm going to a Unitariean church on Sunday.  Not happy about it either. 
 Oh be still my aching heart, filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff)  I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!! 
 I'll be winning the lotto soon.  Nice knowin ya! 
 Sorry about that.  Gotta go to a meeting.  Give Muffy a hug for me. 
 I love my sweats.  Hows muffy? 
 I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power.  Jim, Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with Ogy unless she is out.  But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes I make.  I humbly accept my position. 
 Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 (in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle. E Town N Jersey PSE&G Con Ed Lilco Bug Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco) Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)  Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.  Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.  Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream of Lambertiville. 
 ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.  Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I believe its in the deal correctly.  Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or something real intelligent like that.  This deal goes thru 2/28/01. 
 The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555.  I created the deal with 0 volumes. 
 Ms.  Arnold called looking for the IF today.  She gets a much better response out of me than you do. 
 Did Tim and Dick ever chat about the FOM stuff??  What numbers should I be using now, FOM number, Volume sold back at Index Flat? 
 We don't have a time frame and I have told her we need to sell the cows and the tractor. 
 I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM..  I though you might be asleep. 
 What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today? 
 My worked.  How many times a week did you put down? 
 I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd.  Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar.  thanks 
 I'm having trouble getting off.  What time is the flight out on the 29th - that's my trouble day, the latter the better so I can be here in the morining. 
 According to Kimat this is flash to actual stuff now.  I made these adjustments today for Nov 30th.  Joann, Alvin, the deals listed below are bookouts. 
 We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002.  The deal number is 418282.  Could we put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet? We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool.  We need to call Bay State if we move it.   My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320.  I gave Stacey Angie's number as a contact.  If we can't get in touch with Stacey, then talk to Robin. 
 I won't be here tomorrow but I found an error on the New Power deals I entered yesterday.

 The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.  Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually flow into CNG.,    Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%. 
 We should have 4682 of Egan coming into TGT for the 1st and 4679 fo the 2nd -31st.  Would you guys check that please.  thanks cg 
 I'm going to Jay Blaine's taylor at 6:30 PM, maybe after. 
 I released 2,000 dth from CGAS contract 62164 to Ashland Inc. effective 12/1/2000 - 12/31/2000. 
 Who knows??? 
 You are the best.  I owe you a popcorn, small. 
 We are parking gas in Egan on the 30th (deal 508572) and taking it out rateably in January (deal 508582).  ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume parked.  These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals.  Currently, I show we are parking a total of 145,052 (to be taken out in December) and a whopping 48,025 (to be taken out in January).  Lia, please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you have questions.  Thanks 
 Jim's a wuss! 
 I set up the following new TU deals for May 1  759849	St 30 to Z6 New York 759876	St 45 to Z6 New York 759877	St 65 to Z6 New York 760097 Ragley to Z6 New York  759992 St 45 to St 65 
 Take a look at the "Spot Deals" tab in this worksheet and let me know if I'm missing anything.  My comments are on row 5.  Everything else on this sheet is a work in progress. 
 According to Mr. Goodell, Tetco has Teal Lodge on the seller's block.  I think you should buy it. 
 Robin called NYPA.  The transport contract has been amended and the only 2 receipt points on the contract are Mamou and Henry.  Bummer. 
 Guudyear 
 Judy said that because I'm so busy, you probably shouldn't bother me with this doyal stuff.  She wants to handle that.  I luv her!! 
 I'm busy washing my hair. 
 Could I get the following people added as contacts for The New Power Company  Tim Ray Jeffery Porter David Scott Mike Garred   You are wonderfull. 
 I might be able to get to it tomorrow if its a slow bid week, if not, then by Wed of next week. 
 CGLF I created deal 530445 (purchase from New Power at CGLF + $.06) to bookout with deal 380571.  CGAS I created deal 503451 (sale to New Power  at CGLF + $.06 + Variable from CGLF M/L to Leach).  Volume = 1,278 Deal 380492 is a sale to New Power, price = NX1 + .28, Volume = 2,683 day Please bookout the 2 sale deals with deal 503453 (purchase from New Power at CGAS IF + $.0125).  Volume = 3,961 day.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Chris 
 Dad has a subscription to Progressive Farmer, would you like me to have that sent to you? 
 I think the pricing should be Trco Index plus commodity plus fuel.  It looks like you just have Index plus commodity on the pricing. 
 I thought i heard Goodell refer to you as a "GOOBER"! 
 The date of this notice is the 20th, but if you look at the bottom (in bold) it shows this memo was posted today.     Media Inquiries: Chris Stockton (713) 215-2010 Other Inquiries: John McGrath 713-215-2514 November 20, 2000 
 FYI before I delete this email. 
 I think this is correct.  We will show it this way for now.  Can you verify what were billed in demand for Oct please.  No rush., 
 I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of. 
 Please add the following person.  Victoria Versen   happy Turkey day. 
 Would you get me all the contract details on this capacity and email it to me?  thanks 
 Man what a busy day.  I guess Ingrid is ok.  I have not spoke to her for awhile - since Peter Vint's wedding I think.  I'm mooching off my brother's in-law's for turkey day, then going to my Dad's place this weekend.  What are you doing? 
 I know you don't believe this but I am working on a notional offer. 
 I entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date.  I entered this as a Dec-00 deal.  The term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000.  My fault.  I corrected Sitara. 
 I missed this.  Looks like IT will not flow through St 90 
 I don't have any of the contract information.  I will have to get the info, get Marlene to set these up in global contracts and then set them up in unify.  It probably won't happen today.  I'll keep you posted. 
 I believe this works.  I'm entering all sales to New Power at Broad Run on deal 498019.  I created a purchase deal 498022 priced at FOM Index price.  We should bookout these two deals.  The delivery to the citygate should be on the big FOM deal ticket comingled with everything else. 
 Use Audrey as your contact now.  Her number is 713-853-4317. 
 I went home with every intention of coming back last nite!!  So what if I didn't! 
 We drinking beer tonight?  You called me to late yesterday. 
 I don't know if this meeting is still on.  I'll let you know. 
 https://www.columbianavigator.com/Ebb/Default.asp 
 Sorry Emily.  I usually just type "ALLW" to get Robert. 
 I deleted 2 meters from deal 418282 for 12/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  Please make sure the risk assignment is still ok.  Thanks 
 I can't remember, should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and Market East? 
 Hey buddy.  Please allocate the followin deals to 0 for the 9th only.  My mistake and I will owe you for life.  deal 720977, 720959, and 720986 
 I LOVE MY SWEATS!

 Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.  I spot checked some of the deals and they look good to me.  There are 2 small deals that are missing, deals 480324 and 480325.  These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX purchase.  I had the buy/sale on CGLF.  I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS until this afternoon.  Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next week.  The dollar impact should be very small.  Remember, I'm out next week. 
 Alfonso, you are off the hook. 
 Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October.  Jeff, we should probably chat about the pricing.  I'll explain it to you when I get back.  On TCO, I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price on the big citygate deal. 
 I just created deals 480324 and 480325 on CGAS for Oct 31st.  I missed these.  Please path them in Unify.  Thanks 
 Your camera takes good photo's.  We are going to the timeshare at Canyon Lake.  Remember, they had the pig and it sleep with Chad and Chance.  We are trailering the motorcycles up there and we are going to take day trips around that area from the time share.  We have the timeshare Mon-Thur or Fri.  Then we are going to Dad's for a night or two. 
 National Fuel Gas Supply is having a Customer Information and Procedures Meeting on Thursday, Dec 7th, at the Marriott West Loop by the Galleria.  The meeting starts at 9:00 am and will probably last to mid-afternoon.  I'm going.  I don't know if anyone else needs to go - Algonso maybe. 
 Thanks for the post card. 
 Hey, you're back.  Did you have fun?  jerry and I are taking a motorcycle trip next week. 
 What Chics will be there -  and you don't count. 
 I just updated the Egan Exchange tickets and my worksheet for Nov and Dec.  I think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault. 
 I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well. I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?  We don't have that much activity on this contract.  Let me know. 
 Nov 1st.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index pricing.  Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate sale to you, also at the FOM price.  Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and enter the deals.  Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power for the 10th-30th at $5.68.  I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to incorporate it into my citygate pricing. 
 Don't worry about getting me a Diet Coke.  I just got one. 
 My Tetco schedulers have not gotten back to me on whether we have shipped gas on these contracts.  I'll try to check that myself today. 
 Please transfer the storage balance of 420 dth from contract 530750 to VNG contract 300008.  Thanks 
 I know it, you know it, who's telling all the single women?? 
 Commodity and fuel should be 0 going back into Texas Gas.  thanks cg 
 Look again and let me know.  I had problems seeing the volumes at first, THEN I opend my eyes.  Makes a world of difference! 
 I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the following deals. Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.  Deal  Comment 473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections 473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.  Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan to Texas Gas ticket.  All of my information is on the following worksheet 0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested. 
 I did vote for the new sports arena.  AND, I'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today.  I will wait till after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input. 
 Use "Sheet 3" on the attached file.  Page me at 1-800-978-1788 if you have questions. 
 Have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts?   Deal  contract 456640  894232 456762  894233 459025  894199 459064  894244 459070  894245 459216  894199 
 Great, exactly what I needed. 
 Pager number 877-498-5497 Cell number   713-557-1572  I will be in Port Aranasas Friday morning.  I should be back in Houston by 2:00 PM and I will have my cell phone turned on for the trip home.  I don't have voicemail on my cell phone.  But, if anything should happen, you could leave me a voicemail at home and I will check it once every hour after 1:00 PM on Friday.

I will be coming back Friday with lots of fish!!!!!!!! 
 I can't see what you have in the 5th column.  Buy, if the all meters on the pipe are marked at TGT/ZSL then that tells me what I need to know. 
 Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following deal tickets  Deal  Comment 470563  New Power Exchange buy 470568  New Power Exchange sell 470582  CPR Storage Sell 470587  CPR Storage Buy  We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st. Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in Sitara.  Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions. 
 We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.  Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day. 
 I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.  please let me know when you validate these or what else you need.  Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.  Did this have a big p&l impact?  My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF. 
 I added the pipelines and zone/point combonations that I feel we will be using most on EOL.   Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I don't think I ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get this via capacity release.  I'm here for you - NOT.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  I entered the following deals at a zero commodity 470563  Buy exchange 470582  Sell Cpr Storage  470587 Buy CPR Storage 470568 Sell exchange   I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through March 31.  I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

 His new number is 713-345-6868 
 Let's chat about CNG retail storage on Monday 
 Have I told you how wonderful you are?  I actually the Gas Daily prices for every day.  If you could just enter them in Column S I would be so gratefull. 
 I fixed the volumes on deals 456638 and 456630 for the 31st.  Please take all other volumes on these deals to 0.  Thanks 
 I'll be gone but I will leave it on top of my desk.  The backpack is dark blue and is has "CRUX by Gregory" written on it.  There is a yellow cooler inside and 2 flashlights. 
 I brought in my backback, 2 flashlights, and a small cooler type thing.  They are sitting on top of my neighbor's desk.  Come take a look when you get a chance. 
 http://www.tax.co.harris.tx.us/ 
 Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS.  Dick and I will be chatting about this later today.  Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard about it. 
 We have a volumetric contract on Texas Gas and I'm not sure how to enter it in Sitara.  The volumetric demand charge is $.005, deal #461568 
 Uhhhh - You Bet.  Maybe they will send me home with cooked fish!! 
 I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you can use.  I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though. 
 Yes - a small one.  So maybe you should go camping with me - and I have fishing stuff too.  Where  are you going camping. 
 I need to look and see what I have.  But first, you are not going with some boys are you???  I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could put some goodies in to keep them dry.  Do you need fishing stuff? 
 I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle this for him.  Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES? 
 Just send cookies then and we will be happy. 
 I moved the volumes on deal 241639 from Transco Leidy to CNG Leidy. 
 You De Man! 
 I just entered the CES demand charges for August on the following deals  Deal 343896 - East demand charges of $655,443  Deal 231667 - Market East demand charges of $881,995  Thank you Melba 
 I created deal 461123 (purchase from New Power) and deal 461134 (sale to New Power).  I will price both deals using the FOM index pricing. 
 When do you take the bike to the shop?  I have your key on my keyring. 
 Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston. 
 Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.  Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.35 TCO Offer plus $.14  Good Luck 
 What are women really looking for in life? 
 What are the winning lotto numbers for Wed night? 
 What volumes do we have for Power Gas Marketing and for the sale to Clinton? AND what has Clinton agreed to pay us?  What is the deal number for the sale to Clinton? 
 Marlene, please call Beverly at 713-853-6357 when you get this contract set up.  Thanks 
 FLARE IT!! 
 Contract      MDQ 
 We sold the 1533 / day to Allegheny - deal 459226.  This is back on a month to month basis.  We don't know if we are selling them gas for Dec yet. 
 YES WE ARE!! 
 We should have some impact from the following deals 456630, 456638, and 414075. I increased the price on 414075. 
 Hey team.  I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the following FOM numbers  1st-6th  51,762 7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st 27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st  Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through the 25th.  Not as much as I thought. 
 Little correction going forward  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.27 TCO Offer plus $.19 
 Who's gonna pay for my popcorn?  Did you like that pumpkin? 
 Remember the Titans!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I entered deal 454356 in Sitara.  ENA inherited this deal from CES.  This is a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline.   I entered all the pricing and volume terms on the comments.  P.S.  Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra. 
 Scott Goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at AEP, and his number is 614-324-5038.  Scott is THE MAN! 
 Done deal 454150 
 28213  I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.  Est Citygate for Nov  43,213 Storage Withdrawal  15,000  Net Purchase from ENA  28,213   Does this look correct?  We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).  AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are maintaining.  Do you want to try and do away with any of them?  All I really need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone. 
 Sean may want to go to this. 
 The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power for the gas taken out of storage.  In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 11/1/2000.  Take a look - let me know if you have any comments. 
 Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.  Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on the worksheet.  So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.  Comments? 
 Deal 452810 is an ENA sale to New Power at IF + .0075 for 10,000 dth day starting on the 27th.  New Power is selling this gas to Aquilla. 
 We would have been around $.39 to $.42. 
 Steve Stonestreet said you have an email address for our team.  I would like to have that please.   I need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in November.  thanks 
 Jeff Westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe.  I attached September, is this the month you are looking for? 
 I checked the CGLF and CGAS capacity against Navigator.  Take a look and let me know what you think.  Also, do you know the demand charges for the CGAS items highlighted in purple? 
 Did everyone see this? 
 Kim, please forward to the traders.  I think the schedulers have this already.     Please forward:  Room Change 
 Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now. We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary (be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.  She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.  I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?  I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!  Later 
 Update, Scott and I are still looking at the storage numbers.  We hope to have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers. 
 CNG has new commodity rates effective 11/1/2000  New  Old $.0973  $.0462  Fuel remains unchanged at 2.28%. 
 Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.  The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.  Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.  Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.  Later Gator. 
 We both ran out of gas.  I just happened to be 20 ft from the gas station when I did it.  That was the first time we went by the skydive place. 
 Run facilitation by location reports for November 1st for  Columbia Energy Services ???(Inc I think)  and  The New Power Company  and   Enron Energy Services, Inc.  thanks 
 Call me buddy.  Ingrid wants to come over and do a dog and pony show about Transco's new ??system?? I think.  AND I suggested she meet with EES and ENA at the same time.  I'm thinking around the 1st week in November.  What do you think? 
 I need to check this one.  We have several contracts with evergreen clauses. I didn't think this one had an evergreen clause but maybe it did. 
 I changed the end term date on cglf k#50250 from 10/31/2000 to 7/31/2001. 
 I changed the end date on CGLF k#42789 (deal 156388) to 10/31/2001. 
 Correction on the 4,018 dth from CPA (offer #30496), the receipt point is Broad Run, not Leach. 
 Are you guys looking for people?  I have a call from an ex KN Energy lady looking for a job.  Name  Sharon Dale Beavers Phone 281-397-85285  Let me know. 
 I know, tell all the women you know. 
 I meant the top 4 contracts 
 You are correct.  The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one is released to ENA.  I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's contracts to ENA. 
 Opps.  You don't work for CES anymore. 
 Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I won't execute these until I hear from you.            The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff gave us the OK on this one. 
 CGAS storage looks good.  We are still working on the ohters.  I should have a better feel by tomorrow afternoon. 
 You're on! 
 Judy bought some new capacity on TRCO  Term  10/20/2000 - 10/31/2000 MDQ  20,000 Rec  St 62 Delivery St 65 k#  3.7145 
 No can do on lunch next week.  How about after work at that little Italian place (i think) close to St Thomas High School?  We talked about this place before 
 Come chat with me when you get a chance.  I see you are not at your desk, as usual. 
 Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ? 
 Please give my EOL id the ability to trade Canadian Gas products.  My ID is ADM81300.  Call me at 3-4743 if you have any questions. Thanks 
 Please send me the August invoice for CES.  Did we do any manual billings for August?  I need those too. 
 hey you, everything is still the same but here they are just as a double check  Zone Comm  Fuel 1-1 .0653  .35% 2-2 .0694  .46% 3-3 .0792  .45% 
 Give me a copy of the invoice.  thanks 
 I just called Lincoln Life - Dad's mutual fund.  He will mail me the forms to fill out today. 
 James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the contract:  MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000 The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and discounted demand of $6.08 If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61  What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 4723 day. What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61. 
 I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon.  Could you email me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August? 
 Let me know the deal # after you enter it in Sitara.  Thanks 
 Are you looking at the imbalance trade behind NIMO with Amerada Hess for April 2000? 
 I think everyone needs a good wife! 
 I didn't go to the shipper meeting.  We sent Sean Boyle, he's an ex CNG guy that works for us now.  You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back when.  He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group.  My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air.  No new news - I hope to find out more next week.  Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later!  Tell Muffy I said hi! 
 If I remember correctly, I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from someone else.  The delivery point on CNG was NIMO.  And this was the only time we ever used the agency on CNG. 
 ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.  I believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.  ENA released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and we wanted to transfer title at the pool.  I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning. He is terminating the agency. 
 Did you call me?  I have a message from Mike at 3-5480.  It ain't your voice on voicemail. 
 Cute, I want one!! 
 I will be out the week of the 13th. 
 Please forward to Don, my email is not going through. 
 I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via interoffice to Jeff.  There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.  How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal. 
 Victor, doesn't matter to me.  You pick - Mr. Goodell or someone else. 
 Jeff said he is still not seeing these 2 deals for September.  These are the deals I entered in Sitara yesterday for Sep.  Would you check on them and let me know what you find out? 
 I'm having a problem sending this to Don.  What is eamil? 
 I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better winter riding gear.  We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should only take about five minutes.  That's all I have for now. 
 Oh now you're teasing me!  I went riding last night.  I think I need some winter motorcycle gear.  My brother and I are taking a biking trip in November - don't know where we are going yet.  How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now? 
 We are missing 2 deals, 433359 (sale) and 433385 (purchase).  Please redraft and let me know if you see these. 
 Nuthin I want to put in writing. 
 I want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink.  Oh yea, you already did!    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different format. 
 Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September.  I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.  David and I discussed this.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, everything should be billed through the system. 
 Please redraft the New Power September activity.  I'm looking for the deals shown below AND there should be a demand charge of $892,040.00 on deal 377245 and a demand of $624,028.00 on deal 381811.  If you see the items above, please send me a new worksheet.  Thanks 
 Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000   Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment 47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes below 4,723 per day. Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.  21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below  21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below   Comments: If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  Questions for Tennessee; What are the rates for October? Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or monthly quantities? 
 I just entered the following 2 deals in Sitara for September, deals 433359 and 433385.  Please path these deals in Unify.  Thanks 
 Oh my, he's a big fella.  The quality looks great. 
 I'm scheduling it. 
 Call me, lets chat. 
 I have 17 days of vacation.  I'm rolling over 5 days which means I have 12 days left.  I think I can easily take off a week in November.  How about you? 
 http://houston.cowparade.net/ 
 We bought back some of New Powers first of the month volumes on deal 431846. Please match this deal with 431849.  I did this deal on the 5th and its effective the 7th - 31st. 
 Yes I wuz! 
 I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together somehow.  I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get in their groups and talk.  Let me know what you guys think.  I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob Supperty about this,. 
 We need to confirm all the data on Mark's worksheet.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify. 
 Who handles the billing for Ashland Chemical? 
 Hey Don, I'm still working on this.  I should have an idea by this Wed. 
 Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to BUG if this happens. 
 Adams Automotive at 713-932-0934. They are located at 1010 Blalock, across from the Fiesta, off I-10.  They may be a little pricey, but you can trust them.They only to do what is needed, and their service is excellent!!!  I'm glad you like the sweatpan
