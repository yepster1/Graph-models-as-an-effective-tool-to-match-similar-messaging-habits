erconnected with other points to be a division.  I know we treat single points as divisions in certain other contracts, but I believe these were set up prior to 11/2/92 and are "grandfathered". I also don't believe we are obligated - or able - to extend Sec. 11 rights to new points.  Frazier, what's your reading of this? 
 He can net imbalances together by "booking out" the imbalance of one entity with the imbalance of the other entity.  In other words,  do a book-out with himself.  This can be done without adding the single point as a division to an existing divisional contract. 
 Rob - What format should this be in? 
 A backhaul capacity lease was proposed in the multi-party Mobile Bay projects and FERC did not seem to have any philosophical problems with the concept.  I will defer the second question to the real lawyers. 
 I cannot see a Time Approval on the screen I get when I log on.  I thought I had approved all time reports for Jeanette Doll.  Please advise. 
 We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!  EPLF -- you're TOAST!!!!!

 Are these codes still ok?  If so, please respond to Liz Legros.  I will respond re end date. 
 Jeanette is still on assignment and will remain so indefinitely.  Debbie Thompson will respond regarding the coding.  -  Teb 
 Our plans are to continue to use Jeanette as long as we are authorized to do so.  We recently sent a justification for keeping her indefinitely, but, as yet, have not heard anything back.  I can not give an end date because I have no plans to end the arrangement.  If we are forced to terminate this arrangement with Jeanette, we would have to add at least 1 full time position and the quality of our service would suffer greatly.  Please advise Rob Kilmer and myself of the steps we need to take to continue to use Jeanette indefinitely.  Her assignment is not related to a specific project but is to provide ongoing regulatory support to the Transwestern pipeline. 
 To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately,= SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring al= l such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral = damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror fo= rever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence th= e following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours= after the preceeding sanction): 1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended 2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens 3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations 4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms 5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificat= es will be issued for humanitarian reasons)  If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove= all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Ja= va.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SA= DIST. =20 
 Amen! 
 Amy & Julie - I have sold my house and will be moving to an apt. near Kirby & W. Alabama before the end of the month.  I  am in the process of packing up my house and have several other obligations this weekend so I will not be able to arrange for the newsletter distribution.  I believe I gave Amy a list of the distributors - Deanna will not be able to continue and Martha and Pat have indicated they would like some relief also.  On the positive side, Lorraine(?) in the 300 block of Welch (with the new baby) has said she would like to help.  I can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor?  Thanks,  Teb 
 No regulatory problems.
