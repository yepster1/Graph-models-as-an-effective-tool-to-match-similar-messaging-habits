s rates.  I'm still not sure the tax component should be eliminated - Hope to understand more after Monday's meeting with tax. 
 It looks like we decide on a case by case basis whether to process pre-4/97 ppas. 
 Great! Now get off your Blackberry and get back to having fun! 
 Either other day is ok. 
 Did you make an appointment? 
 Let me know how it goes. 
 We thought he worked for us. 
 Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting. 
 Keep up the good (healthy) work. 
 Haven't heard anything from Shelley.  I think she had business plan meetings this pm. I will reschedule when I hear from her. 
 We need to discuss. 
 Please send me a copy of the 9/20 memo.  Thanks,  Teb 
 I have the same recollection as to the reason for the decision.  It is my understanding that the only items being amended are receipt point entitlements and that the shippers knew these amendments would be required.  Also,  I don't know whether all of the Red Rock contracts require the receipt point amendments or only some of the agreements.  My  thoughts would be to amend as little as necessary.  -  Teb 
 At a meeting held 2-3 weeks ago, it was decided that the P&C Agreements modified the terms of the base contracts and that separate rate amendments were not required.  I believe this was the consensus of the attendees in both Omaha and Houston.  Steve, Greg and others attended via videoconference in Omaha. 
 We must be able at all times to fulfill our firm obligations through Station 6.  We do not have the option of reducing our certificated capacity without filing an abandonment at the FERC in which we would have to demonstrate that the abandonment would not impair our abilities to meet our firm obligations. 
 I am not good at filing out forms online but please add my name to those supporting Alice for the Chairman's Award. 
 Thanks!  I haven't seen this yet.  -  Teb
