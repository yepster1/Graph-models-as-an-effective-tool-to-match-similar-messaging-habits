 What is the latest on the EOL feeds.  I talked to Dave last week and he indicated it was no problem.  I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let me know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late nominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers changing their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated. Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.  Thanks Hunter

 I would like for Colin and David to create security that gives access to the site for certain users only.  There are too many people logging in that we do not know.  We need to begin creating this list.  All Central, Texas, East, West, NYMEX desk and Chicago office traders (Richard Tomaski will provide the Chicago office names) Power traders Fundamentals Gas, Power, EIM Fred's group Lavo, Whalley, Kitchen, Frevert,  If you can think of any more let me know.  Can we implement the security this week? 
 I will be in the office all week.  Let me know when you guys would like to stop by  hunter 
 Hunter Shively - I have weather access and I would like to trade power  The remainder of the desk trades gas only 
 Unfortunately I am in Chicago on Thursday and Friday.  Hunter 
 These dates are good.  It would be best if they arrived between 8:30 and 10:30.  hunter

 Are we going to discuss these with Lavo before he makes a decision?  Hunter 
 Lisa and Jason should not be on our RC 
 yes 
 John  The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially different from the Thursday index.  We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.  I will discuss this with you tomorrow.
