ght I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may help you prepare for Thursday.  Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load.  Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand.  Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking.  Very simplistic, but maybe it helps. Hunter 
 how did this go? 
 I don't remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on Saturday morning.  Thank You Hunter 
 Has the deal between you and Patrice been booked? 
 I will talk to her as well 
 looks good.  I can not think of anything to add. 
 I am sad to see you go.  Stop by if you have time.  Hunter 
 can you attend this? 
 Chris, can you attend this? 
 great 
 The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a basis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages this product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be selected for index calculation.  Hunter 
 has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would work like this:  Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable injection    .015 bid     .025 offer  I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.  call me 
 thanks 
 EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is EOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an increase in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need more info.  Hunter

 where did you get your copy of Green Markets? Hunter 
 The first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for parks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me know what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the deals? 
 Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?  Hunter 
 I think I have a meeting that starts at 4:00.  Please let them know that I can attend from 3:30-4:00. 
 Should we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust in the numbers. 
 The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three decimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make the basis column more straight? 
 I don't know if you read your email so I am forwarding this to you. 
 Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?  Thanks Hunter
