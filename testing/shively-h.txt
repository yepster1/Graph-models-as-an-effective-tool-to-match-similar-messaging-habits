  can we get this on the website? 
  Reminder: PIRA Nat Gas update presentation Monday at 6:30 a.m. in 32C2 
 sure.  Give me a call on the day that is best for you. 
  The following companies have stated that they will not execute trades with Enron.  Some of these decisions appear to be regional or product specific.  For example Aquila executed a trade in the Central region but will not trade with Sandra.  East - AEP Sempra Mirant J Aaron TXU Aquila BP Amoco  Price - Dynegy Bank of Montreal Vitol Phibro J Aaron  Options - Williams AEP BP Amoco Vitol Hess (will sell options only)  Central - Mirant Enbridge Vector P/L Transcanada Sempra BP Canada Coral Canada PG&E Trading Canada  West - Burlington Salt River Project Socal Gas Dynegy Phibro TXU Coral Engage WESCO Entergy-Koch J Aaron (They are clicking to close out positions only) Mirant (close out positions only)  Physical Trading  East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap  Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.  West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.  AEP was noticeably absent from all regions. 
 does this plan satisfy our needs? 
 gas is ok 
 let me know when you get back 
 The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.  Chris believes that he can create an accurate production forecast model by basin and county.  This would give us an edge in the overall and basis market. 
  I thought I approved this. 
 If we have a full schedule.  I will take him to lunch. 
 Interview schedule:  Do Greg and Louise want to interview? John Lavorato Hunter Shively Dave Ryan Jay Reitmeyer Phillip Allen

 Can someone do a study on the tariffs of major pipeline storage fields to determine which fields require that storage gas is withdrawn regardless of price.  If not, how much to roll storage? 
 agreed 
  did you grab Bennett's internet favorites? 
 Grigsby would like to make an offer to Bob Badeer.  If you are ok with extending him an offer I think we should offer the same terms as his Portland deal.  Do you remember what we offered?

 Have you spoken to Andy's book accountant? 
  Rain,  please send to group 
  Rain  Please forward Chris Meyer expense reports to Laura 
 Thanks for the update 
 I liked him.  He has experience with some of the physical issues that we are trying to correct.  I think he would be a good liaison between commercial and IT.  Hunter 
  Please forward to the traders and place on my calendar 
 looks good 
 If this is HPL related, it is Tom Martin 
  A number of conference participants argued that, even under the new standards of Order No. 637, many pipelines still do not offer usable (manipulatable) data over their internet sites.  What specifically are the above participants arguing? 
 What instant messaging are you using?  I am disappointed that Deirdre has left.  Liz is in the VAR group and needs to be here early.  Hunter 
  will most likely reside on the east desk 
 Lisa kinsey, Bob Superty 
  Please make this change  Thank You Hunter 
  Chris,  what are our needs? 
 Fundies:  Due to rotations we need six analysts in Aug/Sept.  Chris has been assigned three new analysts from the pool.  I believe these people are outside of the 26 assigned to you.  We need a minimum of three.  If you want to give us up to six, we will send our allocation of three back to the pool.  We would also like a summer analyst. 
   Rain please forward to group 
 Sunday e-mail  hunter-jessica@houston.rr.com

 Friday may be best.  I need to check with the wife.  Hunter
