ad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?  Hope all is well  Andy

 I think this guy would be a good fit for RAC. Send the resume to them. 
 FYI

In addition he will be pursuing the channel partner opportunities with them regarding Product and Environment hosting services. On the sales channnel effort he will work closely with Dave Forster.

Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.  1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%  2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%  3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%  4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap  5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap  6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap  7). Same for Nov02/Mar03  8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02  9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap  10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle  If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.  Any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Andy 
 Claudio,  I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?  Thanks Andy 
 jeff said he does not have access to trade emissions allowances. if he indeed does not, please turn him on for those. if he does, let me know. thanks. 
 I understand; however my request stands. I would like a heads up whenever you are planning a trip like this, it is the same I ask of all my direct reports.  Thanks 
 John, On the first note: OK, thanks.  On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills. You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.  Thanks, AZ 
 I realize that traveling to see a client is part of our job. I would just ask that we try to spend those expense dollars as efficiently and conscientiously as possible.  Thanks, AZ
