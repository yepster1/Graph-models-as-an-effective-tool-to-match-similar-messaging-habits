  Small issue but annoying:  If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit "set" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.  Hope all is well otherwise,  Andy

 Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as "shaken but all right" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome. "Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now," said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour. "And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria." Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

 Dave,  Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know.  Regards, Andy

 In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. ``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''

 GLENDALE, CA- Rock guitarist Steve Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday. "His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked," said Jimmy Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry. "He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow." The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani "showed off a few licks" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah.

 Thanks, I think I am okay, but let's talk tonight. 
   Enron does not place NYMEX position limits on its desks instead using overall VAR limits. If a desk is authorized to trade a particular instrument, such as a NYMEX contract or swap, the size of that position is governed by the VAR it generates.

 I'm sorry, I did not get it. Thnigs have taken an interesting turn here, give me a call. 
 yes. 
 Eddie,  Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.  Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family, your friend Andy 
  I received this, this morning. I know you are busy right now with other things but I would really like this thing to stop. 
  Dave, This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.  Andy Zipper 
 Dave,  I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.  Andy 
 I don't know if Bob hillier talked to you yet, but I need Stack and Option manager set up on a stand alone machine. I am moving to the power options group as of tomorrow.  My cell is 713 419 0203. Call with questions. 
 Work for me. 
   --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 i'm considering this terminated. 
 I would be happy to, and yes you may use my name. 
 Rick,  I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it.  For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:  Average tenor: 5 months  Average trades per day: 400  average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu  average px: $2.7/mmbtu  With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7  You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.  That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).  The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.  As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?  Andy 
 I think I have to take my son to the doctor @ noon. Any way we can do Tuesday ?

 Can you believe it ? cat sleeping with dogs.... 
 Greg,  I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:  1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)  2). I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.  I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.  Good luck, Andy 
 There is a lot of confused bullshit floating around..... 
 Mooney's are great planes and are very fast. I almost bought an MSE a few years ago, which subsequently was called the Allegro, then the Eagle. They are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever. Drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward. They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy. Idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing.  AZ

 I think the note I sent to Steve plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough. We will not support the app. It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information. As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than "gee, wouldn't this be cool" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project. I'm going to ask Dave Forster to do that.  Comments ?  AZ

  Please call Joe Robertson of enron Metals in NY to discuss market-making deal with the COMEX. 
  this is the underlying deal. it needs work and i am not sure we would do it. also, no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals. 
 I AGREE WITH KAL. 
 I believe the attached note accurately summarizes our position. We do not see anything changing. The deal remains terminated for the reasons below. 
 I declined to review Drew because I feel I haven't really spent a lot of time with him. The times I have worked with him, he has done a great job and been easy to work with. 
 Let me make this clear: Accenture is not to speak to anyone other than ourselves regarding what they are doing with EnronOnline. We ahve too much at stake right now.  Thanks AZ 
 Who and why ? 
 Yes, and I would you and I to chime in as well. 
 Vin,  Glad we could hook up yesterday.  The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.  Thanks, Andy Zipper Vice President Enron Corp. 
  Please review the spreadsheet, and look at Daily Deals Graph. 
 Justin, The traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.  Thanks, Andy 
 Lara, You need to be the master user for the platform. It is EWS policy. Go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with Justin. 
 Guys, Let's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.  I'm good from 11:00 to 1:00  Andy 
 thanks. damned things never work.

 OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile. 
 Frank,  Thank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.  Andy Zipper 
 I've seen it before. It is Hong Kong Airport and the guy kicked out the crab at the last possible second. He was seconds from riping the gear off. 
 Mike,  That's fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline's concurrence. If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go. Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.  Thanks, Andy Zipper 
 We will do on Monday morning, but I don't think we need Jay involved. 
  Kal will be finishing mine shortly. Please be prepared to do the 3 hole punch thing 20 times. Thanks. 
 Okay, fair enough. He would be perfect for the role, but I understand what you are trying to accomplish. 
 what about London ? 
 It's fine with me. 
 CAN YOU SEND David Lebow in IR a copy of the above report on electronic commmodity trading. thanks. 
 Let me if you receive this email. 
 good ! 
 I'll attend briefly, but you can run it. 
 So do you think things are proceeding well ? 
 My guys tell me we are just about finished on our end and will be getting ready to beta test. How are your folks doing ?
