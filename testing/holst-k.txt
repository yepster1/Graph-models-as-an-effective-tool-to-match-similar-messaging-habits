 my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.  My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have three responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; and (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year.  Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.  John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.  Sincerely, Keith 
 FYI.  One sure way to piss me off beyond anything you could possibly imagine is critize me for something BEFORE checking the facts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I told your wife that I was gonna get the title company's number from you and set it up.  So go fuck yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
