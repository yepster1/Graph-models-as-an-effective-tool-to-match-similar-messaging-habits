ow because of inflated prices.  We addressed this issue several months ago by requesting that EES traders call our trading desk directly.  Assuming it was solved, I had not given it another thought.  Unfortunately, I have learned that this practice has been resurrected.  It is neither my place nor intention to tell you how to run your group, so I am requesting that you put an end to it on your side.  We are committed to providing liquidity at market prices to your desk.  Sincerely, Keith Holst 
 Mike Grigsby and I wish to recommend Scott Freeman for the October 29th trading track interviews.  Scott has accepted an analyst position with Enron and will be starting full-time in January, however, he worked as an intern this past summer with West-Power Trading in Portland and comes highly recommended.  Scott's phone number is 512-294-7692.  Please let me know if you anything else from us.  Thanks, Keith Holst 
 Tim,  We definitely appreciate any time that Steve is able to spare.  If you like, I will ask Mat coordinate his travel plans with Steve.  Also, if Steve made his rework documentation available, Mat would become familiar with it prior to his trip.  Keith 
 Vince,  We are searching for an individual to join the west gas trading desk on a temporary basis to lead the development of a comprehensive energy demand model.  Mike Roberts suggested that a member from your research team might be a good fit.  Our vision is to develop a consumption model for the western states (WSCC) which merges factors from natural gas and electricity markets.  This model would consider but may not be limited to: weather, electricity loads, a generation stack and commodity prices (hyrdo, coal, nuclear, oil, etc...), electricity transmission across regions, and predictable non-economic behavior patterns.  This individual would receive extensive exposure to our commercial environment and would have significant support from team members on our desk.  Two members of our team have started this project and I am very excited by the scope and depth that can be achieved with your help.  Please let me know if you are interested.  Sincerely, Keith Holst 
 Peter,  Enron's credit department is reviewing the proposed transactions.  We will have a response tonight.  Keith 713-853-7069
