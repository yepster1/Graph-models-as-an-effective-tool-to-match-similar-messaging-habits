m rig count data (or completion data if we buy the more expensive database) we can determine which "zone" a new well is targeting.  Forecasted production can then be determined by applying a recent historical success ratio and the corresponding depletion curve identified in the preceding step.  The difficult component to forecast with great accuracy is future drilling.  Our current thinking is a calculation that considers forward prices, drilling costs (which are increasing since all the "easy wells" have already been drilled), and common required rates of return.  Unresolved  Determining the specific plants which will be affected by depletions and new drilling is an unresolved issue.  The reciepient plant for new drilling may be identified in public records or we may be able to use rig coordinates to determine the closest and most likely plant.  Depletions may be more difficult as I am unsure if the well data can be readily cross-referenced with the correspon
