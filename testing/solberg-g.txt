 sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can. If you have any questions over the weekend call me.
