d I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.  I love you,  Cara 
 Hi Dearie,  How are you?  I have been hearing your name more lately, and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much I miss you!  I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.  Do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?  How is your husband?  How is your dog-bite scar? Do you have any new Jewelry?  I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.  If you do come to stay, please stay with me. I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful. 3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.  I miss you,  Cara Poo 
 You might want to check it  Are you still planning to come up and sign papers tomorrow?  I need to know because I had to go back to work early.  Please call my cell phone when you get logged off so we can get in sync with plans.  503/810-1105 
 Good Morning,  Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group. The users are now only me, Diane Cutsforth, and Donald Robinson.      I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation. Donald Robinson and Diane Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.  Donald tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.  His number is 503/464-3902  Thanks,  Cara 
 I spoke with Serena and told her how to roll scheduling forward.  Let me know if that doesn't do it.  CF 
 I was tickled to get such a cool card! Where did you find it?  I am thinking about taking the front off and putting it in a little frame.   I have decided to postpone the catchup Christmas party and instead have a housewarming party when I move into my NEW beautiful Condo that is right on a wetland/woods!  I go to sign papers today.  Thanks again,  Luv Luv  c 
 This might solve some of our login problems 
 I have a new cell phone of my own, when can I start expensing that bad boy? 
 Congratulations Steve!  How wonderful!  I love the name. 
 k, be there in a few

 I am at work for a few minutes and wanted to send you a quick note. I sure loved having you at my house, our talking, and I really loved this morning.  You are such a wonderful man. I am a very VERY lucky lady.  I love you and will see you tonight after my meeting.  C 
 I am here today for a few, what a rough ride that was.  If you have a few to stop by and say hi, that would be great.  :) 
 I am officially playing hooky from work tomorrow. 
 Good Morning E  Sure was fun!  Cara 
 yes 
 come over at your convenience and I will explain all 
 This is the most complete information, Bilat stuff only.  If you need any help interpreting the sheet, just pop on by   Cara 
 Good Morning,  Here is the preliminary stuff, direct bookouts and what is open.  Please call me at your convenience to talk about them.    Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling Supervisor Enron North America 503/464-3814 
 Good Morning..........sir,  I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me. My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.  I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  I told him no more of that stuff. On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.  :) 
 Any news?  I am just thinking I will leave around 1 pm here to go home for a bit. I don't have to be at this party till 7 ish, so if you wanna come hang out or just take a nap, you are welcome to do that.  ;) 
 They think it is a proxy server on my end and that if it is removed we should be fine.  Can you help me with this? 
 Hi Donald,  I got a smattering of information that the big E will probably go after us contract folks that attempt to defect.  So, I guess it's second jobs for both of us.  I am sorry I got you into this, buddy.  Cara 
 Hi Again,  Just let me know about Lord of the Rings, when I am done here I am going home to take a nap if we aren't going.  If Saturday or Sunday would be a better lazy day than Christmas eve, then we can do whatever. You are the only thing on my calendar after tonight, sir.   Call me at work, I would love to hear your voice.   :)
