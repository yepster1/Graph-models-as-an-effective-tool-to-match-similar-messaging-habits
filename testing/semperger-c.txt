little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.  I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.  I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.  I love you,  Cara "Pizza Pie"

 can you tell bob?  I got an undeliverable message from his e-mail address 
 she said she would get it for me after this conference call.  Are there going to be more Enron layoffs? 
 Let's meet tomorrow morning about 9 am to let me show you all of the tools that scheduling uses.  I expect it will take about 15 minutes.   Thanks,  Cara 
 Good Morning,  Due to our current situation, I have 3 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do.  They have a wide range of experience and abilities, and would be available to assist you in whatever tasks may need handling.  Please let me know if you have temporary room for any one or all 3 of these folks, I would like them to have something to do while we are waiting for trading to resume.  Thanks,  Cara 
 Hi,  Yesterday Richter asked me to get with John Oh and bring him up to speed on everything that we use.  Although I think this is a good idea, I think that this direction should more appropriately come from you.  Please let me know what you would like me to do, if it would be beneficial to have me explain our stuff to both John and Victor, I will be happy to do so.   Thanks,  C
