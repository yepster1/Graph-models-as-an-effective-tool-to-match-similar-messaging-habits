ames,  I just ran my build route for December and got new data blended with old data.   We need help immediately   Stacy's number is 503/464-3747 
 I need a reccomendation.  Please let me know when you have a few minutes of spare time. 
 I will be there with husband 
 Good Morning,  Diane is off today and tomorrow, just call ol' cara with questions 
 why is this coming from you? 
 None of us can get on the main site, and we are using their alternate site.  I had some difficulty making tags, but have finished. The problem I was having today is identical to my problem a few weeks ago where I could make the tag, but then everything would hang when I hit the 'confirm' button.  Cara Semperger 503/464-3814 
 I got your res and will keep it in case I hear of anything.  Take mine, and put it in your just in case folder.  Love,  C 
 I propose we just keep AOL 
 I plan to send them in a batch to you through interoffice mail on Feb 8th.  Please call me at 503/464-3814 if you have any questions   Thanks,  Cara Freeland 
 Please just have them create  me as Cara Freeland, new name.  :) 
 Other deals is fine,  Build route has been selecting the hourly deals just fine, and including them in the off peak sections. We must be able to see these deals, as we have a great many deals with odd hours and shaped schedules.  Thanks,  Cara 
 Auntie Cara,  How are you?  I am doing fine, I guess.  I think I am passing through the shock stage and may be entering the exceptance stage.  I am still so dazed from this whole thing.  I am supposed to go back to work on the 5th and may not be going back at all.  This whole thing is so heartbreaking.  I am attaching my resume just so you have it, if you think of anyone who should see it from you contacts please pass it on.  Take care and I will keep you posted.  Susan

 Things are much better now, we only have minor issues with control areas, and none so specific as to be addressed in a formal way.  Thanks,  Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling Supervisor Enron North America 503/464-3814

 I am looking damn good at 9 bux on the  pool   How horrible 
 Dynegy's presentation outlining what is important to them, some really good info here.  C 
 Understood.  I had populated the market path first 
 Good Afternoon,  I have attempted several times to make a test tag today, but the drop down lists for the PSE's in the Physical path area have not been populated.  I logged off and onto the system several times today to see if that would help. It didn't.  C 
 Good Morning,  LLH,  EES owes EPMI 18 MW   HLH  EPMI owes EES 2 mws  Diane will give you the MidC position if there is one, and Stacy will have the Palo Position.   C

 Good morning,  Please call me if this does not work for you,    Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling Supervisor Enron North America 503/464-3814 
 Hi Susan,  I am going to be in Spokane from Wednesday Night thru Sunday morning, I would really like to get together for coffee or something.  Are you going to be in town?  Cara 
    Good Morning,  Here is the bookout disposition that I have so far, along with my booking out options for the LLH contracts that we have open. Please give me a call when you are ready to go. I am only doing COB, Diane will be doing MidC  Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling Supervisor Enron North America 503/464-3814 
 Good Morning,  Here are the direct bookouts I have matched up along with my options I only show open COB contracts on the LLH   Give me a call when you are ready to go. 
 yes yes and yes.  The certificate stuff can be done at the end of the month when we know more about what is going on.  I have all the documents and download stuff to do that 
 I was able to create a tag, but when I confirmed, nothing happened.so I hit confirm a few more times, and got 5 copies of the same e tag 
 I would be personally interested in going to D3,  please try to plan it during mid month if possible. 
   Forgot the 4 mw path,  all good now.  Have a good weekend  C 
   Y'all have a good weekend!   Cara Semperger 503/464-3814 
 It is slower today than it was last night, I assume from traffic 
 Mike Tully is going to work on this with you today. 
 I turned my computer completely off and back on to see if my connection would improve, It didn't.  My plain old data only no macro excel sheet still takes 30 seconds to save.  :(  Outlook also seems slow, but I never liked it anyway. :)  C 
 Hi My Man,  Yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I went to see Dr. Soot today, she told me my pain is from the 2 big knots where they started and ended the incisions, and it will only hurt for ...oh....3 months or so.  She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me.  I can't wait to have some albacore sashimi and a little Craig on the sheetsheemi!  ;)  Love,  C 
 I am suprised at how little the bare bones employee and the full package employee trips differ in price!  I wanna do the 19 grand package. Employees and Spouses. Do for us but do the works.  I think it would be a welcome perk in a weary office right now.  C 
 Hi  Donald is having an access violation when he tries to run the Path Confirmation Report. Vish is aware of this, and wants to do some investigating tomorrow, but I don't know if Donald will have time.  Maybe you can do this with Vish and Donald's Passwords?  Stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally.   I am just ducky.  C 
 His attempts to get path confirmation he gets this error    ACCESS VIOLATION AT ADDRESS 005096E9 IN MODULE "PATH CONFIRM.EXE" READ OF ADDRESS 00000000.   He needs access asap.  Thanks,  Cara 
 The old build route remembered what the user chose last for delivery points, and had it in the defaults each time Build route was opened.  Can this be duplicated in the PSW version of build route?  C 
 Please have the default set to "Starting on" not  "Active on".   We use Starting on Every day, and Active on much more rarely.   Thanks,  Cara 
 MUCH INTEREST FROM ME 
 Hi Mom,  I am so glad that Nathan seems to be responding, his well being and future are what is most important. I don't know what to say to the behavior of Beth not taking responsibility for the financial end, and kind of holding you both hostage with this unspoken threat to withold your grandchildren.  I have so little respect for h
