to receive firm Consumer's CDA in exchange for firm Dawn. Enron will notify Enbridge by nomination deadlines the day before gas flow.  Enron will pay a demand charge on 10,000/day of  ________us$/mm.  Volumes is 0-10,000 mmbtu.  Term is March-November or April - October. We could also do it where it is January - December with Enbridge having the right to recall the service 10 or 20 days each year.  Let me knwo.  geof 
 What is the approved bidders list and how do we get on it? 
 I'll still pay IF Vent +0.05 for NBPL Transfer point. whatever volume. and yeah i'll meet him (i guess) 
 not possible 
 I want my harper gas! come on Tony!  I would rather pay 3 to  3.5cents for the vent harper transport, but if 4 cents is the closer i'd pay that for 2 years 
 can you email the three budgets , zws, cap, main i lost them 
 Please do not send out a confirm. I added notes to the tagg tickets. ECC is going to confirm and the deal involves an agency agreement. 
 Do i need to forget about this gas or is he still letting it breathe 
 NBPL Ventura transfer point, IF vent + 0.0125 bid. sure 
 NBPL Harper transfer point, IF Vent + 0.05 or IF NGPL MidCont + .185 bid  good to fill any volume 
 1 billion divided by 5,000 victims = 200,000. Why do i know that the storey family will get none. (not that she needs it) 
 thats fine. just call me before you go 
 I dont know what any of this stuff is and this is the first time I've seen any $$s.  I dont even see gas trading vision (maybe its the 'global trading vision'). Operational capacity, System Main, Fundamentals, Global Val, and Peoples all have other business sponsers. I cant image what 'IT Commer. Coord' is. 
 Niagara Dawn spread - Nov, Nov-Mar 
 yep 
 This is not what i wanted.  I wanted MTM value or Undiscounted cash per month, not necessarily per book. I.e. what will the books liquidate if prices dont move for Nov, Dec, Jan ect 
 give me a contact over there too BP
