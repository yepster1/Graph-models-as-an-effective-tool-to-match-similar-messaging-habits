 Randall,  I have a few structures to propose:  ENA sells to Bank of America             500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1 ENA buys from Williams                     500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1 Williams buys from Bank of America    500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1  or  ENA sells to Bank of America             250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1 ENA buys from Williams                     250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1 Williams buys from Bank of America    250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1  Either set of trades takes off $60million of exposure and flattens our total nymex swap positions. The latter fits the term structure of our positions better, but the former may fit our credit positions better.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks,  Geof Storey 713-853-7058 
 I have talked with them about phys rings. But the primary counterparty i was going to use was Dynegy. The trading wanted to make some money to do the deal, but i'm not sure where we stand with the other Dynegy stuff going on. So i'm on a holding pattern with Mirant unless you have any suggestions. geof

 clock's ticking 
 Are we doing ATM rings for Sempra and Kinder? Or others? Presto said he's refusing to do it in power for anybody. Any advice, cause the phone is ringing off the hook to do them.

  Larry,  Sorry I haven't contacted you in awhile with regard to the probate list of assets. We will be disclaiming various Life Insurance and JROS accounts. Harvey Cohen reffered a Trust lawyer to us by the name of Theresa Frierson (713-621-7007). We are going to have her do the legal work on the disclaiming and trust setup.  When the disclaiming process is done, she can coordinate with you the final list of probate assets so you can finish the court work.  Let me know if you have any questions.
