  Larry,  Sorry I haven't contacted you in awhile with regard to the probate list of assets. We will be disclaiming various Life Insurance and JROS accounts. Harvey Cohen reffered a Trust lawyer to us by the name of Theresa Frierson (713-621-7007). We are going to have her do the legal work on the disclaiming and trust setup.  When the disclaiming process is done, she can coordinate with you the final list of probate assets so you can finish the court work.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Geof  713-853-7058w 713-412-4632-c 713-942-7972h

 Here is my specs on the cash positions. Just look at the phy pos tab. 
 No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone.  While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type for basis options.

 All is well. Vicki left the hospital the first week in Feb. She's been in bed at home since. We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. So we may only have 5 weeks left !!!  We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller. I push the stroller around the house with a teddy bear in it, pretending to be a daddy.

  Those idiots. I was in a hurry and didn't want to miss my flight, so i walked out and assumed that they would just bill the credit card.  But before I left I gave the tux to the front desk and gave them your name and room number. The guy was like, "Okay" and then walked to the back room without writting your name or anything down. So i told him again what name and room number. He said "no problem".  Oh well. Sorry about the trouble and thanks for the invite. It was a great wedding.  Geof 
 Hey dork! What time does the flight arrive????? Cameron wants to see you!!!!!

  Sunday??? June 9th is Saturday. We'll meet you at the gate. Which day? 
 I guess theoritically there could be new info on rates and tarriffs between now and closing. But that seems very unlikely. 
 This is a bridging problem. We alsoi have bridging problems with Canadian deals. Can we talk about fixing these?? 
 Please add this to each confirm  1.  Buyer has the option to take gas at alternate Secondary Delivery Points upon proper notice to Seller prior to the pipeline nomination deadline for any Period of Delivery at no cost or expense to Seller. 
 Tommy,  I've been getting lots of email about IT budgets. My roll is to oversee the IT projects specifically for Gas Trading, particularly development projects.  I'm not sure your projects will directly affect gas trading and i dont know who to point you toward.  Sorry i cant help. Call me if you like  geof 
 th e attachment you sent wont open. can you send another. 
 Chris  I need a 10 and 5 year service out of Dec 2003.  Enron has the right to to receive firm Consumer's CDA in exchange for firm Dawn. Enron will notify Enbridge by nomination deadlines the day before gas flow.  Enron will pay a demand charge on 10,000/day of  ________us$/mm.  Volumes is 0-10,000 mmbtu.  Term is March-November or April - October. We could also do it where it is January - December with Enbridge having the right to recall the service 10 or 20 days each year.  Let me knwo.  geof 
 What is the approved bidders list and how do we get on it? 
 I'll still pay IF Vent +0.05 for NBPL Transfer point. whatever volume. and yeah i'll meet him (i guess) 
 not possible 
 I want my harper gas! come on Tony!  I would rather pay 3 to  3.5cents for the vent harper transport, but if 4 cents is the closer i'd pay that for 2 years 
 can you email the three budgets , zws, cap, main i lost them 
 Please do not send out a confirm. I added notes to the tagg tickets. ECC is going to confirm and the deal involves an agency agreement. 
 Do i need to forget about this gas or is he still letting it breathe 
 NBPL Ventura transfer point, IF vent + 0.0125 bid. sure 
 NBPL Harper transfer point, IF Vent + 0.05 or IF NGPL MidCont + .185 bid  good to fill any volume 
 1 billion divided by 5,000 victims = 200,000. Why do i know that the storey family will get none. (not that she needs it) 
 thats fine. just call me before you go 
 I dont know what any of this stuff is and this is the first time I've seen any $$s.  I dont even see gas trading vision (maybe its the 'global trading vision'). Operational capacity, System Main, Fundamentals, Global Val, and Peoples all have other business sponsers. I cant image what 'IT Commer. Coord' is. 
 Niagara Dawn spread - Nov, Nov-Mar 
 yep 
 This is not what i wanted.  I wanted MTM value or Undiscounted cash per month, not necessarily per book. I.e. what will the books liquidate if prices dont move for Nov, Dec, Jan ect 
 give me a contact over there too BP
