icity can move most effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power authorities. 
 Thanks 
 Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). Thanks. 
 One additional point I should have mentioned on last e-mail...While it was good to spend this visit exclusively in the office, I want to find additional ways to contribute to the group during my future stays in the London office. If there are meetings outside the office, with regulators or others, where I could be of value, please let me know. I will try to give as much advance notice as possible of future stays in Europe. I'm feeling my way through this new role  and will be looking to the four of you for guidance, both as to where I can contribute and where I can't. Thanks.
