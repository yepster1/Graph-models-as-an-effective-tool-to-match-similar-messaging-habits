results of the audit.  I'm not sure they were all that successful? 
 Kam,  Could you please grant me access to the O:\TDS directory so that I can load curves in Brad McKay's absence, as well as set my own in the future.  Thanks,  Jon 
 Ahhh....e-request, sorry for the inconvenience, I thought you were the gate keeper.  Thanks for all you help! 
 Adam,  The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank You.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.  If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.  Thanks,  Jon 
 Thanks for the invite, but it looks like I'm committed to going to the A&M ND game.  Jon  PS. love the in-depth feed back for my mid year review 
 I actually feel rested this morning.  Outlook for the day is positive.........I'll keep you informed.  Love Jon 
 Thanks,  I'll try it out! 
 Could you help me obtain access to the O:\ERMS directory?  I know I'm suppose to send an email to someone, but I'm not sure who.  Thank you,  Jon 
 Could you please send an e-request (to who ever gets them) for me so that I can access O:\TDS\TDS Curve\NY\  Thanks,  Jon

 How's about 5:30? 
 Adam,  So far so good!  I'm only concerned with being able to print it out on one page.  If you need more space turn the print page to landscape and use smaller font.  Keep making the font smaller until either we get everything on one page or until you can't read the printout.  Do you need me to do anything?  Jon 
 Today around 3:30? 
 Are we going today?  I went for a run out to Sheppard and back yesterday it adds about 12min. 
 your still done! 
 Sorry, for not saying good-bye when you left last night.  I thought you were at work on Thursday and I thought I would wish you well then.  So I guess, better late than never.  Have a good and safe trip!  Regards,  Jon 
 I have the squash racket in hand and I'm ready to play..........what time 5:30-6:00?  Love  Jon 
 Offers:  Nov02-Mar03, CNG Index, 5000/day @ .025 Nov03-Mar04, CNG Index, 5000/day @ .025 Apr02-Mar03, Z6 NY Index, 3000/day @ .14 Apr02-Mar03, M3 Index, 4000/day @ .045  I hope these help.  Regards,  Jon 
 Sorry Jim,  I don't really have much interest in selling the M3 and TZ6 index for those time periods (let alone any better than I quoted) and the CNG Index numbers came from Brad McKay where his two-way was .0175/.025 on both terms.  He is not in today and I am covering for him, and I will not be improving his offers in his absence.  Regards,  Jon 
 Well..............   On another note, due to the Friday effect running has been cancelled today.  If you want to go this weekend let me know. 
 How's about today at 2:00?  I looked at the map over the weekend and noticed a few areas that will need further work......overall not too bad!  Jon 
 How are you feeling today?...........I'm losing the war and thought I'd send you a note from the front......... Out look is ambiguous.  Love Jon 
 Or are we running. 
 What time do you want to run?  The earlier the better for me........bad day and I can't wait to get out of here. 
 Glen,  YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!   Glad to see you are still around.   What's with the new job?  For me the new job is obvious.  We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.  Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.  Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).  I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).  No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.  Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.  If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.  Anyways,  I'll keep you posted.  My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.  If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.com  How's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.  Jon 
 Any time after 1:30 is fine with me.  Regards,  Jon 
 You are a better man than me, yes, but I'm not so sure it will be outside. 
 Vladi,  I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.  Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.  I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.  I hope the vacation is going well.  Sorry to disturb you.  Regards,  Jon 
 Right back at you and I would be even more takin by you if you would pick up my race for the cure package. 
 Not silly, but working on unemployeed. 
 Thank You! 
 Happy Birthday to YOU Happy Birthday to YOU Happy Birthday dear Beth Happy Birthday to YOU!!!   HAPPY 33rd BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Heeelllloooo G Money,  Long time no e-mail!....  Things here are starting to settle down a little.  I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.  I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.  Last week end I went to the Houston Grand Prix.  Paul Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy Patrick?????) didn't do to well.  Although, Enron had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.  It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the "thick" of things.  The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.  A couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.  It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in.  There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.  I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about  as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.  Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.  The apartment is starting to get organized.  It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.  I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.  How are things with you?  Are you guys getting out much these days?  Anything new and exciting going on in your life?  I hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.  Have one for me!  Jon 
 I would love to be included.  Thank You. 
 Thank you very much for looking into this for me.  I look forward to hearing from you  Regards,  Jon 
 This should supply you with hours of endless entertainment.  It is fun to use as a tool to mock you associates.  Love Jon 
 Are you going to the hospital today or would you like to run? 
 Scott,  Here is the unwind structure for 7500/MMBtu of the Boston Gas deal.  Could you please set aside some time tomorrow to discuss the costs and residual risks that would be left after unwinding this deal.  I would like to include Gerry and Howard from our Calgary office in this discussion so they can brief you on the current status of Cal pine.  Below is a couple of slides that show the unwind.  Regards,  Jon 
 5:30 
 If so, what time? 
 Dale,  Thank you very much for hooking me up with Stephen.  It seems that he will probably be able to help me move some of my stuff directly to the US.  Could you please see that the address on my current accounts with RBC gets changed to my Houston location so I can receive statements going forward. The correct address is:
