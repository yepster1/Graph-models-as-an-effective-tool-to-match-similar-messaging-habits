 Helllllooooo Aunt,  I'm on my way to Houston tomorrow.  I've sold the China cabinets, but not the TV cabinet. (Still working on it!)  Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.  I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.  I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.   I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.   Love  Jon 
 please price 
  Sorry, I was out Friday.  How's about com'in out for a beer Tuesday with the whole gang?  If your uncomfortable with hangin' out with a bunch of Enron people then maybe we can catch a QUICK one tonight.  Cheers 
 The AGA number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that I didn't think we were going to see a long time.  But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.  I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.  Regards,  Jon 
 Empress can be traded in either, but for these purposed we would have it in USD/MMBtu.  Regards,  Jon

 Here is how Gator's treat there young.  Also, you are  correct, the API polls have Florida ranked one, Miami ranked two, and Florida State ranked 6.  Florida did not have the most vote for the number one place (Miami had more) but non the less are coming out of the gate in the number one spot.  Do you think the sports writers spent all their time in Florida, or what?  Crazy! 
 Don't worry with the 11GJ's just as long as we have the proper volumes over here.  Also, leap years are observed in the gas business.  When working out the number of days on excel, if you take the month in advance and subtract the current month it will give the correct number of days (including leap years).  Regards,  Jon
