 Hi Tim,  I got your e-mail and was pleasantly surprised to actually hear from you!  I hope the rest of your trip went well.  Some day I hope we can sharing a beer in the UK.  Cheers from Canada,  Jon

 Hi Rod,  I am forwarding this e-mail just to let you know what I am being told as far as selecting a realtor (see below).  Today I am going to talk to the relocation people and do what I can about keeping things going with you.  The relocation people don't sound like they know what is going on, as demonstrated by their reference to "favorable tax treatment", but if they insist on having Royal LePage I wanted to see if you could speak to them directly.  My preference is to have you represent me, but if they are "paying the bills" I may have little choice.  Best Regards,  Jon

 Mark,  Do you remember this agreement?  I think I told you to pass it along to the new lawyer when he came and I was wondering if this was done, and if I should follow up with him?  They certainly are persistent in getting us to sign this.  Please direct me as to what I should be doing   Regards,  Jon   PS. When you comin' back?

 this person does not report to me. 
 Jay,  The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.  Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.  As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.  The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.  Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?  Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.  Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.  Happy 4th of July,  Jon 
 I guess I'm not sure what you are after?  Do you have an example of another one that I could work off of ?  If I had a better idea of what kind of thing were suppose to be included I could probably get you something else.   Are we after more words or more duties.  Jon 
 Please note that because this event of force majeure is at the plant, and not on the pipe, it does not qualify as an event of force majeure under our contract.  Any deals we have that are not done under a Enron contract will probably have force majeure applied to them.  Please endeavor to find commercially reasonable terms to work around this problem regardless of who's contract the deal was done under.  Regards,  Jon 
 Yes, all trades have and associated contract that outlines the "performance obligations" and this is similar to NGX's.  Still waiting to talk to a lawyer on the other issues.  I will get it to you today.  Jon 
 Call me on this one.  I think AECO would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in Saskatchewan trades at AECO - X.  Therefore an AECO hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk.  Hope all is going well.  Jon
