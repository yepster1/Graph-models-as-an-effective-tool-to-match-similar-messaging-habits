 not new customers. I have all but given up on this issue.  In terms on of # of trades/day for Alberta Power, the numbers for Aug and Sep are low:  August is 24 trades/day not 22 trades/day Sep is 13 trades/day not 8 trades/day  I will check the gas info later 
 Can you spend time with your replacement before you leave? I'll let you know on Monday who that will be.  Good luck in your future endeavours, it is sad to see you go. 
 Where is my preliminary P&L for Oct 16? 
 I plan to attend 
  Looks ok to me from the trading side 
  I agree, I feel the same.  It feels like we are getting left behind. 
  Unfortunately, the timing does not work for me 
 I don't have the P&L summary with post ID's for my gas books as of 10/12 
  Also, where are my gas reports 
  Also, instead of sending me the P&L via e-mail, arrange to have someone here to put the P&L and new deal reports on my desk as usual.  Thanks 
 can you make it more official looking, ideally a fax, signed by you, no worries, there is no liability 
 The currency P&L is missing from the preliminary again.  We shouldn't post P&L to the executive management reports with missing components. 
 BTW, I think I have a bye on this video. 
 I am not sure what New Start is? Any details? 
 What is the asking price of this vehicle? 
  Hey Jim and Greg, Jessica and I sent a card to Chris's wife asking about his well-being and this is the unfornate response.   Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 3:04 PM Subject: From Anne Wodenshek Jessica and John, Thanks for the card, yes Chris was in the WTC, 105th floor on Tuesday  the 11th...2 days after our 12th wedding anniversary.  I hadn't spoken to  him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack.  I only  hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer. Some of the  other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they  said that they were going to be evacuated.  None of the 36 people who  worked for Chris got out, and in total, there were nearly 700 employees of  Cantor, Espeed and TradeSpark that didn't survive. We are all in a state  of shock and disbelief.  Chris would have turned 36 on 9-22.  He was  the most wonderful, hardworking, dedicated, easy going, kind, loving and  respectful person I have ever known.  He never had a bad word to say about  anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body.  The children and I, (5), feel  like our lives ended that same day.  I can't imagine moving on or ever  being h
