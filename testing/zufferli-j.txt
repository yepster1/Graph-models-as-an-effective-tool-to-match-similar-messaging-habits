nizan formal authority to be your direct supervisor.  Bill will be the point person for any questions, development issues and concerns that your group may have.  You are still welcome to approach me at any time.  However, I feel that given my increased responsibilities with the gas group, it would only be fair to the four of you, in terms of career development, to have more frequent and detailed interaction with Bill.  Thank you.  P.S. I would like to make this announcement in person but as you know it is difficult to get all four of you at the same time. 
 We can put him in sean's seat 
 Looking forward to it 
 Sure. 
 I'll be there 
 Things are ok.  How is the new family addition doing? 
 ok 
 I don't have any immediate needs.  I don't know if anyone would want to come work for Canadian Pesos anyway.  Sorry I couldn't be more help.  See you 
 No problem

  Just respond to Angela with how many seats you think you'll need. 
 Power Trading will need about 6 seats. 
 This sounds fine. 
 I sent a request to reactivate the PowerPool of Alberta's view access to EOL Alberta Gas and Alberta Power.  The request was sent to the help e-mail address 1 week ago.  To date the powerpool has not received access.  Can you inform me how long it will take?  Thank you. 
 Nella, the trade volume info looks correct.  It is the new counterparty info that is incorrect  in Q1 - we had 8 new counterparties for the Alberta Power product in Q2 - we had 2 new counterparties for the Alberta Power product 
 Have you got you Enron Online reactivated yet?

 Here is a copy of the script.  Let me know if you have any comments.  We can meet at my house at around 7:30 PM tonight.  133 Slopeview Drive phone:	685-4817  Can every dress up in as bushman or farmer outfit as you have.  It might be funny for Rob to wear a hockey jersey with the letter C on it.  Does anyone have a chalkboard?  Kyle can you bring you abacus? 
 This seems fine. 
 Sorry Nella, I replied a while ago directly to Rob Milnthorp 
 As a policy we only provide this info to customers who do business with us. 
 yes 
 No problem.  Just arrange it with Angela. 
 Can you re-activate the Alberta Power Pool Access to EnronOnline.  Although this entity doesn't trade, it is important that they have access to the Alberta Gas and Alberta Power product for view only.  This is a government entity that controls important gas generators in the province. They use our info about AECO gas in dispatching these units and they are an advocate for electricity trading in the province.  Therefore, they need to see the Alberta Power market data on EOL.  Thank You  John Zufferli 
 Looks right 
   I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney,  the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account 
 Do you have our flight info? 
 Call us from London when youget there 
 Jason can you make a power point slide with the following spreadsheet.  Just use the number of trades and volume of trade columns (i.e. the first two) 
  can you update slides 13-16 as of end of July 
 We should make reservations for:  John Lavorato Rob Milnthorp Derek Davies John Zufferli Eric LeDain John MacKay Chris Lambie John Disturnal Mike Cowan 
 I am sure that John Lavorato will want to see a presentation for the Alberta Power Fundamentals.  To save the hassle of develop powerpoint slides.  Is there a way that we can simply tie a projector to the computer and run it off of our website.  Additionally, can you enter the new known generation in the database. I am sure that he will want to see this as well.  He will be in the office on Wed afternoon. 
 these are all ok 
 The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows:  70 MW @ $0 50 MW @ $35.49  Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.  Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.  We analyzed the offer stack and it appears that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0  I called Doug Heath to discuss this.  He hasn't called me back.  The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK. I received a justified answer.  However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.  Can we pursue this.   Thanks  John

 one thing, we should wait before we dole out all 250 until we hear from others 
 I was talking to John Lavorato just this morning and he said that he e-mailed you a memo that described the topics that he wanted to talk about next week. Do you have a copy of that? 
 I am interested 
 Looks pretty cool.  I think we can use it 
 I recognize that Aug 17 is Jason Garvey's last day, I am fine with that date. 
  Karim , this is the deal that I was talking about this morning.  Albert is saying that it should have appeared in Friday's P&L.  Can you check this with him and let my know today.  When you said it was in tonights P&L, I think Albert was talking about the Telus deal not the Cisson deal. 
 It didn't, check with Karim and let me know today.  Thanks 
 Will the Telus and Cisson deal appear tonight?  Because I haven't seen the Cisson deal of +53K yet? 
 Not really, maybe 0.5 HR in Aug only, rest in unchanged 
  who at UBS should we talk to? 
 sure
