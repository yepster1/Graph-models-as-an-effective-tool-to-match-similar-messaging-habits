  can you update slides 13-16 as of end of July 
 We should make reservations for:  John Lavorato Rob Milnthorp Derek Davies John Zufferli Eric LeDain John MacKay Chris Lambie John Disturnal Mike Cowan 
 I am sure that John Lavorato will want to see a presentation for the Alberta Power Fundamentals.  To save the hassle of develop powerpoint slides.  Is there a way that we can simply tie a projector to the computer and run it off of our website.  Additionally, can you enter the new known generation in the database. I am sure that he will want to see this as well.  He will be in the office on Wed afternoon. 
 these are all ok 
 The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows:  70 MW @ $0 50 MW @ $35.49  Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.  Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.  We analyzed the offer stack and it appears that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0  I called Doug Heath to discuss this.  He hasn't called me back.  The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK. I received a justified answer.  However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.  Can we pursue this.   Thanks  John

 one thing, we should wait before we dole out all 250 until we hear from others 
 I was talking to John Lavorato just this morning and he said that he e-mailed you a memo that described the topics that he wanted to talk about next week. Do you have a copy of that? 
 I am interested 
 Looks pretty cool.  I think we can use it 
 I recognize that Aug 17 is Jason Garvey's last day, I am fine with that date. 
  Karim , this is the deal that I was talking about this morning.  Albert is saying that it should have appeared in Friday's P&L.  Can you check this with him and let my know today.  When you said it was in tonights P&L, I think Albert was talking about the Telus deal not the Cisson deal. 
 It didn't, check with Karim and let me know today.  Thanks 
 Will the Telus and Cisson deal appear tonight?  Because I haven't seen the Cisson deal of +53K yet? 
 Not really, maybe 0.5 HR in Aug only, rest in unchanged 
  who at UBS should we talk to? 
 sure

 Thanks for making the changes on the P&L and fixed price positions report.  Can you also change the natural gas basis position by trader report from MacKay to Lambie? 
  Does this resume interest you? 
 Congrats, Harvard is OK not as good as Chicago though. Just joking 
 Can you change John MacKay's name in the Natural Gas Fixed Price Positions by Trader, Natural Gas Basis Positions by Trader, Natural Gas P&L to Chris Lambie. John is being relocated to Houston and Chris Lambie is now in charge of the Alberta Gas Term Desk.  Additionally, can you merge the P&L under  MacKay and Add. Trading into one line item and call it Lambie. Therefore Lambie should be (41,480) as of yesterday's report. 
 I won't have it until tomorrow morning because of a deal entry error in my 2002 position 
 when? i am free anytime this aft 
 ok 
 Same price as other volume, start date is fine, e-mail me for confirm 
 Your numbers amount to a adjustment of (1,746,675), were the total 2nd order from Jun 29 was (1,891,851), now I understand that I would receive a some negative 2nd order to explain some of this difference I just thought that (145,176) difference (i.e. (1,891,851-1,746675) which should be the true 2nd order) was a bit high. 
 The total 2nd order up to and including July 16 is (1,891,851) 
 Karim, I don't want to wait till month end, let's adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order, lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts. 
 unable to attend at that time due to a prior appointment,  I can meet with you individually later some time 
 should be ok 
 Lets try before Fri, as I am planning to take that day off 
 NO 
 1 user of accumap  I'll look into the other issues, I just thought that you may know who may be handling it, we may just do it directly from Calgary 
  Offer price is $61.50 
 This is not just a July 6 issue.  Before June 29, my 2nd order effects have been less thatn 15000 CDN$.  For the following days, my 2nd order effects have been:  June 29		C$ (216,729) July 2		C$ (140,533) July 3		C$ (212,285) July 5		C$ (117,156) July 6		C$ (385,535) July 9		C$ (264,504)  What is going on?  Can you explain ? 
  Can you explain this in english to me??  This just talks about July 6, what about the days since June 29.  I hope that the curves for today came down ok. 
 John,  I lost the following on 2nd order in the options book (in Canadian $):  June 29: 	(216,759) July 2:		(140,533) July 3:		(212,285) July 5:		(117,156) July 6:		(385,535) July 9:		(264,504)  Total		(1,336,772)  Prior to June 29, the largest 2nd order was <15,000 
  I think you need to do this.  They want the info today for PRC reasons.

  according to the packet that was distributed in the meeting today with BC, it appears that Calpine, El Paso, Williams, AEC Marketing, AEC Storage are all FEB 1, this doesn't jive with what you just sent, wassup? 
 I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.  In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to 11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.  I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.  The trade for a 25 MW long Alberta flat position would be: a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak Alberta portion of the the gas hedge) c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis  See what you think?? 
 Here is the hedge summary for July 3/01.  Two things to note are: 	1) I bought 125 MW of Cal 02 flat from Mirant for a 10 GJ/MWh heat rate 2) There is now a 20 year AECO basis curve, so the fixed price AECO gas from cal 15 on is generated off this curve.  Before the AECO basis curve stopped at Cal 14 
 yes thanks John 
 Yes, he said to leave the reports the same as it is now 
 I tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered.  Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.  Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.  The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.  The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.  The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales) 
 I just need the positions aggregated, I don't need the desks broken out 
 Financial settlement occurs between Enron and the customer.  The pool is agnostic to what its participants do (i.e. generators that do 3rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool, consumers of electricity who do 3rd party physical hedges also pay the pool) 
 I will attend 
 I hope stock goes to $35 so I can buy it at reasonable levels.  Things are well here. 
 Please give Enpower access to Murray Fichten, John Messenger, Mike Taylor, Tyler Seminuk 
 garrett, you should look into buying an advanced ticket to come up to calgary for a week in a week or so, we can go through next steps, fundies, etc.  BTW, we got 3 feet of snow in the mountains this weekend, powder everywhere!!! 
 I was meaning to give you a call this week and inquire as to when you guys are planning to come up.  Things are good here.  Feeling poor as well. 
 John Lavorato already said that he would make JD report directly to Canada. 
 Here are my comments on the original guarantee  My phone is 974-6749 
  Here is the list updated with responsibility names. 
 Here is the spreadsheet that I sent you at the beginning of the year when we set the curve marks to show the NPV 600,0000 CDN. These are the heat rates that I am referencing in the Hedge Summary sheet. 
  If you look at the Cal 03-Cal 10 period, you see that there are roughly 25,000,000 MWh.  Two days ago, 1 had only 6.5 contracts/day hedged. In the past two days, I sold 2.5 contracts/day.  In the past two days, the Cal 03-10 swap has increased C$0.47. 
 Does this information reflect the additions of the IBOC or not? Otherwise the info seems to be what is going on right now. 
 Yes I am 
 I was wondering why I am not eligible yet.  I sent gave my agreement forms to Tricia Henry yesterday. 
 1) For a full requirements deal, I would like some sense of the load shape of the customer.  Having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal. 2) The all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price, it is dependent on load shape. 3) That is correct. 
 Danielle, in general we need everything that Houston gets in addition to the info that is listed as Calgary on your spreadsheet.  One information source in not listed on your sheet.  IHS Accumap		Priority 2	Contact: Carmen (403) 770-4503 phone, (403) 874-4218 cell  Can you tell me if anyone in Houston is working on setting up accounts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS, ESBI?  These are gas and power related entities that we have to have accounts with the schedule physical gas and electricity. 
 can we possibly move this meeting up from 3:30 PM to sooner? 
 they are working it still 
 subject to mechanical inspection from the Vancouver Porsche dealership. 
 We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.  We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.  It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.  The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28. 
 you should request this from eric ledain or derek davies, they have the current list 
 yes i gave him a verbal 
  i lifted it last night for 82,000 
 will this be video conferenced in calgary 
 Can you send me the Jan 18 trades and marks as well as today's trades and marks before 3:00 PM today,  thanks  John 
 A buddy of mine is selling this stuff and is just starting out, if you need a helmet, contact him. 
 no the packages haven't come in.  Kacz's called a we are going to pick up the gift.  Warburg is still progressing, just waiting on offer letters.  I will be in charge of canadian trading, that will include ontario power - a new market that i will have to learn about. 
 can you prepare how the ontario market works presentation for myself and derek davies 
 No I never got the sweater. I was thinking about that on the weekend.  I'll pick up the gift for you. 
 hey janet, i haven't received the new phone in number yet, not sure if you have it yet 
 WOW, that was higher than I thought.  That is not much different than mine and higher than other Directors in the office.  I am not blowing smoke, but given my experience, there is nothing that I can do at the immediate time. 
 i don't even know your salary now. 
 I am reading your mail, I have asked for the same thing regarding my base. Especially since I came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 CDN/USD and with no raise since being here at 1.61 CDN/USD I have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in Houston.  Not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 USD/year lower than what other shops are offering.  However, after three attempts, I have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause. 
   Can you send my curves and trades for Jan 18 
 Can Dorland and Chad meet me and Mili in Video 1 at 9:30 and when these guys come back can Cowan and Lambie come to Video 1 
 After some brief discussions with UBS in Houston, we must wait before we can make final determination of our functional currency.  We may be evaluated in Canadian dollars rather than American.  I must get some direction from UBS 
  403-974-6706 
 do you have the internet addresses and directory details put togethor yet 
 I can't afford to bump anyone, unfortunately all the people on this list are top notch.  We are trying to separate the cream from the cream.  Given that, and working on the assumption that Dan D is a rock star (i.e. not knowing him from Adam otherwise) I think we should relace Lalani with him. 
 Cooper is doing fine he is still breathing according to him 
 Check out www.segalmotorcar.com 
 things are going well,hectic but more steady now that we are bought by UBS, at least steady in mind  jess is doing well, just 6 weeks left, she is getting to the uncomfortable phase now  how are you doing in portland? 
 Yes, he worked for me, he ran the AECO option book, we let him go since we were not sure of our future at the time, he is setting up the BP Amoco options desk  He is a very smart guy and understand options very well, he is late thirties and has been trading for some time 
 congrats to Ali  I had to fly to houston on monday on last minute notice, we have been bought by UBS Warburg, I hope that the deal works out and looks good for me, don't know yet but I am excited, how is the condo going? 
 can er make this earlier, not sure I'll be in fri aft 
 Is is possible to import a lotus elise and get it converted to left-hand drive and road compliant?  I was wondering if you knew how to do it and how much it would cost  Thank you. 
 Here is a list of products and counterparties 
 Nella here is a list of products that we would launch on EOL in NETCO.  Assume the the products listed under the Financial heading are launched on day 1 and the the products listed under the Physical heading are launched at a later date. 
 Enron Canada Power Corp acknowledges the change in the sink asset from CH1A to CH1U for contract #1947 for the period of Jan 01, 2002 HE1 to Dec 31, 2002 HE24   Thank you John Zufferli 
 i waited for 15 min, i guess the conference call was cancelled? 
 what is your number at work? 
 If the legacy deals move to NETCO then we need the ability to trade Canadian gas.  Canada would not be out of business if we only traded US denominated financial products but it reduce our daily transactions by 75%. 
 Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since:  a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential creditor action against Enron.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.  b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new Enron deal) are there.  c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at 4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.  d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this category, but not like a mortgage.   Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run. 
 I am interested in a program for myself.  I am 33 years old, have been inactive for 6 months.  I am 6' 1'' and 225 lbs.  I can easily ride 50 km at about 27 km/h on flat terrain.  I would like to lose 15 lbs, improve my speed an definitely improve my hill climbing ability.  I live at 3800 ft altitude and hill climbing is very difficult.  I hit lactate threshold fairly quick.  Thanks 
 yes 
 Its OK  John Zufferli 
 you can increase the direct sale to include Dec 31, 2001  Thank you  John Zufferli 
 You should talk to Jess about that, she is due March 2 but I am not sure when her mom is coming and going.  I would think that the 2 week in march is good though.  Look forward to seeing you tomorrow. 
 Here is the update list that you requested. Mike Cowan, Chris Lambie, Chad Clark, Chris Dorland, Lon Draper Cooper Richey, John Zufferli also needs access to the Nymex EOL website.  Mike Cowan, Chris Lambie, Chad Clark, Chris Dorland need access to US west and east basis markets as well. 
 i am waiting on the conference call and no one is on it yet? 
 nothing new here, when is your flight? have you found any condos yet? 
  In addition to a list of software and systems that is being compiled for th= e Calgary office, all required spreadsheets for the Calgary trading operati= ons (i.e. the sheets that the traders use) has been compiled in "secure on = 'ectcal\calgary'(I:)\Trading\NewCo" 
 Please set up access for the digital certificate under Enron for TAU and I understand that they will have access to report viewing and submissions.  Thank you.  John Zufferli 
  Here is the info for the commercial staff  John Z 
  Enron is willing to perform the operation under question (1) but not (2) and (3) as we have no control over these processes and only have control over process (1). The System Controller can contact Enron Canada Power Corp at the number in your files.
