o?  Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?  Tom Donohoe 
 Here is the contract information.  The contract group could not locate the CES-Devon contract so all I have is the info from TAGG and Sitara.  For the GTC and GISB contracts that have no paper, I wrote price and location on the EXCEL spreadsheat.  Tom Donohoe 
 I am in need of several more contract copies.  Could you please forward me contract: 96037261 96049419 96001003 96045391  Also, you had mentioned earlier that GISB contracts should not have been used on some of the contracts I earlier received.  Are the appropriate contracts going to be sent out,  or are we stuck with the ones in place.  Call with questions.  3-7151  Sincerely Tom Donohoe
