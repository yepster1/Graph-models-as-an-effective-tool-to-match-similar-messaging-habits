 million dollars.  I have learned a valuable lesson about how business really works.  As an employee, one should milk their company for everything they can get out of it no matter how many people are hurt.  Enron has been a cutthroat stab you in the back organization for a long time.  I always thought it was just my fellow employees doing every thing they could to get ahead.  I never realized that this was the creed that senior management lived by. Senior management must have been in their offices rolling on the floor every time some employee spoke up about trying to make vision and values a success.  You and your teams fine example has changed my life forever.  Aside from the fact that my kids will no longer be going to college, you have changed my thinking for ever.  I will never again believe anything my employers tell me.  I will never again put my company as a top priority.  It is a travesty what you have done to so many peoples lives.   Tom Donohoe

As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.  What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offer
