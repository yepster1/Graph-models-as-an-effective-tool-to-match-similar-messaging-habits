.  We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?  I understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.  What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans.  Scott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?  Getting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.  Please sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.  Tom Donohoe

 It appears that the 16,000 was extra gas that the terminal overdelivered.  The imbalance is between the terminal and trunkline.  Dan Masters has agreed to take all these imbalances and net them in january 2002.  ENA has no responsibility for this gas and will not allow it to be put on our agreements.  This will only create an imbalance we will be cashed out on.  In January 2002  the price we settle up at will need to be decided at that time. 
 Audrey,  Martin, Jason, and Kevin were asking the status on the Sempra deal.  Are you going to call them and discuss what is going on?  I am not sure what to say.  Tom Donohoe

 Dear Pastor,  For the last few weeks I have been under all type of excessive work related stress.  I try not to bring any home but this last weekend I was at my wits end and it my family noticed my change.  The more I thought about my situation the more uptight I got.  I didn't know whether to quit or trudge on.  Then came Sunday morning.  I got to my 4 year old class and the troubles were all absent from my mind.  Teaching those kids got my mind off of all the troubles.  I got into the sanctuary and the first words of your sermon, concerning people with problems, were directed right at me.  In a matter of moments I realized I had been trying to deal with these situations on my own, asking no help from the Lord.  In an instant all my stresses were lifted completely.  It is so wonderful the way the Lord works.  He had you plan a sermon that was timed perfectly for the moment I could take the mess at work no longer.  The rest of my day was great!  I came into work this morning and some of the things that were causing stress turned around for the better.  The Lord is great at reminding us who is in charge at all times.  This is not the first time a sermon was perfectly timed.  Just after you joined us, one of your sermons was just what I needed to hear when I was at my wits end.  Thanks for a great sermon and hallelujah to the Lord for watching over his flock.  Sincerely,  Tom Donohoe

 I got the info but wanted to know more about the preset programs.  The net advertisement shows 20 preset programs, but the info I received only shows 4.  I also wanted to know what the display looked like.  The literature does not show what the display  looks like.  I have what the 9.2 looks like but it appears that the 9.6 is different.  Also how fast does this machine get to. This machine has a 10 year warrenty.  Who will service this in Texas and If for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of my warrenty.  On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is a hill workout, time or what ever?  What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?  Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?  Tom Donohoe
