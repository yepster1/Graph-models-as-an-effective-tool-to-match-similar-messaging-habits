o get them certified by the highest accounting officer.  Last year that was Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting. Will he be signing again? 
 I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.  Steve Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.  Not as to legal.  He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her comments to me for forwarding to you.  I will let you know as soon as I receive your comments. 
 Were you serious about our conversation Friday, or were you kidding me?  If you were serious I'd like to talk to you about it. 
 After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received it.  With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me with this?  Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract numbers for our financial masters?  Thanks! 
 Below is the memo from ISDA that needs to be read in conjunction with that Master Netting Agreement. 
 Here are the descriptions again. 
 Taffy, you were going to check on how much vacation days I have left.  I wanted to take a few days when my mom comes in for XMAS.  Thanks. 
 I checked around and that is the most recent copy we have.  If I can be of any help whatsoever, let me know! 
 How about Thursday, next week? 
 I got Edward's markup of the description, and wanted to run it by you when you have a minute.  Let me know... 
 Thanks for your help! 
 One personal day this monday. 
 Thanks Bob.  The couch is always open, tho' (obviously!) not always helpful! 
 List looks good to me! 
 I didn't know you sent the market description to Awais, so I was following up.  I'll mark it out. 
 Here are your three remaining descriptions.  Please note that Harry has asked that Mark Taylor review the plastics description.  Mark is out of the office and will not return until Monday. 
 Awais, I sent you all these.  What happened to them! 
 All the descriptions except weather have already been emailed to Awais and I have asked him to provide them to you.  I understand you have weather which was faxed. 
 Mike,  You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and that appears not to have happened yet.  Can you please let me and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.  Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.  Brent, can you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals (Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.  Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a document tracking database in B.A.  Who should he contact here to get a new database created similar to ours?  Thanks for your help! 
 Brent,  I have asked several times to get you access to Lotus Notes.  If we don't get you access in response to this latest email, we may need to kick it higher.  Hope you are doing well...we miss you! 
 I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our meeting.  I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and haven't heard.  In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360 days.  So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like to change that to 365/366 accross the board.  I asked them if there was any specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's the custom in the bank/dealer markets.  Anyway, I'd like to get that answered. 
 That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.  I have attached the proposed form of confirmation.  I have combined in it the usual tax language we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company (Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through non-U.S. branches (England).  Please let me know if the tax language meets with your approval. 
 Brent,  I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement database and using it for your contract applications.  It is my hope to use it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to developing a similar system for you. 
 I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP issues. 
 We have added the new One Way, Cash and Letter of Credit Collateral Annex to the back of the Industrial Master.  It is still located in my form directory, called industrial-u.s.#5.doc. 
 I'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today.  We really do have a problem getting responses from our computer people, so I hope a relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response. 
 It's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the latest.  Mark thought London may have made some additional changes.  Can you email me the latest draft.  Thanks! 
 Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT Canada that went into bankruptcy.  It shows up on my list because I'm working off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.  I just want to make sure that we don't send them any mailouts. 
 Just checking to get a status report on your offsite.  I hope there was no frivolity or frolickling had by anyone...! 
 I've found a great website to check on utilities (trying to figure out if a counterparty is one, or whether its a governmental one).  It's at www.utilityconnection.com.  It even has non-U.S. utilities.  When you have a minute, give it a look. 
 Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks! 
 Here are the descriptions for power. 
 I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp. "signing" the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.   Actually what Utilicorp. did in this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 of the agreement).  They signed accepting joint and several liability with respect to the obligations.   If we can get them to agree to the same language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better than getting a guaranty.   Anything less (like just sticking their "name" on the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.  All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.  Let me know if I can be of further service... 
 Sent again. 
 Sign off on Canada. 
 It turns out that Jeff Hodge made plane reservations for 1:30 pm on Wednesday.  Can we move that meeting up to 11:00 am? 
 We have dinner reservations for Saturday at 7:30.  Reservation #189. 
 I will be able to attend. 
 Access to the online trading system?  If that's the questions, probably none of us. 
 There will be a demonstration of the Online Trading Application for trading lawyers and paralegals on Wednesday at 11:00 am in EB2601a.  This project continues to be highly confidential. 
 For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it sounds like a utility or governmental.  Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me? 
 Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the counterparty.  Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of incorporation of the counterparty.  I will not assign the review of Italian law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.  If you feel we need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start looking at it. 
 Per the notes below, Jeff Hodge signed off on the description Awais sent us with no changes.  NOX and SOX are attached also. 
 I am also reforwarding the coal description. 
 FYI 
 I noticed we have 2 entries for cpy in Lotus Notes.  We need to delete one. 
 Mark,  David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not so sure it's correct.  We think it should reflect two huge power price spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.  We don't think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes.  Can you take a look at it and get back to me...thanks for your help! 
 Per the meeting today, attached is the latest counterparty list in Excel. 
 Just a note to make sure that I get any updates to the approved Counterparty list.  I will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's approved counterparty list here in Houston. 
 Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.  The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information. You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell. 
 I am going to meet with Tom at 3:30 (after our ice cream social at 3:00) to go over my latest list of questions to the 2nd credit list, so how's about discussing any other financial issues we might have then... 
 I gave Shari my whole file on Canadian cash collateral issues to look at. You may want to get it from her.  It has Fred Erickson's phone # in there also. 
 Scott, one of our crude oil traders passed on the attached resume of one of his friends and asked if we could take a look at it.  I gave it to Mark Taylor and since the fellow lives in England he thought it would be better sent to you. 
 Unfortunately, providing Matt with the ISDA Master is a problem.  It's got the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell us, Enron North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT International).  Sorry... 
 I'm a little confused.  Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3) both? 
 I have added Shari's MAC clause (when there is no collateral annex and MAC is an additional event of default) as an alternative in the MAC clauses for the ISDA Master Agreement contained in ISDAexh.doc. 
 Yes, I put together a package of stuff and sent it to you.  I don't know how long mail takes to get there.  It will probably be there I hope in today's mail. 
 I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement database.  I understand that you are the person that can get them access.  This will continue to be an issue as we expand our trading offices around the world.  Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent and Andrea access.  Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.  How does Brent go about getting this new database created?  Thanks for your help! 
 Carol made some proposed changes to the MAC language and asked me to send it to you to get your input. 
 Mary, although this presentation is for the Legal Dept. I thought maybe if you have a representative from your group there it might be helpful.  Do you have someone, like Mary Gosnell, that you would like to attend?  Let me know, and I'll get their name added to the list. 
 Have you sent these to Steve Kean? 
 The Legal/Credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 1/2 hour until 2:30 pm. 
 If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.  We're always looking for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!  How are you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well as others...! 
 We do not have a copy of the executed agreement for our files.  Can you have one of your assistant's copy it for me as well as any relevant guarantees, credit support documents, etc.  Much thanks... 
 Well, it turns out that Mark Elliott needs a revised draft of the UK ISDA incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to Gibraltar counsel for the legal review he's working on for Gibraltar law.  So, I'll work with Mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the London legal team for approval. 
 Thanks for the material.  I've been really busy at work.  At some point when I have more of a break I'll call you. 
 Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English culture, the Morris Men.  I've got their website bookmarked.  Y'all are a goofy bunch.  Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with switches.  It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English culture to me.  I am constantly amused!  If y'all would only cheer at marathons...! 
 Shouldn't we be setting a time for a form meeting so we can review those documents (Deemed ISDA, legal opinions, etc.) I distributed a while back? 
 That may not be so easy an answer.  I think we would have to talk to Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies. Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and we'll give them a call. 
 Here's that email....! 
 I'm working with Mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online trading.  Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.  Should Singapore be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?  Are there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the governmentals, such as the utilites?  Are there any products that might not be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others? Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our agreements?  Any guidance you could give us with this would be most appreciated!  How are you and the baby doing?  We hope to see pictures on your next trip over! 
 Thank you for the lunch invite.  I put on the calendar..."lunch w/sweet yao".  Can't wait! 
 Non-Smoking Room please.  Preferably a suite with a wet bar, sunken tub, view over the pool, and complimentary room service.  Not to mention my own private valet. 
 Well, Mr. Elliott, I do believe I am quite shocked at your allegations of me being the troublemaker.  My review hasn't gone in yet and I guess I am going to have to mention...that you are the troublemaker! 
 Wonderful job! 
 Per Mark's conversation, you were going to get back to us on the scoop on France and utility counterparties.  Any update? 
 What do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the master in, but we have a bad certificate, and no trading should be done until we get a new certificate? 
 How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.   Your visit seemed all too short.  We probably won't see you for a few years, but I really enjoyed our dinners and chats.  Stay out of trouble and make us proud! 
 The meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements. 
 The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some time.  The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to the gents and is becoming quite the rage.  Fashion trends are quite slow in reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.  Has this trend crossed the Atlantic?!  Has Justin bought a pair in red?  We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch! 
 Taffy, can you work with Nicola to get this conf. call set up with London, in Suzanne's absence.  Thanks! 
 I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.  Obviously, everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.  She looked up Gary Bode, who Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager, but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.  She suggested for the Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good, or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very expensive!...just kidding!)  I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.  Perhaps we should set up a meeting to talk to Phillipe Bibi about the Fishkin project, so we make sure we get a good person assigned to us.   What do you think? 
 You forgot to have me off the week of Thanksgiving too.  I know I mentioned that to you... 
 No word? 
 I have noticed that humility is one of your most pronounced character traits!  Am glad you responded and look forward to seeing you... 
 At Mark's request, I am transmitting proposed changes to the collateral=20 arrangement language in the Online GTC's.  Please let me know if it meets= =20 with your approval.  8.  Collateral Arrangements.  Counterparty shall (at Enron=01,s request) fr= om=20 time to time and at Enron=01,s option either:  (i) within one Business Day = of=20 such request by Enron, provide to Enron a letter of credit in respect of=20 Counterparty's obligations under any Transaction, in such form and for such= =20 amount and from such issuer, as is acceptable to Enron in its absolute=20 discretion; or (ii) within such period as is specified by Enron, provide fo= r=20 the benefit of Enron a guaranty from a party, in such form and for such=20 amount as is acceptable to Enron in its absolute discretion.  Failure so to= =20 provide such letter of credit or guaranty or any default under such letter = of=20 credit or guaranty shall constitute a default hereunder giving rise to the= =20 immediate right of termination by Enron under this Transaction. 
 Per our conversation, the additional "to do" list is:  1.  plumber still needs to do his stuff 2.  put up new light fixture in back bedroom 3.  fix broken window in Peter & Nancy's front bedroom.  You'll need to call them to let them know the day you're doing it. 
 I'm out Tues. and Weds. at an in house seminar.  How does today or Thursday sound? 
 Thanks for taking a look! 
 When you get back, I got a call from Koch about the Morgan "assignment".  As you recall, we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with their commodity business.  Koch called me and they want to get a copy of the "assignment".  Since it wasn't an assignment, what should I provide them?  I don't know that I can provide them a copy of our Servicing Agreement.  What should I do? 
 Per David Forster, they should be doing the online trading simulation tomorrow. 
 Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades thereunder.  So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.  So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put:  "Need board resolution prior to trading" 
 To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists:  Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.  As noted below, an additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.  FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week. 
 I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.  Do you need me to make you a copy or are you also getting updates?  Also, I get faxes of all their notices.  So far nothing I've received has been interesting.  Do you get copies of their notices?  Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth noting?  They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and ask Mark for a raise to match my title! 
 I thought of you this weekend.  It was the fall antique festival in Round Top and I went, but it wasn't quite as nice as the pleasant day I had with you and your family.  That was such a perfect day all around and I will treasure it.  I hope all is going well.... 
 So I don't forget for Monday, Shari just send around the Canadian "eligible swap participant" language to be inserted in all Canadian confirms.  Don't we also need to add that to the Canadian online GTC's? 
 Yes, the list is the final approved counterparty list before the roll out of the system.  All counterparty lists are due by the close of business tomorrow.  If you are not sure of what the current approved counterparty lists are let me know. 
 That's ok.  Our trading policy doesn't allow you to trade anything we trade. 
 Do not worry about that new product type.  It doesn't pertain to you.  If you see none that looks like power you might want to pay attention.  I know Jeff has been getting similar emails. 
 The document wasn't in the blue file either.  I called Tanya and asked her if she could fax us up a copy of it.  Also, I asked her to let you know what her thoughts were on the proposed amendment.  Do you want me to call Rick at BMO and let him know you're working on it? 
 Just a confirmation, we have the following lawyers scheduled to attend the upcoming conference:   you, Justin, Paul and Jon.  Is that correct? 
 See Lotus Notes 
 Lovely note, crummy master.  It makes Belco look good!  I know Olin Corporation only because they had a plant near the summer camp I went to in North Carolina and there were days when the stench from the plant pervaded the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains where the camp was located.  That plant manufactured the plastic wrap that went around all those cigarettes they were making in North Carolina.  I kinda remember them being a plastics company back then. 
 Attached is the latest draft of the referenced GTC. 
 Font of useless knowledge! 
 Would you like to respond?! 
 Per Mark's earlier emails and conversations, we have 10 govt's/utilities with masters in place that are approved to trade, with about another 30 currently being negotiated.  The other 30 or so will only be approved to trade when we get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto (like legal opinions). 
 Just an FYI  About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the referenced counterparty.  She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.  I got a call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.  I called John and gave him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals before trading, etc.  I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get the trade, we're not surprised. 
 We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers still have not received notification of our name change.  This is causing problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.   When will you be able to get this notice our of our name change? 
 I have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change, but the NYMEX says the brokers have to file some form with the CFTC, and they can't file that form until they receive the notice from us. 
 How can you be on vacation this week if you are responding to this email? 
 We have tried to get the computer people to respond to your request for Lotus Notes access, but they don't respond.  Mark, what do you think the next step is? 
 Mark, open up felix the cat.  He is adorable! 
 As far as your email questions, my responses are following:  1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow. 2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me. 3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway. 4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with. 5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say "not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the financial net worth test. 6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note. 
 Attached are the revised online GTC's.  The weather GTC's won't change except for the credit support language, so I thought that you could make that same change when you made it to the rest of the GTC's. 
 Did we order that special UK sized paper?  I still have to copy that OMLX stuff for Mark Elliott's binder there in London. 
 Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.  His work was top notch, his subcontractors did a great job.  For instance, I put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house. I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.  Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his additional time or money on.  To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you pay. 
 Rod,  Nella sent me a Compliance Certificate and financial statements for the referenced counterparty.  I am forwarding them down to you. 
 I don't have anything specific to weather, I have material from recent general seminars I've worked on for Mark T. and Mark H. if you need it.  I do have general articles on weather...  I'm glad to see they have the "A Team" as a speaker.  You're marvelous! 
 The 1st list attached here is the one I used for the 1st list you have. 
 Per my voicemail, below are the revised online GTC's.  Sorry for an inconvenience this might have caused you. 
 I spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today.  He will only be in the office Mon. and Tues. of next week, so if possible, he would like to set up a demonstration with us together at your desk on the computer so he can work us through the software.  Let me know when a convenient time would be for you, maybe Tuesday sometime? 
 A reminder for when you get back on Monday! 
 I spoke to Mark Taylor.  How does Tuesday at 11:00 am sound? 
 11:00 am Central Standard Time (1 hour earlier than New York). 
 What's the scoop on the TXU negotiation?  Brant says we're in a strong negotiation position with them right now, because they've acquired Howard's book and need our consent, and also have to post an expensive LC with us to take in those Howard trades.  He wants to know if he should use our leverage here to get that ISDA Master in place. 
 Brent,  I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me know.  Thanks! 
 Just a note, if you've got some recent pictures of your daughter to bring them... 
 Attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's. 
 Anita sent me the message below re: board resolutions to trade out of Singapore.  Can Singapore trade out of the board resolution that was approved for ECT Interntional, or are we going to have to get another board resolution signed allowing financial trading out of the Singapore office? 
 Per our discussion... 
 I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you usually do? 
 Edmund,  Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.  I don't know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, ECTRIC can sign directly. Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, Managing Director or Chairman.   It looks like the London based officers who could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's signature.  Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for signature, as also will your London Credit person.  Congrat Anita!  This is very exciting! 
 No, I haven't met Matt, in fact, I don't know much about him.  Is he here now?  For how long?  Thru the Legal Conference?  I would be happy to help in whatever way I can.  As you know, we've recently revised our forms, so this would be a good time to get him indoctrinated.  I will, of course, be sad to have you leave us.  You have been wonderful to work with from both a personal and professional standpoin.  Your baby's gain in your time is a loss to Enron, because are a most valued asset to our company.  I hope our lives will cross again some time!  Best wishes for your future, you deserve the best! 
 Mark, should we forward Carol's email to Bill, so he knows what the issues are? 
 Regulatory made some changes to the power description and Awais wanted Legal's sign off again and needs a response by tomorrow.  Will that be a problem? 
 With respect to Online Trading, Mark wanted me to follow up with you re: insurance/reinsurance company issues.  Per our earlier conversations, I am saying "no" to online trading for all insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with.  The online people have come back and said, hey wait a minute, you are already trading with insurance companies without a master, i.e. Swiss Re.  They are wanting to open up Swiss Re for online trading and any other insurance/reins. we are currently trading with without a master in place.   Do you have a list of those companies?   What are your feelings about that?  Can we trade online with Swiss Re?  How about any other insurance companies you are currently trading with without a master in place?  Or do you want me continue to say no?  Thanks for your help! 
 The Icon worked and I've pulled it up and can use it.  Thanks for your help!  How's things going there?  Are you getting excited about going back home? Have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you?  Everything cool on the roommate front? 
 I looked at Gillian's website and she is adorable!  What a cutie!  I've bookmarked it and I'll keep looking for updates. 
 I'd like to attend! 
 Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the online trading issues.  We have to get similar letters out to some of the South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.  Much thanks!  By the way, weren't you out for vacation?  Did you have a good time? 
 Leslie Hansen was out today so Elizabeth forwarded your language to one of our power attorneys in the Portland office for review.  I have some minor clean up changes from Elizabeth, but except any material changes to come from Christian Yoder in our Portland office.  As soon as I receive Christian's comments I will add forward them on to you. 
 It just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with Mark for other countries, that I am approving online trading for Mexican counterparties we have a master in place with, however, in my later thinking, did our advice from Mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of online transactions? 
 I have forwarded on your email and fax to Marie Heard.  She was already working on that issue, what a happy coincedence! 
 When are you coming in?  When shall we have dinner? 
 Below are my responses to your email:  1.  Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation in the master only:   per our conversation. 2.  CMS Marketing Services & Trading:  Trading is limited to fixed price swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options.  This limitation is contained in the Company's Trading Policy, which they have provided to us.   We cannot trade anything except the types of products listed in the trading policy. 3.  Venezuela:  per Mark's conv. w/Dave Forster, we do not want to pursue the due diligence on this country at this time. 4.  Phibro, Inc.:    see note #1 5.  Swiss Re:  See my note 11 below. 6.  Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency transactions.  This should solve our problem so we should be able to open them for trading any commodity. 7.  Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above. 8.  UBS AG.  They recently sold their book and got out of the energy commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest rate transactions with them.  Their master is also trading limited, and we could not trade energy commodities with them without amending it or doing a fix similar to Tokyo Mitsubishi. 9.  Aspect Resources.  I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master. 10.  Brant-Allen:  Their Board of Directors limited the trading we did with them to only the one trade we did under the master.  We cannot do any other trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from their Board of Directors.  So they are still "no" for online derivatives trading. 11.  Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not address.  When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation & bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions.  All kinds of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type of counterparty.  We therefore have to continue to say "no" to online trading based on these special handling procedures. 12.  Cox and Perkins:  We could say "yes" to online derivatives trading, however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have a master in place with. 13.  Kinetic Resources.  Ditto comment 12 above. 14.  Midland Cogeneration.  Still under review as to regulated utility status. 15.  Praixair:  see comment #1 above. 16.  Tembec.  The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided to us .  I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed above.  Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password Application.  Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these special signatory requirements. 17.  EW Scripps.  Same comment as #1 above. 18.  Maritime Electric.  Is a Canadian utility.  No Trading.  Critical Changes to my list:  1.  Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in Mexico.  However, we can still not do financial trading without having a master in place. 2.  Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this resolved, we are switching them to a "no".  Per my meeting today with Credit:  I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility or an eligible swap participant.  I'll be working on those tomorrow and will get back to you.  My Review of Your List:  List #1  1.  BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from your list.  This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with. ECT has a master in place with them.  Trades would roll under the ECT Master.  The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to energy price swaps and options.  No weather.  Case of Credit override.5 2.  Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and trade with this counterparty.  Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to do with these situations when we have more than one master in place. 3.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping issues I am going to have to talk to London about.  First, here in the U.S. Morgan got out of the energy commodity business.  We, in fact, "bought their book".  We actually couldn't "buy their book" because of our low credit rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity business.  Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap (not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix.  Saying all that, I don't know what, if any, trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S.  I need to talk to London and find out.  So Morgan right now is a big open issue. 4.  Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty. Houston has a master with this counterparty.  Trades should be done under the master.  The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of the Credit override. 5.  Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2) Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place, approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master, would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place, approved for all trading.  List #2  1.  Cabot Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 2.  Callon Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 3.  EIL Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 4.  Fortune Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 5.  Plains Resources:  Missed "X" on all weather 6.  PXRE Corp:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only 7.  St. Mary Land & Exploration:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 8.  Stratum Group:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 9.  Tempest Reinsurance:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only 10.  Twister Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 11.  United Salt:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 12.  West Texas Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather  List #3  1.  Bargo Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 2.  Belco Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 3.  Cross Timbers:  Missed "X" on all weather 4.  Encore Acquisition:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 5.  Norfolk Southern:  You've got them restricted for everything, I've got them as "OK" for everything 6.  RMS Monte Christo:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 7.  Sapient Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 
 In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks! 
 We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for advice? 
 Bob Shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different product groups' confirmation and GTC forms.  The two issues out of the meeting I was asked to bring to your attention were:  1.  Attaching the Online GTC's to the outgoing confirmations.  Per our discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all outgoing confirmations.  That does not seem to be the general consensus. There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going to do.  Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts. 2.  The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  First, after our discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a "B" approved GTC with credit.  Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to him.  I guess the physical people are OK with that.  I don't know what discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want to have this confirmed for him.  Also, along with the credit override of the master, there is supposed to be some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.  Who will be drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups? 
 Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the updates below.  Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday. 
 Shari, per the emails below, have you received or do you have any other advice we need to add? 
 Thanks for the smiles!  I am busy this weekend, but if you're in town, how about doing the nickel tour and Village Shopping the next weekend?  If not, maybe another time when you are available.  Let me know... 
 FYI, we are also going to send out a memo to Columbian counsel requesting advice on online trading and asking them for any other general update to their earlier advice. 
 Below is a confirm issue for handling.  Chris, in the future, please direct your confirmation requests to Susan Bailey, who is the current paralegal on the confirm rotation, or if the request is for an Annex B, to each of Susan Bailey, Susan Flynn and Marie Heard.  Thanks! 
 Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do? 
 Shari said our new counsel was supposedly better counsel and that's why we asked for the update from them. 
 Pat, remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power deal with Duke.  You might want to get in touch with Federico.  Mark, FYI, also, I don't know if there are any problems with power out of Argentina. 
 Liz and Christian Yoder reviewed the description since you were out. 
 Last week I left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that Bob Bowen needed you to sign off on.  He says he never hear back.  Can you call him and give him the sign off.  Thanks! 
 Can you do me a favor and look to see if we are doing any financial trading with the following counterparties:  Florida Power & Light Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company Dakota Gasification Company Hydro-Quebec Enmax Corp.  Much thanks! 
 Per my meetings with Credit and further research, I am making the following changes to the financial counterparty approval list.  Credit/Mark, let me know if you disagree with any of my changes.  List #1  1.  AES Power Inc.:  no master in place, changing to "yes" , approved for financial trading 2.

AGIP Petroleum Company:  no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading 2.  Ball Corporation:  no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading 3.  Bank of America International Limited:  no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading 4.

Heritage Gas Services, LLC:  no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading 7.  Ormet Corporation:  no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading 8.  Swift Energy Company:  no master in place, changing to "yes", approved for financial trading  Bob, there are a few others I am still re-reviewing, I will get back to you as soon as I resolve/answer my questions. 
 How did we ever resolve the two signed masters situation for Elf Trading S.A. (ECT & ECt Int'l)? 
 Another counterparty change, for Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership.  We will switch that to a "yes" but only if they accept online GTC w/o change.  This is the one where they wanted an exculpation clause for the partners, and that is totally unacceptable. 
 I discovered it was a non-ISDA master, so I had to delete the weather. 
 I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all financial trading.  She has also been discussing the utilities with outside counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.  She is going to bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully we'll have some more changes for you next week. 
 To remind me to discuss this with you when you get in:  We received via our fax notices from the OMLX a request to provide them with information about our Y2K readiness.  When you have a minute let's look at the form together.  Probably Alan will have the answers. 
 Pat,  This waiver has to deal with a provision in the ECT master swap agreement that requires that the agreement and its contents be kept confidential, except to certain people like auditors.  It did not allow the agreement to be provided to affiliates.  Duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement in has in place with ECT and use it for this Duke Energy International that is doing the deal down in Argentina.  Duke Energy cannot even provide Duke Energy International with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ECT's permission to give them a copy of the agreement.  That it what I am trying to resolve, whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give Duke Energy International the right to look at that agreement.  Your issue, obviously, is what business Federico is doing.  My issue is more of a documentation/legal issue. 
 I stopped by to see you because Mark got in the mail a blacklined draft of the prospectus from Bowne on the weather offering and I wanted to see if you got your own copy or do you need me to have one made for you. 
 Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project I have been working on.  The press releases went out last week.  Mark Taylor was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.  You may have read in the papers about our new Enron Online, our new web based commodity trading system.  You can view it at www.EnronOnline.com.  Mark has been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of work for him.  Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts, which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether we should approve them for online trading.  As you can imagine, that has meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and trading restrictions.  As far as my "Fishkin" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals, objectives, etc.  We've found a few new software programs we've been looking at, some we found out Enron already has.    Mark and I are discussing what we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our thoughts soon.  Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design the software.  This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA opinions and the like.  We need that up and going desperately.   We, have been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put this database together and start loading the information.  So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!  P.S.  Thanks for the article! 
 Just a note, you know, we more or less made the same changes to the Industrial Master that we made to the ISDA.  If you are using that form at all you should update it to include our changes.  I think Paul mentioned in his presentation at the seminar that you were using the Industrial as the basis form for Norway.  Anyway, if that is the case, we may need to look at that form.  See, you're always in my thoughts!  Missed you at the seminar.  I hope we'll see you at one of these soon! 
 I hear you had dinner with our friend Molly Saturday night, what happened to the relatives?! 
 When you have a minute, PECO called with an authorized trader list problem and Liz asked me to bring it to you for handling... 
 Angeline  Will you be sending the ISDA Agreement for signature directly to Mark Frevert?  I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate before Kate Cole, obviously, certifies to his signature.  How do you plan on doing this?  Perhaps we should have Edmund Cooper in London coordinate the signing.  What are your thoughts? 
 I will send a copy to you!  We miss you... 
 I called Edmund Cooper and he is out on vacation til Monday.   Do you think I should email him the certificate, have him print it out there in London, I guess Anita has to initial the two ISDA Master Agreements for signature, then Edmund could get them initialled by  Credit in London, and then bring the certificates and agreements up to Mark Frevert for signature.  What do you think? 
 If you've got the copies, why don't you save them as a form into your system and use them to draft the Caltex Certificates.  Send them over to Edmund with the ISDA Master Agreements.  Leave him a message asking him if he could help you get the agreements and the incumbency certificates signed, then have him send the certificates to me for Kate's signature.  I think that should do it. 
 Thanks for your email.   It is important on a going forward basis that if we veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to your email I have the following comments:  1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all. Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement. All their  trades must be done by telephone. 2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all! 3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and Aspect. 4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time. 5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade. 6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master. 
 I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.  The presentation was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and swap agreement form templates.  I need to talk to our confirm desk people to see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were hoping this system could address.   They had one concept for form generation I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.  The concept was this "data dictionary".  It made it all clear to me.  I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come back to us before I leave for Europe in June. 
 Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest counterparty list:  1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only 2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather? 3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved 4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list. What happened? 5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA Master Agreement this week 6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be restricted for all other products 7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement in this week 8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather 9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather 10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD weather swap is ok 11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not a utility.  Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading. 
 Per my conversations with Credit, the referenced counterparty is the New Jersey incorporated sub of a German company, a liquids based counterparty, and they are an eligible swap participant.  We do not have a master agreement in place with them.  I am approving them for all financial trading. 
 Per Peter's request... 
 I have received the Unanimous Written Consent of the Board of Directors of Enron North America Corp. dated 11/10/99 appointing Dale Neuner and Robert Shults as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of the Company  for online trading.  The original Consent will be sent to Kate Cole for inclusion in the corporate minute book and copies will be sent to Dale and Bob.  When signing the Password Applications, Dale and Bob should sign them as "Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".  In the absence of Dale or Bob, any V.P. or above can sign Password Applications (with initials from Legal).  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me. 
 Per the request of Lorna, attached is a blackline of that legal opinion. 
 It appears Susan Bailey still can not get in and edit the master swap agreement database.  She now has the icon, but no edit priviliges.  Can you please get her access.  Much thanks! 
 Can you forward to Karen a copy of the lastest Electronic Trading Agreement. I'm not comfortable that what I have is the latest.  Much thanks! 
 In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap Agreement Database.  Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the information.  This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, Portland  and Buenos Aires offices.  The only information we need to continue to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client privilege issues).  Access to this information would continue to be limited to Legal and Credit  In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and Credit have access to the Portland General masters.  Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading issues.  Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to have this information and access available by that time.  In addition, we have remaining "kinks" in the database we need to resolve.  Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the changes.  Thanks for your help! 
 How about Wednesday at 10:00 am? 
 Please find attached Annex B.doc. 
 Barry Tycholiz has asked me to confirm for you that we do have a master in place with Husky.  We do, indeed, and I will shoot a copy down to you. 
 I faxed over some changes Thursday.  I deleted all references to ECT and ECT Legal Advisors being a party to the opinion.  Haedicke is an officer of ECT International, he is General Counsel and Managing Director, and so he can sign as such.  No need to pull ECT into the opinion when unnecessary. 
 Mark wanted me to let you know he is reviewing your legal opinion and will call you with his comments. 
 What is this email about?  Do I need to do anything?  Also, your attachment is unreadable because the columns are overlapping. 
 I was told this was supposed to be an Omnibus, not a Deemed ISDA. 
 Attached is Annex B.  Just tell them they need to fill in blanks in guaranty. 
 I checked our records and we do not have any Master Swap Agreement with either K&N Marketing or Kinder Morgan.  Perhaps Credit knows something about this.  In addition, we cannot approve any merger documents until we get copies of the merger documents filed with the relevant Secretary of State. Marilyn Colbert usually provides them to us. 
 Pam,  Per the email below, we will be terminating the transactions referenced below today.  Can you fax me the confirmations referenced in #1 below so I can make sure I have referenced them correctly.  Much thanks! 
 Attached is the proposed form of Termination Agreement.   I have requested copies of the relevant confirmations from the Confirm Desk to confirm that the transactions are referenced correctly.  Please let me know if you have any comments. 
 Mark Taylor asked if we could make one additional change to the database. He wants to move the "Restrictions" right after the counterparty name so it's the first thing the dealmakers see when the open an entry.  Thanks, we really appreciate your help! 
 Please find attached form of Deemed ISDA.  When you fax it to the counterparty can you please attach to the back of the fax  IRS Forms 1001 and W-8.  Much thanks! 
 Mark asked if you could add something else.  Could you add an additonal drop down that follows "Legal Contacts that says "Historical Contacts".  We wouldn't want anyone else to see that but Legal and Credit.  Thanks! 
 Peter,  Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine. Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we have in our form, so we're changing our form.  You are the man!  I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok there.  I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving holidays.  If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to be reachable.  Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, Taffy will have the number).  Let me know if I can be of further help today! 
 If you need to get hold of us next week, Mark and my cell phone numbers are as follows:  Mark:  011 44 7881 512 535 (dial like you were calling London) Tana:  (713) 206-8080 
 We seem to be getting alot of questions about the name changes of the various Enserch/TXU entities, so attached  is a comprehensive list.  A copy of the notice will be sent to the usual suspects. 
 Attached is a sample ISDA Schedule.  Please remember to attach the preprinted form of ISDA Agreement.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Miss Tana Jones 1714 Wroxton Court Houston, Texas  77005  (713) 529-1038 
 Can you please give Sara the NYMEX numbers to review while Mark and I are out.  Thanks! 
 Peter,  Is there anything I need to do on this project? 
 I am in room EB3802.  EB3890 was my old office. 
 Thanks for the article.  I will distribute it to our group and Credit.  With Online Trading quieting down a bit, Mark and I are finally focusing on "Project Fishkin" (as we call it).  I am already getting a new database developed, the jurisdictional database, to keep track of swap laws around the world.  We hope to finalize our recommendations soon, and get the project up to Haedicke for his approval.  Of course, Online trading goes live today to our customers, so there's not telling what problems may crop up.  I'm crossing my fingers for a quiet day!  Hope your holidays went well.  My mom came down from New York, and it was colder in Houston than it was at home! 
 If you have a complete list regarding the Enserch entities we wish to trade with, I can run it by Enserch and check on the legal names.  I think it would be helpful for our full distribution (Legal, Confirm and Others (settlements, Global Contracts, misc), if you would distribute a full list of the Enserch entities we wish to continue trading with and what business out of each entity.  I think this will stop people coming back and asking again and again. 
 Frank,  Mark asked me to handle this.  Can you forward to me the name and phone number of the person that signed the password application?  Thanks. 
 Peter,  I looked at the Banque Paribas Agreement.  It is an ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of June 28, 1995.  The Agreement was executed between ECT and Banque Paribas.  Banque Paribas changed its name to "Paribas" on May 11, 1998, so I think you need to change the agreement  and signature line to read "Paribas, formerly known as Banque Paribas". or something to that effect.  The agreement is governed by New York law. 
 Pam,  Peter Keohane, our Calgary attorney, is working on a termination of some trades between ECT and Paribas and needs you to fax or send him the following confirmations ASAP, Deal nos. EA7484.3 and EB3772.3.  Thanks yet again! 
 From what we have been able to determine, it appears that the City of Riverside is not authorized to invest in any types of financial derivatives. 
 I sent the UBS Letter to the confirm desk like a week ago, I forget who to, maybe  Bernice, since I kinda consider it an audit letter.  My note said the confirm desk can sign off on the letter since they were only asking us to confirm trade information.  The Teeside Confirm, I spoke to our tax guys this morning and they said they were really busy yesterday and hadn't had a chance to look at it...I'll call them again. 
 Thanks for the update! 
 Joe,  I just found out Pam is out today and Peter needs these confirms ASAP.  Can you get them to him.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your prompt help with this!  I know Peter appreciates it. 
 I asked  Richard Ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he didn't know, but he was going to get back to me.   I think in his job in Fuel and Energy Risk Management, he is probably the business contact.  He probably makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging.  He also wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place.  I spoke to Liz Sager and she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority issues, there was no reason not to do financial energy.  As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment, I just did that manually.  I spoke to the Lotus Notes people before I went on vacation, and among other changes, they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address and it will notify people to see Lotus Notes.  Of course, the only groups that will have access to the comment sections of Lotus Notes (for confidentiality purposes) will continue to be Legal and Credit.  But we are going to open everything but the comments and "priority" screens to any interested business people.  I'm going to move the "restrictions" bar right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they will see will be any restrictions.  Then, I'm going to add a drop down for online trading, approved or not, and then a comment screen (that only Legal and Credit can see) so we will have some notes about why we approved them or not (some of us are getting old and can't remember things!). 
 I got a call from the Lower Colorado River Authority today asking us if we would like to put a power enabling and ISDA Master Agreement in place with them.  I spoke to Liz Sager and it appears we have already done a physical power trade with them.  Of course, we can still not do financial trading until we run through all the hoops with them.  I don't know who you directed your marketing package to, but he wanted some information on online trading and I said we would send him a packet.  Richard Ramirez Fuel and Energy Risk Management Lower Colorado River Authority 3701 Lake Austin Boulevard Austin, Texas  78703  Thanks! 
 We have resolved the authority issue with referenced counterparty, and have approved all financial trading, including online financial trading, under the executed ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and this counterparty dated June 23, 1999. 
 In response to your email re:  Richardson Products II, this counterparty was approved for trading (without a master then in place) under my initial list of approved counterparties.  Per the email below, we then received in the signed master and the distribution was notified. 
 Yes, I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions.  When I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a different path.  Something that yall will find helpful... I've been working with the Lotus Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.  I am adding drop downs for "approved for online trading", so you will be able to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.  I think other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in terms of the financial contacts.  I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.  I hope this is helpful! 
 In response to your email, an amendment to the referenced executed ISDA Master was sent by Susan Bailey to the Counterparty on 11/23/99.  With respect to the credit, this amendment provides for an increase in the Counterparty Exposure Threshold from U.S. $3,000,000 to U.S. $5,000,000, and amends one of the MAC provisions for Counterparty by increasing Counterparty's Net Worth from CAD$85,000,000 to CAD$150,000,000.  Certain other changes are being made to agreement including amending certain of the the LC provisions, as well other changes to legal terms that will incorporate our recent form changes.  THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED.  Other credit in the agreement not being amended includes 3rd party debt default for Counterparty of CAD$5,000,000 and U.S. $50,000,000 with respect to Enron Corp., an Exposure Threshold for ECT Canada of $10,000,000, and a MAC for ECT Canada tied to a drop in Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating below "BBB-" from S&P.  The other MAC for Counterparty that is not being changed is if Counterparty's ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 1 to 1.  I hope that helps...let me know if you need more info or if you need me to fax these documents to you. 
 1.  Vitol S.A., Inc. - already approved for financial trading this morning, master in place. 2.  Nicor Enerchange-approved for financial trading, no master in place. 3.  Helmerich & Payme Energy Services, Inc.-approved for financial trading, no master in place. 4.  Ashland Speciality Chemical Company-is a division of Ashland, Inc. Ashland, Inc. is approved for financial trading, no master in place.  CONFIRM DESK:  WHEN THESE CONFIRMS GO OUT, we consider this counterparty to be Ashland, Inc.  We want Ashland, Inc. to show up as the company name and on the signature line.  If the counterparty wants the division name there, we can sign it "Ashland, Inc., acting through its Ashland Speciality Chemical Company division", but we want the company name there and on the hook.  Let me know if you have any questions... 
 I still do not appear to be getting copies of all credit worksheets.  Please remember to keep me on this distribution. 
 Just a note to remind you about something we need to discuss tomorrow, Transco Zone 6. 
 Why don't you send them directly to Kate, with a note to return them to you. It might speed things up. 
 Aquila wants to trade online under two names, Aquila Risk Management and Aquila Energy Marketing.  They have asked us to attach to their ETA, a listing, and copies, of all master agreements we have in place with those two counterparties, whether physical, financial, gas, power, etc.  Can you look those up for us and copy the relevant contracts?  Thanks for your help! 
 Attached is my response to your 12/1/99 list. 
 Molly,  Why were the counterparties on your latest list under the Legal tab different from those under the Credit tab? 
 The counterparties below for review are under the Credit approval tab. Please let me know ASAP if they are approved to trade. 
 Attached is another list for approval.  Under the comments section, if it says "declined" you do not need to review it because Credit has not approved the counterparty to trade, if it says "division" it means that it is a division, and Credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty name to the right, if it doesn't say anything, it means it has been approved to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing. 
 So you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future, not Susan? 
 If you open in "view" you will be able to see it.  Thanks for your prompt response! 
 You get a gold star for the week! 
 That seems reasonable to me!  Ask the Swap Paralegals, no matter what the problem is, my answer is "well, you know what that means..." and they all respond "we can go home!".  If they only made me boss... 
 In connection with Enron Online, please add the following people to your email distribution list for new contracts or any contract or counterparty change:  Karen Lambert, Frank Davis, and Carrie Southard. 
 Attached please find a proposed form of Termination Agreement for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Obviously, we need to still input the trades.  Peter,  It appears that our signers on the trading floor will be offsite in PRC meetings on Thursday.  I need to know ASAP when we plan on signing this because I am going to have to call around to find an officer that might be in. 
 I forget my attachments all the time.  Sorry! 
 Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 12/3.  All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be ignored.  If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to look at it.  If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going forward basis.  Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.  We rarely expect counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.  Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis.  Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 
 What is was is that the document was in Word 95 and we work in Word 97, so I just had to go in and open Word 95.  I think what you are doing is what they are trying to get up and going here in Houston, but they're not ready yet. Mine and Mark's questions to you is who goes down the Legal List and says yes or no to trading? 
 Attached are the final lists for this week for your approval.  Again, if I do not hear from the respective physical trading groups in 1 day I will assume that all counterparties are approved. 
 Just a note to Group after discussion w/paralegals and Mark:  on a going forward basis if our counterparty is a hedge fund, we will ask for all corporate documents, plus a copy of their prospectus (which should show us what the fund is allowed to invest in). 
 Shawna and I are both sitting here so excited to get your note.  Are we available?  For Chapman?  Of course!!!  Shawna's answer is...both nights, many festive drinks!  We are only limited by the thought of choosing just one night over the other!  If we have to, we will.  We leave the choice to you, because we are available either night...    Jon Chapman 12/14/2000 11:11 AM 
 Just one note.  I have a typo in your company name in the address, it needs an "r".  Fax it back to me at 713/646-3490 and I will get it signed by Enron.  Thanks for such a quick response!    "John Dean" <john.dean@excambria.com> 12/14/2000 11:22 AM 
 Below is an email Dovie sent out a while back referencing the procedures for sending out NDA's.  When you need an NDA, please email me the following information.  I then contact a paralegal that maintains a database of our NDA's to check for conflicts.  Once we've done that I will prepare and send out the NDA as directed by you, then work with you as appropriate in the particular client situation to get the NDA back signed.  Once it is fully executed I need to send the original to the same paralegal here who is the central gatekeeper of all NDA's.  My number is x33399 if I can assist you with anything. 
 If you think the attached would be helpful to any members of your group, please pass it on to them... 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Excambria, Inc. and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 12/14/00.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 We hav received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between PVM Oil Associates Limited and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 12/12/00.  A copy will be sent to Bob Shults and Dave Samuels. 
 Another list! 
 My understanding of this NDA is that London gave it directly to Craig Chaney to get executed by the counterparty.  So, David, I think you need to get a copy from Craig, and then forward a copy on to me. 
 How did it get to be that these people are drafting their own NDA's.  I thought our agreement when we met with Dovie Keptra was that I would draft them.  I would prefer every time not to have to figure out what they've changed. 
 I ran this by Leslie, and she has no problem, so go ahead and send it out to your customer.  If you could please keep us in the loop on the status of any negotiations or execution...Thanks!    Peter Feltman@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/18/2000 10:47 AM 
 Attached is a current list of the NDA's we are/have worked on for your groups.  Please take the time to review this list and confirm the status of any NDA's you are interested in. 
 We do not appear to have received your fax of the NDA.  Can you please fax it to my attention at 713/646-3490 and I will distribute it to the members of the Enron Team.  Thanks!    RHarris@Credit2B.com 12/13/2000 02:01 PM 
 Thanks!    RHarris@Credit2B.com 12/19/2000 07:32 AM 
 Per Leslie's email please open FPC for all US power ASAP. 
 Are you approving this for financial trading?  Per our conversations last week, I thought it would not meet the eligible swap participant criteria. Let me know.... 
 Nope, I'm going to need someone to do approvals that week after XMAS...    Leslie Hansen 12/19/2000 12:56 PM 
 There is some misunderstanding.  I still have not received the fax of the NDA.  Did you have it to my attention, Tana Jones, at fax no. 713/636-3490?    David P Dupre 12/19/2000 01:19 PM 
 I've got it now, thanks Robert!    RHarris@Credit2B.com 12/19/2000 01:32 PM 
 We have received the faxed copy of the fully executed NDA dated 12/13/00 with the referenced Counterparty.  I will send a copy to David Dupre, Matt Dawson in London for the UK files, and Kay Young for the Houston files and database.  Thanks to everyone for their help! 
 As we discussed, attached is the LOI revised to make some typographical type changes.      Lorraine Becker 12/19/2000 12:07 PM 
 Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to the following people:  Anita Fam Brenda Whitehead Elizabeth Sager Jason Peters Stephanie Sever Christian Yoder Lorraine Filomeno Shari Stack Susan Flynn Lisa Lees  Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments):  Tom Moran and Veronica Espinoza.  Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit access:  Cheryl Nelson.  Thanks! 
 Kimball, Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments, even tho Credit didn't have them marked as such.  Kimball, I am ok with the change adding physical gas, they were previously shut down for financial and power, and no change there.  Bay State was previously shut down for financial and power, no change there, OK with adding physical gas.  The Energy Authority, I had previously shut down for financial, open for all power.  Now, per Leslie, have them open for US power sells only, so I'm changing that.  Hetch-Hetchy Water and Power is a division of the City of San Francisco, so I am shutting them down for all financial. 
 Per your request, attached is the "BETA" Agreement.  Mark also thought Bob might want the Broker Fee Agreement. 
 Has Mark given this to anyone to work on? 
 We have several ISDA with Lehman Brothers.  Attached is an Icon that will allow you to view the Financial Trading Agreement Database, which all the Legal Dept., including the London Legal Dept. should use to track their financial master agreements.  Matt Dawson know how to use this database, if you need to visit with him.    Link -->    By copy of this email to Mike Neves, I am requesting that you be granted full edit access to this database (Mike, Denis is a lawyer from London).      Denis O'Connell 12/21/2000 03:44 AM 
 FYI I will be out of the office after lunch today and will return 12/27/00. Have a good holiday! 
 Per Peter's voicemail, there is no standard ISDA form of parent guaranty.  I have attached the standard Enron Corp. and Counterparty guaranties we request under and ISDA Master, as Peter requested. 
 We have received a fax of the fully executed NDA from London.  I am having a copy walked down to Gillian. 
 Any word back of City of Riverside? 
 I spoke to the traders on the West Desk, and "EPMI Long Term California" should be documented as Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  "Long Term California" is just a book on the West Desk    Julie Brewer@ENRON 12/27/2000 03:42 PM 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions you would like to discuss with me, do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.  If the NDA meets with your approval, please return a copy to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 No action is required by Legal on above list. 
 Thank you, I got your fax and have forwarded it down to my Online Team for signature.  As soon as I get it back signed, I will fax a copy back to you.    Bill Lane <wtl@TradeWellSystems.Com> 12/28/2000 04:26 PM Please respond to "wtl@tradewellsystems.com" 
 Richard,  Below is the resume of a friend of George Hope, a member of the Online Team. As head of legal recruiting, if it meets the needs of any particular group, please pass it on. 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC and the referenced Counterparty dated 12/28/00.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Dave,  Per your conversation with Mark last week, it appears the Confirmation Desk people are still waiting for the "oops trade" language. 
 Unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis... unless I specifically mention a physical product, all physical counterparties will be approved for all the products that Credit has approved them for.  If I have an exception, it will be noted, otherwise CONSIDER THAT THE RULE.  Most of the comments I will have relate to financial counterparties:  For Financial  I am not responding to Credits "declined" counterparties.  1. AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company Ltd.  BAD NAME.  There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta Energy Company Ltd.  I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty if the Confirms go out under that name. 2.  Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc.  We are currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.  We earlier sent out a draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to change the name to Ashland, Inc.  So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc. name, I can approve it for financial trading. 3.  Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.  I have already approved trading under Bayer Corporation. 4.  Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P. 5.  Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy Company.  We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company, which I will approve for financial trading under that name. 6.  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved trading under TMV Corp. 7.  Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.   I already approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.  FIX NAME!  For Power  1.  City of Riverside - per Leslie Hansen, they are permitted to trade pursuant to a GTC with collateral - subject to recieving override letter. 
 Why do I keep getting these new products for approval? 
 From an earlier email from Dovie Keprta:  Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie Hansen (Legal Counsel) (Leslie will be on maternity leave soon, so  Mark Greenbery will be the new lawyer contact) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for executing NDAs.  Leslie/Mark will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.  There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is the only party disclosing confidential information.  When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the following information: 1.  Which form you would like to use 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared 3.  Counterparty's legal name 4.  Counterparty's address 5.  Contact name at Counterparty 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and number or address). 
 Someone must be cleaning out their office, because a notice of a restructuring from Black Stone Holdings Parnership mysteriously showed up on my desk, with no note.  I have no idea if Credit knows about this BECAUSE IT IS SO OLD!  The notice dated 4/19/99, says effective 7/1/98, Black Stone Holdings Partnership transferred all of its assets and liabilities to Black Stone Minerals Company L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership.  Let me know whether or not Credit knew about this already...if not, I'll send a copy down to you.  It was my understanding from way back when that they were no longer trading under the Blackstone financial master, so this may be moot.  If we are trading with them again, we never did get the corporate documents on the partnership from them and we may want to use this as an excuse to get them. 
 As you requested...      Paul Finken@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/02/2001 02:09 PM 
 I just got a call from Deutsche Bank a minute ago, and they got approval from Frankfurt and are overnighting the agreement to me for signature.  I'll keep you posted... 
 We have two new lawyers that have joined our Group today:  Francisco Pinto-Leite and Frank Sayre.  They will need access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  In addition, I am still waiting to hear that Cheryl Nelson has been granted access to the Financial Trading Database.  Can you let me know what the scoop is...?  Also, I left you a message this morning about my new database for online documents...when can we expect a roll out of that?  People keep sending me documents and I have no place to record them...  Thanks, as usual for your help! 
 Per Tanya's comments at our Legal/Credit Meeting yesterday, I would like to have the referenced counterparty come thru again to shut them down for financial trading.  Per Tanya, all financial trading for the Calpine family should be done out of Calpine Energy Services, L.P. 
 Attached is the form of NDA for distribution to your customer.       Peter Feltman@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/02/2001 05:48 PM 
 Carol,  Susan is out today.  Is what you want just a full set of the ISDA documents? Do you need a binder of our internal forms as well?  I have a bunch of trainees coming thru so Taffy just made up a bunch of new sets of ISDA documents and is 3 hole punching them and putting them in the binders...Do you want them messengered out to your home, or just available for you when you get back to the office?    Carol St Clair 01/03/2001 09:41 AM 
 I knew that, I must've had a brain drain!    Lorraine Becker 01/03/2001 10:20 AM 
 As you requested, I am attaching our form of Bilateral NDA for the Enron Networks Group.  Please remember that all Counterparty specific drafts must be prepared by Legal.       Jake Staffel@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/03/2001 11:11 AM 
 Bad news.  We got the Deutsche Bank documents in and they weren't signed by them yet, and none of the supporting documentation was provided.  So, I think we are going to be on the longer side of the execution timetable vs. the shorter side...    Jean-Sebastien Fontaine@ENRON 01/03/2001 11:52 AM 
 You're relentless...!!!    Bob Shults 01/03/2001 03:23 PM 
 You are too good to me!    Bob Shults 01/03/2001 03:50 PM 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 The person we are dealing with is very nice, Stephen Kessler, their lawyer out of New York.  He has been very helpful.  We just don't know how long it will take it to get processed once it leaves our shop.  Our intention is to fedex the ISDA out to Steve tonight.  The Enron Guaranty will take a little more time, so at his suggestion we will follow up with that later, so we can keep the ISDA moving.    Jean-Sebastien Fontaine@ENRON 01/04/2001 01:57 AM 
 Can we open them up? 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 12/19/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.  The original will be sent to Lisa Lees.

 We have received copies of a Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on 12/22/00, effective 12/31/00, wherein El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. (Global Counterparty #72297), a Delaware limited partnership, merged with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (Global Counterparty #53350), a Delaware limited partnership, with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (Global Counterparty #53350) as the surviving corporation.  By virtue of this merger, the ISDA Master Agreement dated 12/01/99 should now reflect El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. as the Counterparty.  In connection with this merger, Credit will be getting a new parent guaranty from the Counterparty.  Upon its receipt, copies will be distributed.  Copies of the Certificate of Merger will be distributed. 
 Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database. Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.  Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I will forward it to them.  We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

 Sounds good to me!  I only wish I could bill by the hour the time I have spent today straightening out issues raised by this El Paso thing!!!    Tanya Rohauer 01/04/2001 03:35 PM 
 Attached is the BETA and Fee Agreement for NatSource.  Let me know if they meet with your approval. 
 Thanks for your prompt reply! 
 OK for me!    Stephanie Sever 01/04/2001 05:03 PM 
 Yes, there will be different legal/jurisdictional issues.  I'm going to have to run this by an attorney familiar w/Japan.  I'll get back to you...    Jake Staffel@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/05/2001 08:25 AM 
 We have a Counterparty on the 1/5/01 List, Accenture LLP that we need to approve immediately.  Can you let me know ASAP whether you have any problems with this counterparty. 
 The above counterparty is approved for all products, except physical power (and the usual!). 
 At the request of Dave Samuels, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the agreement meets with your approval, please return a copy to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  If you have any comments or questions you would like to discuss, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399. 
 Attached are the BETA's and Fee Agreements for:  Power Merchants Group, Amerex Power and Amerex Natural Gas.  Please let me know what your thoughts are... 
 Just as I suspected.  I showed the attached email to Mark Taylor, and he says he still wants to send out confirms, so if Dynegy wants to just throw them out, that's their business, but keep sending them as you would in the normal course of business.    Larry Joe Hunter 01/08/2001 04:22 PM 
 What a happy coincidence about the book!  We'll have to share thoughts when we're done reading it.  The New York Times gave it a rave review, which made it so popular it was sold out for quite some time.  I've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north.  He's having to work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a Canadian counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic ISDA questions that were covered in my class.  I told him if you two were paying more attention instead of clowning around so much...oh well, good thing I can't get him with a ruler up in Canada!  Take care, and I'll look forward to chatting with you... 
 Travis McCullough 01/08/2001 06:41 PM 
 EnronOnline, not Enron Net Works, entered into a NDA with the Enron Gas Pipeline Group.  Would you like a copy of it.    Travis McCullough 01/08/2001 06:50 PM 
 No Japanese connection...    Jane McBride@ENRON 01/08/2001 07:36 PM 
 Are we missing any Japanese counterparties? 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Allegro Development Corporation and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 01/08/01.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I am unable to send you those DynegyDirect docs because my file is missing. I have tried unsuccessfully to locate it, so I am contacting the Online Team right now trying to get copies from them.  As soon as I get copies I will get you copies. 
 Per our earlier agreements with the Online Team, this counterparty is a division and I will not open them up to trade until the incorporated entity is part of the counterparty name.  Our financial contract is set up as "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division". 
 Please mirror what Tom is doing...    Lisa Lees 01/09/2001 02:52 PM 
 Teresa Mandola with the EnronOnline Team has received a call from the TVA. They would like to start trading physical power online with us immediately and would like to see a copy of the Enabling Agreement they have in place for power.  Can someone from the power team provide this to them.  Teresa's number is x39807.  Thanks! 
 I just got off the phone with Aquila's Kansas City attorney about online trading issues and he said he would like to get an ISDA Master in place with us.  He said the contact to negotiate is their Calgary attorney, Carissa Browning at (403) 543-7188.   I told him I would pass on the request to our Credit team.  Much thanks! 
 can you send me the deal terms like we've done before so I can prepare an assignment.  Thanks! 
 I'm passing this on to you for review. 
 I am faxing the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex to you.  I sent a copy to you a few days ago.  I hope you should get it shortly.    Denis O'Connell 01/10/2001 10:26 AM 
 What do you think about this? 
 Who is Mike Bridges?    Bob Shults 01/10/2001 02:25 PM 
 I checked the agreements and we can provide you with copies of both of these, so I am having them copies right now and will be faxing them to you this a.m.    Matthew Dawson 01/10/2001 09:42 AM 
 Per my earlier email, are we trying to get Koch Hydrocarbon Co. changed to reflect the legal entity as part of the counterparty name? 
 Mark Taylor asked me to contact you about the referenced NDA.  He said you were the lawyer for Dealbench.  I'm a paralegal that works with Mark, and we got a call from a member of the Online Team, Dave Samuels, who said that "a lawyer" was working on an NDA for Dealbench, and he wanted to confirm that the agreement reflected Enron Net Works, not Dealbench, as the Enron counterparty.  Is this something you are working on and familiar with?  If so, can you provide me with a copy of what you are working on?  We appreciate your help! 
 Nora,  That you for such a prompt response.   We appreciate it!    Nora Dobin@ENRON 01/11/2001 02:55 PM 
 I don't think I need to be included on these emails about the bandwidth master contracts...    Amy Heffernan@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/11/2001 03:45 PM 
 Attached is the proposed form of LOI for Prebon.  Is Prebon Energy the full legal name of the company?      Bob Shults 01/10/2001 02:25 PM 
 On the attached list:  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company:  Credit is opening them up for Can & US gas, which I am fine with.  I already had them open for financial. Make sure they're shut down for physical power.  Westpac:  I just approved that one on the 1/5/01 list.  There should be no changes from that list.  Enron Australia has an ISDA Master in place with them, as does ENA, so we are OK with them transacting all financial, including all Australia financial. 
 Oops, I sent you the form, not the prebon draft. 
 At the request of Michael Bridges, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of Interest.  If the agreement meets with your approval, please return a copy to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  If you have any comments or questions you would like to discuss, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399, Mike at (713) 345-4079 or Bob Shults at (713) 853-0397.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 Legal has no problems with the amended counterparties on Credit's list of 1/4/01. 
 Jeff,  This is a physical deal which needs an assignment prepared. 
 You are a star! 
 Mr. Harrell,  Thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate.  When we had a big group meeting a few months ago we (Legal) were actually surprised by our success level at that time, but these numbers exceed our expectations.  Since you congratulated Credit, I took it upon myself to also email the message to Credit. too.. 
 What's Bobbie's last name?    Lucinda Kontos <lkontos@swbell.net> 01/12/2001 10:21 AM 
 Are you drafting this NDA for us?  I have already prepared a draft based off your form, which adds not only Enron Net Works, but also EnronOnline as our counterparty.  In addition, we have a company policy that requires that we have arbitration in all of our agreement.  Our client over at EnronOnline, Dave Samuels, is sending our form to his customer.    Nora Dobin@ENRON 01/12/2001 01:42 PM 
 Mark Greenberg, and attorney in our Group, has reviewed your comments and made some minor changes.  If these changes meet with you approval, please fax a signed copy of the agreement to me at fax no. (713) 646-3490 and I will, in turn, have it executed by Enron.  If you need to talk to me about the changes please call me at (713) 853-3399.  Mark is out of the office today, but will return Tuesday.  If you need to talk to him, his direct dial no. is (713) 345-8897. 
 Nora,  I have a call into my business person.  I ran what's going on by Mark Taylor (you know, I'm just a paralegal, Mark's a lawyer), and got his permission to exclude the arbitration language from the agreement.  So I just wanted to run it by Dave, and then we're home free.  Also, I don't know who you had lined up to sign, but Louise Kitchen has strict rules that I have to have someone from her group execute all their documents.  Who would you get to sign?    Nora Dobin@ENRON 01/12/2001 03:35 PM 
 I spoke to Dave Samuels, and if you are having Harry Arora sign it, Dave thought that would be OK with Louise.  So we're on board.  Could you send me a copy when it's signed.  Thanks for your help!      Nora Dobin@ENRON 01/12/2001 03:35 PM 
 Kimie got my last invitation.  If we add more, I'll have to get more.    Lucinda Kontos <lkontos@swbell.net> 01/12/2001 04:14 PM 
 No response is required from Legal for the 1/8/01 list. 
 FYI... 
 I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation reflecting this merger.  Do you? 
 Cheryl,  Please keep me on this list.  I need to get it because on EnronOnline. Please take Susan Flynn off the list.  She is no longer in our group, and I'm not sure if she's still with Enron.    Cheryl Johnson@ENRON 01/16/2001 12:05 PM 
 Sure,  Just make sure that she has an updated book.  Also, can you verify that my book is updated since we use it to make the other copies.  Thanks.    Taffy Milligan 01/16/2001 12:33 PM 
 If Susan's not at the Company anymore, how can she ask to be taken off the list?    Cheryl Johnson@ENRON 01/16/2001 01:40 PM 
 Please send the documents to me at EB3802.  Thanks!    Cheryl Johnson@ENRON 01/16/2001 01:44 PM 
 She was on long term leave for about 4 mos. and then has to reapply to get another job someone in Enron since her job was filled in our group.  I heard she was back in the country, but I haven't heard whether she was going to come back to Enron or not.    Cheryl Johnson@ENRON 01/16/2001 02:57 PM 
 Nora,  Have you got that signed NDA in yet?  My business person, Dave Samuels is calling me about it...  Thanks!    Nora Dobin@ENRON 01/12/2001 04:07 PM 
 At the request of Stephen Abbanat, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.

 fyi 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC dated 1/12/01.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Nora Dobin. 
 Thanks for your prompt help, I really appreciate it!  I am currently creating a list of all the agreements I have or have heard of, so I hope to have something when you arrive tomorrow to review.    Paul Goddard@ENRON 01/17/2001 02:05 PM

 But you have all the others with your name attached?    John Pavetto@ENRON 01/17/2001 05:26 PM 
 We are trying to locate the following agreements IMMEDIATELY for a RUSH project for Louise Kitchen and I understand Mark Holsworth prepared them fro the EnronOnline team.  Specifically we are looking for agreements with:  Agency.com Octopi? D'arcy, Masius, Benton & Bowles USA, Inc.  We have a copy of this signed by the counterparty, but not fully executed by Enron Corp.  If you have a fully executed copy in your files we would love to get one.  Otherwise, I have a xerox of the copy signed by them and we could send it up to you to get it signed by Enron Corp.  Much thanks for your help! 
 Dave Samuels thought I might want to confirm this with you.  I have a copy of an MOU in my files with Aether, but no records of us having signed any agreements with them.  Have you? 
 Attached is a list of the EnronOnline documents I am aware of.  Please let me know if there are any additional agreements that have not been included.  I have bolded those documents I am still trying to obtain copies of (and the person who might be aware of them).  If you have copies can you please provide them to me ASAP.  Thanks for your help. 
 Per John's request, I will be calling you about contracts below. 
 Yep!    Mark Greenberg@ENRON 01/18/2001 08:21 AM

 With this, we're at 498! 
 Paul,  Are they going to fax me a copy of the signed agreement?    Paul Goddard@ENRON 01/17/2001 01:03 PM 
 I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced counterparty right now.  NCPA would like to get a password in place today to start trading, and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of transactions they can do online.  Per my earlier approval, this counterparty can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by Credit.  They, however, cannot trade financial until we get an ISDA Master in place (and have told Stuart they are currently not interested in trading financial).  Stuart said he would be calling Carrie in about 1/2 to make sure this message is conveyed to her.  If anyone is aware of any problems here, please convey them to Carrie ASAP! 
 Is VWD the only agreement you have currently signed on that side of the Atlantic? 
 Also, if a Confidentiality Agreement was executed in connection with the VWD file, we would need to provide a copy of that too... 
 We need to get the signed copy.    Paul Goddard@ENRON 01/18/2001 01:22 PM

 At the request of Ed Sacks, I am also attaching a sample form of Enron Corp. Guaranty. 
 We need to get copies of the merger documents.  Depending of the nature of the merger, we may or may not agree to it, as our document allows, and if we do, we need to determine the impact on our credit.  Can you provide a copy to me and Tanya Rohauer in Credit as soon as we receive the merger documents.  Thanks for the "head up".    Anthony Campos 01/18/2001 02:52 PM 
 No one seems to know about the Proxicom documents and Dave Samuels in EOL said your worked on this.  Is Proxicom ringing any bell with you? 
 Thanks, Jim was the man!    Diana Ovalle@ENRON 01/18/2001 03:30 PM 
 Anthony,  I just spoke to the Entergy lawyer, and this merger isn't effective until 2/1/01.  She will be sending me documents when they are filed with the Delaware Secretary of State.  So you don't need to worry about this.    Anthony Campos 01/18/2001 02:52 PM 
 Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response promptly I would be most appreciative. 
 Karen,  I don't know that I need to get these lists from you that reference the contract numbers.  I really don't know anything relative to contracts numbers.  What was helpful was your memo earlier that listed the rejected masters.  I took at look at it and then distributed it to the Legal EOL team.  Thanks! 
 Done!    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 01/19/2001 09:17 AM 
 I was looking this up for ClickPaper and notice Bob was working on this master.  Wanted to pass on this email from Tanya... 
 Do I owe you any other lists? 
 So what should I do with this? 
 Credit has them as being an "ESP", which means they are an Eligible Swap Participant under the rules of the CFTC.  The CFTC sets financial criteria, such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial products .  Sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria, but Credit may not want to do that type of business with them.    Camille Gerard@ENRON 01/19/2001 10:54 AM

 I spoke to Stephanie Sever with the online team, and Aquila Risk Management is still open as a counterparty, so no problem there.  When we get the assignment in, just tell me, then we will need to open Aquila back up for financial trading (they currently have read status only) and shut down Utilicorp. for financial trading.    Carol St Clair 01/23/2001 02:54 PM 
 Attached is the First Amendment to License Agreement which extends the term of the contract to March 31, 2001.  My understanding is that you will be sending it directly to FT.  Once they have signed off on the form, let  me know and I will get Mark Greenberg to initial it and get it signed by an officer of EnronOnline.  Call me at x33399 if you have any questions or if I can be of further assistance. 
 Do you get these? 
 At the request of Darren Vanek in Credit, we have done some preliminary due diligence regarding the ability of The Public Service Company of New Mexico to enter into financial transactions.  Based on our conversations with them and review of their Board Resolution, it appears:  1.  They are an investor owned utility, not a governmental entity 2.  Their Board Resolution ONLY approves electricity futures, options or swaps, and gas or oil futures, options or swaps. 3.  THEY CANNOT ENTER INTO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OVER 18 MONTHS.  It is imperative that anyone trading with this counterparty be made aware of this restriction  Please call me if you have any questions. 
 Nope.    Sara Shackleton 01/23/2001 05:45 PM 
 Can you take a look at this and let me know what you think...

 Attached is a clean and redlined draft of the NDA. 
 There are two general forms that the online team uses for NDAs.  The first form is bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business information.  The second is a unilateral, Enron Protected Party form and more thoroughly protects Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is the only party disclosing confidential information.  When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please email me the following information:  1.  Which form you would like to use 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared 3.  Counterparty's legal name 4.  Counterparty's address 5.  Contact name at Counterparty 6.  How/where you would like me to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and number or address). 
 We believe the password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.  He will be back in the office tomorrow and Janette will try and locate it for us when he gets in.    Carol St Clair 01/24/2001 03:14 PM

 The NYMEX will hold the following classes in Houston in June. Those of you so inclined might want to reserve a seat now, as they go fast.  All the February classes are already booked.  You can call the NYMEX at 713/658-9292 if you would like to attend.  1.  Introduction to NYMEX Products-held June 7 2.  Intermediate Hedging-June 14 (Intro a prerequisite) 3.  Intermediate Options-June 17 (Intro a prerequisite) 
 Done! 
 Per my conversation with Peter earlier today, below is a list of classes that Mark may want to coordinate his Houston secondment with so he can attend some.  Internal Classes:  Basics of Risk Management:  4/26 - 4/27  filling up-act quickly  Derivatives 1:  4/17 - 4/18  filling up-act quickly 5/8 - 5/9 - lots of room still here  The internal classes book up quickly.  Everything between now and April is already full with large waiting lists.  If he is really interested he should try and sign up for classes immediately.  He can do that by going to the "Development Center" Icon (aka "Ernie").  Then he can sign up on the computer.  External NYMEX Class:  I checked with the local NYMEX office, and their next classes are as follows:  June 7 - Introduction to NYMEX Products June 14 - Intermediate Hedging (intro class a prerequisite) June 17 - Intermediate Options (intro class a prerequisite)  Like the internal classes, the NYMEX classes also fill quickly.  Their February classes are already full.  As I also mentioned, the first weekend in April is when the Roundtop Antiques Festival is.  It is a great way to see the countryside outside of Houston, all the local towns around Roundtop also have antique festivals at that time.  The wildflowers should be in bloom, and that is alway impressive. With the cold weather and rain, we might have a really good year for wildflowers this year.  Anyway, the above may help Mark get the most out of his time in Houston. 
 Don't think so, but I'll check w/the NYMEX and let you know....    Robert Bruce@ENRON Sent by: Robert Bruce@ENRON 01/24/2001 04:38 PM 
 I just spoke to Dave Fuller in the Portland Office about a potential 10 year deal he wants to do as soon as possible with the referenced entity.  As we all know, because of the legal issues that arose out of the "Orange County" litigation, no financial trades should be entered into with any governmental entity before legal due diligence of the counterparty has been completed and an ISDA Master is in place.   Also, besides the usual issues surround the governmental's authority to enter into derivative transactions, we also need to determine whether this entity can enter into transactions as long as 10 year w/o prior voter approval.  Credit, if you will send the credit worksheet directly to me I will prepare a draft ASAP and Sara will review it.  Dave should be calling you with the information.  Christian, if you have done any due diligence already on this counterparty we would appreciate any assistance/documents you can provide.  Thank you all for your assistance with this. 
 It is because we are required to due certain corporate due diligence prior to trading, which we don't do unless they really want to trade financial.  Most of these counterparties are really interested in trading physical products, so we don't bother to do the necessary due diligence.  If they really want to trade financial, we could transact w/o a master, we'd just have to check their corporate documents, file Consents to Service of Process, etc.  If we're doing all that we tend to say let's just get the master in place while we're at it.    Justin Boyd 01/25/2001 03:07 AM 
 I asked Tanya to confirm for me who in Credit whould be getting the emails about signed masters, and below is here response. 
 Just a reminder that I'm going to be in a little late tomorrow.  I'm going over to the old TCB Bank bldg. at 9:00am to sign my loan papers. 
 Thanks Tanya, you're the best!    Tanya Rohauer 01/25/2001 07:21 AM 
 Francisco,  You should have gotten my email back to Justin.  We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.  We are responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London Legal for London based customers.  A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around the world.  We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.  Our office is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while London leads the efforts in Europe .  After we each receive advice we provide copies and communicate to each other the advice received.  Even though we both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept. is responsible for their own clients.  As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.  Since what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.  If a counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time resolving those issues.  As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can certainly change our policies at any time.  All of the above is just what my current direction is from our lawyers.     Francisco Pinto Leite@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/25/2001 08:34 AM 
 Mark Haedicke just got back today.  I'm sure he's been putting out fires this morning and Janette will get back to me as soon as she has a change to chat w/him.    Holly Keiser@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/25/2001 10:22 AM

 Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:  Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  I'll keep you posted when I hear from him. 
 Here is a rough first draft of our jurisdictional database (summary of swap laws).  Besides the obvious typos, how does this work for you? 
 At the request of Mike Bridges, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please sign the NDA and return it to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399. 
 Don't know about the Shell intermediary part.  I hope that will be spelled out in his email.  Also, we have about a 5 year old Local Currency ISDA in Place with them, so we could put the trades under that master.  I don't know if we want to upgrade the master at this time, or just stay where we are.  He said we didn't have a master w/Apache, but when entered my notes into lotus notes I noticed we did.  I called him back, he didn't know ERMS was the same as ENA.    Tanya Rohauer 01/25/2001 02:15 PM

 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of Interest.  In addition, although we feel our current discussions are covered by the Non-Disclosure Agreement between our affiliate Enron Europe Limited and GFI Group, Inc., we would like to enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement directly between GFI and EnronOnline and Enron Net Works due to the ongoing nature of our discussions.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please sign the enclosed documents and return them to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  I will have them executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399. 
 It's pretty darn old and pretty ugly.  1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross currency products under it. 2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000 3.  We've got market quotation for terminations 4.  No arbitration language 5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election 6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore) 7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange Agreement 8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it 9.  Market Disruption Events not standard 10.  Old "ERMS" Collateral Annex 11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold 12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold 13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere  This is basically a REALLY old, it looks like heavily negotiated, form.  This might be a good time to replace it.  I don't know how much trading we do with Apache.    Tanya Rohauer 01/25/2001 03:37 PM

 mary,  are these in the swap forms bank so we can't alter them by mistake?    Mary Cook 01/30/2001 09:19 AM 
 The Finance Group is trying to locate some really old "Master Agreements" done in 1995.  We looked around and we didn't have any masters in place for the counterparties, but I was thinking maybe they really weren't "Master Agreements" but our old style confirmations.  The two counterparties were State Street Bank, as Trustee for Cash I, and Citibank as Agent, for Cash I. The Agreements were listed in the closing documents as "Interest Rate Agreement" and "Commodity Swap Agreement".  Can you look around and see if you have some really old active trades out there for either of those counterparties...?  So not to confuse you, about 2 or so years ago, we did some deals for State Street for the Cash VI Project.  The master for Cash VI is  actually is listed in the Financial Trading Database.  Thanks for your help! 
 Taffy,  Mary is the new lawyer in charge of the paralegals (someone needs to keep us in line, being the wild and crazy gals we are!).  Can you put these re-occuring meetings on my calendar and call it "Paralegal Lunch Meeting". Thanks! 
 Bob,  In order to be able to draft the Aquila assignments below, I am going to need the contract list which shows the contracts the  trades were originally under and which contract they will be under when we assign them.   Can you for that list to me ASAP so I can get started drafting the assignments.  It make take some time.  Thanks! 
 Harry,  Since physical steel is a new online product, I need to know from you wheth= er=20 you are aware of any reason why any existing counterparty should not be abl= e=20 to trade physical steel.  From your perspective, I would consider whether= =20 there is any legal reason barring a counterparty incorporated out of the US= =20 from buying physical steel, or whether you are aware of any current=20 litigation, payment disputes or other similar legal reasons which would=20 prevent an existing counterparty from trading physical steel.  Also, on a going forward basis, is there any legal impediments for any new= =20 counterparties trading physical steel? 
 Lisa,  I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy = an=20 existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new onlin= e=20 product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because=20 counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if= =20 their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  Wh= at=20 I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any= =20 counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterpartie= s=20 up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm th= is.  Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile,=20 because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issu= es=20 specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just = in=20 case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...  I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal. 
 The Firm ID and Password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.  He doesn't recall ever receiving it.  I have to contact ISDA on Mark Haedicke's behalf to locate the password.    Christina Finelli@EES 01/30/2001 01:25 PM

 Are we currently doing any trading out of BT, or are we doing it all under Deutsche Bank now? 
 Yes, Lucinda had a little girl last Friday by c-section.  She  was about 5 lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).  Her name is Sophia Eleni.  Then my brother Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.  He was 7 lbs, 12 oz.  Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over to visit her.  We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it because the baby was early.  I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 02/06/2001 05:37 PM

 I looked at the website and it looked great!  Alena's photo of Chris is really good.  She has quite the eye.  And Chris's photo of the kitties looks like it could be in a kitty calendar.  The photos of Daniel were really good, especially that close up.  He really is a handsome baby.  I am going to have to get one of those cameras so I can send Chris photos to post of the Website.  Maybe we can start the Jones family monthly magazine and publish stories, articles, etc.  one a month.  I can be the editor.  Chris can be the layout guy.  What do you think of that.  We could require every family member to send something in once a month!    "Janet G. Jones" <janetgj@erols.com> 02/06/2001 11:13 AM 
 Per our conversation, can you get Bill added as a VP of Enron North America. He didn't want to fuss Enron Canada or EPMI right now.  Thanks for your help! 
 Correct.  The Services Agreement in place between ENA & ECC is what allows us to transact between the two companies without adverse tax consequences.  We have no such agreement in place with ECTRIC, and the UK tax regime is different.  We cannot transact between ENA & ECTRIC under each others masters.    Anthony Campos 02/07/2001 08:31 AM 
 Sounds good to me.  Just let me know where and when!    Zoltan Trizna <zoltan.trizna@ttmc.ttuhsc.edu> 02/06/2001 08:38 PM

 We have received a letter dated 2/6/01from Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, counsel to Fletcher Challenge, with respect to the acquisition of Fletcher Challenge by Shell Overseas Holdings Limited, and Shell's proposed subsequent assignment of the Fletcher Challenge Canadian nat gas trades to Apache Corporation.  I am sending copies of this letter to Russell Diamond, Mary Cook, Greg Johnston & Joe Hunter.  Russell, I need to know if we would agree to the assignment of the trades to Apache.  Russell, Mary:   With respect to such assignment, we have an old ERMS ISDA Local Currency Master Agreement in place.  Do we want to continue to transact w/Apache under this master, or use this as leverage to get a revised ISDA master in place?  Among the issues I quickly spotted in the Apache master were:  1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross currency products under it 2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000 3.  We've got market quotation instead of loss for terminations 4.  No arbitration language 5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election (maybe I'm blind) 6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore) 7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange Agreement-time to update 8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it 9.  Market Disruption Events not standard 10.  Old "ERMS" Collateral Annex 11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold-is this sufficient all this business? 12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold 13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere  Joe Hunter, I am going to send you down the letter which has what they believe to be all the Fletcher Challenge trades listed.  Do we agree?  As usual, they would appreciate a prompt response so they can get this assignment completed.  Thanks you all for your help! 
 ECT has a policy that prohibits employees from trading in any commodities that ECT trades.  Please make sure any future trading you may do complies with this policy.  Thank you.

 I just got a call from Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline checking on the status of your reviews.  When each of you has completed the review of your products can you let me know, so we can sign off on that product.  Sheri is being pressured by our traders to get this up and is also getting daily calls from the President of Tradespark.  She would like to have everyone's sign off by Friday if possible.  Can you let me know whether this will present any problem.  Thanks! 
 I have created a "Forms" sub-subdirectory under my "Confidentiality" subdirectory.  You can now find the latest online forms there if you need one and I'm not around.  The other forms in my confidentiality subdirectory are earlier drafts of the forms.

 Hey, Queshare, how goes it?  My assistant should have some plane reservations for me by the end of the day to discuss with you!    Peter Keohane 02/07/2001 02:45 PM 
 Sheri,  Shari is our physical power lawyer.  What are your thoughts on the below? 
 Below is Enron's password that will give you access to the ISDA Netting Opinions online. 
 I just got off the phone with Margaret Lester, a contract administrator at Dynegy, and Harlan Murphy, an attorney she works with.  There was some misinformation communicated to them about EOL, and I told them the only way we would trade online with them was under the existing master, not under the online GTCs, we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords.  They want to replace the old ERMS Master with an ISDA and I told them we would be happy to generate the master.  Can I get some credit from you so I can turn around a master quickly, or we will have to work off their form, which will then become an ISDA comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run.  Much thanks as usual for your prompt help!

 My pleasure! 
 We are not ready to execute an agreement with them until we have had some discussions with them about their authority.  Please send them the ISDA then have them call Mary Cook to discuss the agreement.    Dave Fuller 02/08/2001 06:03 PM 
 With respect to the attached list, please note that for Credit's "amended" counterparties, there will be no change in our original approvals except as noted.  Also, I have not responded to the "declined" counterparties, so those noted as such are not approved for any products (I didn't want to go through and "X" out all the boxes). 
 I just spoke to Brent and he still cannot get into the website.  Can you get with TradeSpark and figure out what the problem is and how can we get our people access.  Thanks. 
 I also want to see how your house is coming along...    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 02/09/2001 02:44 PM 
 Yes, I'm trying to get our computer guy to figure out what's the problem.    John Viverito@ENRON 02/09/2001 12:10 PM 
 Attached is revised list.      Anne C Koehler 02/09/2001 10:23 AM 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.  Please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or Bob at (713) 853-0397 if you have any questions or comments. 
 Attached is the icon for the Financial Trading Agreement database which will allow you to look up the status of master swap agreements we are working on. If you cannot read the comments section and do not have edit capability let me know and I will get you edit access. 
 Tanya,  Can you please encourage the Credit team to use Lotus Notes to look up the status of master swap agreements.  If members of your team do not have edit/comment screen access, please provide me with a list and I will get them access to the database. 
 Can you please let me know whether the new attorneys in our group have edit access to the database, Frank Sayre, Francisco Pinto Leite and Cheryl Nelson.  I think Cheryl just tried to add a note and couldn't.  Thanks. 
 Attached is our standard assignment form for financial masters, and a very rough draft of Aquila... 
 Julie,  Just an FYI.  Depending on the type of contract, when I get them in I check them to make sure they have been correctly executed, and then, for the most part, I send the originals to Dave Samuels, who I have designated as the original file keeper for the non-trading related online documents.  I keep copies of the contracts here so we have a backup copy.  I am also working to put a database together so we can monitor what contract online we have.      Julie Ferrara 02/09/2001 05:58 PM 
 Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the system.  He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system, and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.  We cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.  As soon as we have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your review at that terminal.  Thanks for your patience. 
 What is the nature of your project or discussions?  Will our standard language..."information in connection with a possible transaction or other business relationship..." suffice?     Peter Feltman/ENRON@enronXgate 02/12/2001 09:31 AM 
 Please find attached NDA for distribution to your customer.      Peter Feltman/ENRON@enronXgate 02/12/2001 09:44 AM 
 I just got a call from Select Energy and they would like to get an ISDA in place with us.  I told them they would have to go through Credit first.  The person I spoke to was Neil Herzig, Contract Administrator, his ph is: (860) 665-3275.  He said his Credit contact is Valerie Mooney at (860) 665-2387. 
 It looks like we sent them a draft in September.  I called him back and left a message that he needed to contact Susan Bailey & Ed Sacks. 
 Per my voicemail, it appears we sent a draft of an ISDA to Susan Pharr at Select Energy in September of 2000.  Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, worked on that master with Ed Sacks in our Credit Dept.  Susan's phone number is (713) 853-4737 and Ed Sack's phone number is (713) 345-7712.  You might want to contact Susan Pharr to get a copy of the ISDA.  If you can't find it call Susan and she can get you another copy.    herzins@selectenergy.com 02/12/2001 10:38 AM 
 Can you please also get Angela Davis, another new attorney in our Group, edit access to the Financial Trading Agreement database.  Thanks! 
 I would like to take another day of vacation this Friday. 
 I checked with my boss Mark Taylor, VP and General Counsel, and he said it was OK to send you our templates forms.  Per our Confirmation Desk, there are many more Physical templates for all of these commodities, but these are the basic Firm delivery templates.  Nat Gas/Liquids-Financial:  Nat Gas-Physical:      Power Financial:   Power Physical:   Coal Financial: Same as Nat Gas Financial  Still waiting on Coal Physical and Liquids Physical.

 How does the following flight sound?  Flight arriving in Calgary 5:10 pm Tuesday March 6 Flight leaving Calgary 8:05 am Sunday March 11  If those days look good for you, I'll have Taffy book the flights... 
 Yes, I compared their blackline below against the draft I originally sent out, and the only changes were to the counterparty name, "or its affiliates" language, and NY from Texas, the same changes showing in the blackline below.    Mark Greenberg@ENRON 02/12/2001 04:50 PM 
 I'll be there with a whole team from Enron.  I look forward to seeing you there!    <Simon_Platel@aigi.com> 02/12/2001 05:10 PM 
 I just wanted to let you know that I got the revised draft out by Fedex.  I think it may take 2 days for Fedexes to make it up there, so I didn't want you to think it didn't go out if you don't get a copy by tomorrow. 
 How did you decide to handle this? 
 Below is the link that will allow you to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  Please forward this link to any members of your team that might find it helpful. 
 If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake. 
 Attached is my proposed form of Guaranty to cover the US & UK business with Paribas.  Tanya, please note, per our discussion I have increased the guaranty amount to $50mm.  We have also added ECTRL to the Guaranty.  Please let me know if it meets with your approval and I will forward it to Paribas in NY. 
 Kate Cole's office sent me down your executed certificates, and I am going to Fedex them over to you.  Have a nice holiday! 
 Can you get Peter Keohane and Greg Johnston, two attorneys in our Calgary office, edit access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Please let me know when they have access.  Thanks! 
 Need to hear ASAP whether you have any problems with this counterparty.

 Per Genia's email below, please remember that the Power Group would like to mirror any changes to our Guaranty Forms.  If you make any please remember to let Genia know.  Thanks! 
 You'll see that I asked our group to keep you updated on the guaranty form. Carol St. Clair just wanted to make sure that you had our latest form of guaranty, so I am sending it to you at her request. 
 I updated Lotus Notes. 
 Such flattery!    Genia FitzGerald 02/13/2001 04:03 PM 
 Stephanie Panus has a few extra copies at her Desk.    Kay Mann@ENRON 02/13/2001 04:03 PM 
 Bud Ricketts called up and just wanted to get an email of the physical power agreement, I think because he wanted to make comments on the form on the computer so he could prepare a blackline draft.    Shari Stack 02/13/2001 04:37 PM 
 As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Corp., please be further advised:  Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG. All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank ISDA Master Agreement.  No further financial trading should be done in the name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.  All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank. 
 As a followup:  This guys name is Mykhaylo Koshel and he is an outside consultant with the New Concept Group.  I've got a messenger going over to Allen Center to pick up a copy of the agreement with them.  I'll get a copy to you as soon as I get it.    Anne C Koehler 02/09/2001 04:05 PM 
 A week later?    Peter Keohane 02/13/2001 07:21 PM 
 Can we find the same flight during the week below? 
 OK    Mary Cook 02/14/2001 10:09 AM 
 Just want to make sure that you have Lisa Lees and Stephanie Sever with the EOL team on your list of "Others-Masters".  Thanks! 
 No, I just looked it up in Bankers Trust's financial statement filed with the SEC on their website, FreeEdgar.    Bernice Rodriguez 02/14/2001 12:13 PM 
 Susan,  When you get in, can you provide Anthony with a copy of the Aquila master, even if the only copy we have is a faxed signature.  Thanks! 
 Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.  Per my conv. w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S. based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power products, and vice versa.  I don't know how you want to handle that, I have not "Xed" out European physical power from the attached list.  What should we do on a going forward basis? 
 Taffy,  Can you please take care of this.  Thanks! 
 Say it ain't so, Joe...!  Where are you going?!!    Mary G Gosnell 02/14/2001 04:46 PM 
 I called Steve Douglas to check on who should be our tax contacts, and he said he, Jeff Blumenthal and Morris Clark can certainly help us with trading related tax issues.  However, he is grooming Susan Musch to become the lead trading tax person, so we might want to start calling her.  Her ph no. is x56010. 
 Do you want me to call Steve Kessler re: Enron Corp.? 
 Yes, you do not have access to Lotus Notes, because I have been hung out to dry.  They don't have time to keep up with our demands for access, so they want me to do this, and they have sent me instructions and are working on getting me the level of access to change approvals, but I'm not there yet. All things will come...    Cheryl Nelson@ENRON Sent by: Cheryl Nelson@ENRON 02/15/2001 10:35 AM 
 It make take a bit longer.  The computer people will no longer do this for us, I am going to have to do this myself, and I don't know how.  I've got to figure this out.    Angela Davis@ENRON 02/15/2001 12:43 PM 
 Jay,  To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:  1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading agreement. 2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range. 3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs. 4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they suggested a threshold of $10mm. 5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they can/will provide.  If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.  By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message on... 
 It is not clear to me how we should handle this, what do you sugguest?  As a note, I will be out of the office on Friday. 
 My boss Mark Taylor was handling this with Phillip Allen.  I don't know what they ever resolved.  I forwarded your email on to Mark and I left a voicemail for him to please respond.    Dawn C Kenne 02/13/2001 08:51 AM 
 Taffy,  Was this taken care of? 
 Russell,  On Public Service Company of Colorado,  I don't know why you have this on "no financial trades", but if it was because of the contract authority problem, that has been resolved, so you could open it up if that is the reason.  See Lotus Notes for more detail. 
 We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Things may come in a little differently because of Profile Manager (my direct input into the EOL System).  I will now only see amendments to counterparties that have already been approved, thru Profile Manager, they will not be coming in thru the spreadsheets any more.  So, on amendments that affect power, I am going to have to send you an email about the change.  For the above counterparty, we originally had them open for power sales only.  Now, Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid and the offer.  Do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales only, or open them up all the way? 
 Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge. Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather quickly.  Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to proceed on this assignment.  Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe give Bert a call, or what...?  Please let us know. 
 At the request of Rahil Jafry, I am attaching a copy of our proposed First Amendent to License Agreement, which extends the term from February 28, 2001 to April 30, 2001.  If the Amendment meets with your approval, please execute it and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  If you have any questions or comments please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Rahil at (713) 853-3206.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 No change yet.  We are short w/space & computers, and my assistant is working with our computer floor tech to find a computer and some space so our lawyers can log into the system.  Two our our lawyers are now out for the week, our gas & power lawyers.    Sheri Thomas 02/20/2001 10:02 AM 
 Keegan, please include me (as well as all members of the team) on any distributions when members of the Swap Group are going to be out of the office.  This would include Mark Taylor, Sara Shackleton, Carol St. Clair, Mary Cook, Francisco Pinto Leite, Cheryl Nelson, Bob Bruce, Frank Sayre, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd & Stephanie Panus.  Thanks. 
 For Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc., coming thru by Credit to open them for US east power, you already had them open to trade all power under the GTC, so I am going to keep them at that.    Shari Stack 02/20/2001 08:56 PM 
 I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service.    Samuel Schott 02/20/2001 05:43 PM 
 What is the nature of the confidential information being discussed?  Will our standard language "...furnished in connection with a possible transaction or other business relationship..." suffice, or do you want to be more specific? Also, do you want the bilateral form?    Paul Finken/ENRON@enronXgate 02/21/2001 11:18 AM 
 OK by me, have fun!    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 02/21/2001 12:07 PM 
 Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I discussed the counterparty name "Minerals Management Service" with my boss, Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and departments of the US government should have the correct governmental agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say "Minerals Management Service" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is "US Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service".  The way the exposure rolls up under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459. 
 Don't we need to chat about this? 
 Looks good to me.  I'm putting it on my calendar...    Mary Cook 02/21/2001 05:11 PM 
 I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.  What are you discussing with Carr?  Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else? Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?  Who will be providing the confidential information?  It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA once I get this info.  I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on the email.  Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is of the essence...    Daniel Diamond 02/22/2001 08:45 AM 
 Per Wayne Gresham, a lawyer in the coal group, we are having a substantial payment dispute with the referenced counterparty, and George McClellan, the business person (and a Managing Director), would like to shut them down immediately for all trading (which appears to be coal and emissions), offline and online, until this payment dispute is resolved. 
 At the request of Dan Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no.

 With respect to Western Area Power Administration - CRSP.  Can't "ditto" Credit on that one, Credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade. The database reflects that Leslie approved them to trade power already in July of last year, so my intention is to keep them open.  I don't know what "CRSP" means at the end of their name, do you?    Shari Stack 02/22/2001 04:16 PM 
 Never mind...!    Shari Stack 02/22/2001 04:34 PM 
 Sorry about the missing information!!! 
 I just spoke to Credit about one counterparty on the list.  You've got Utah Municipal Power Agency shut down to trade since they're not FERC authorized. They specifically came through online wanting to trade power, and Credit wants to know if you can give them a call and determine if you can get whatever evidence you need to get them open for power.  The name of the guy that sent the application in is Richard Judd and his ph no. is (801) 852-6842.  Thanks!    Shari Stack 02/22/2001 04:16 PM

 No, I havent heard anything back.  Do you want to call them?    Julie Ferrara 02/26/2001 01:31 PM 
 As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the counterparty.  I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.  For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms contained in the atty.fms bank.    Genia FitzGerald 02/26/2001 03:44 PM

 Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades and master sit. 
 Yes, please send this up to me.  Thanks!    Diane Anderson@ENRON 02/27/2001 09:31 AM

 Per our meeting, attached are the current forms of MAC Clauses.  I have added at the end of the list, the Event of Default for change in ownership because I know that one comes up frequently.  Also, I don't know if you want to also suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as our LC form.  The Legal heads of each of the trading groups are:  Mark Taylor:  Financial Trading Jeff Hodge:  Physical Gas Trading Elizabeth Sager:  Physical Power Trading Alan Aronowitz:  Physical Global Markets (Liquids, Plastics, Coal, Emissions & Metals) Julie Murray:  Physical Industrial Markets (Pulp & Paper, Steel)

 I left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with Anadarko located here in Houston so they can trade Brent Crude and IPE lookalikes on EnronOnline under a master instead of a GTC.  We have an ISDA in place with Anadarko, but since ECTRIC is the counterparty online for those products, the trades wouldn't go under the ENA master.  The trader is pestering me about this.  What I would like to do is handle getting this ISDA in place with ECTRIC here in Houston, if that's OK with you, just mirroring the US master (except getting a Multicurrency in place since we have a Local Currency in place with ENA).  Is that OK with you?

 Attached are the referenced lists.  If the Credit Counterparty is "amended" I don't have any changes to what I've previously said about the counterparty unless I add "w/change" (which I didn't have any on these lists, so just keep the Legal approvals the same).   The only counterparty on the 12/22/99 list was a "read only" counterparty, so I didn't bother responding to that list. For physical power, again, even 'tho I'm not saying it, "no" for European based physical power products. 
 I know I'm a pest...but we've got another gov't agency that doesn't have its legal entity as part of the name.  This one is on the list of 2/21/01, and it is the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Department of Energy, acting through it "CRSP" area (I'm not sure what that stands for, it's the Central something something area) (ID#71175).  This particular counterparty has come up before on EOL, acting through another area, the Upper Great Plains Area (ID#81177).  The way I had this counterparty approved for EOL (I thought!) was:  Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great Plains, a Division of the United States Department of Energy.  I don't know if we can go back and get this one fixed too, but it would sure make Legal happy if we did... 
 Some financials from James Hardie have been floating around the company for about a week and they just made their way up to me.  I'm going to have them forwarded down to you.

 The fellow from Alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access to EnronOnline.  We received the executed ETA Amendment about 3 weeks ago and he is really hot to trade.  Can you give me some estimate of when we can expect to get him out of Credit, or call him if there are some credit issues?  His name is Steve Castleberg and his ph: is 608/877-8207.  Thanks!

 Well, I got your new website added as a shortcut in my mail directory, so now I can bother you at will!  Watch what you pray for, you just might get it!  We had a rather uninspiring flight back from New York, Craig watched "Inspector Gadget" on the inflight movie(he said it was really bad) and Danelia read the Bible the whole way.  The only good news is we arrive 1/2 hour early!  The weather was so warm in Houston that we had to turn the air on in the car.  It cooled off a bit today and we need sweaters.  When I got home I spent the rest of yesterday moving my plants back out of the garage where I moved them for the freeze that never arrived.  That's one thing I hate about Houston winters, you can never count on it staying cold so I have to keep moving the plants in and out.  After that, I aired out my house and vacuumed from the stinky kitty litter box.  Then I ordered in Chinese and read three days of newspapers.  Very relaxing!  Don't I have an exciting life?  Keep in touch... 
 Did either of you send this agreement to Anthony.

 We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.  It is located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side opposite of me, at EB3858D).  Since it has taken us so long to get access into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Can you each please confirm to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.  If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason, our floor computer tech, ASAP.  Thanks for your prompt attention to this! 
 Below is the link to our Financial Trading Agreements Database.  This database reflects all the master swap agreements we have executed or out in draft form.

 Did you want this cpy on the list for Legal/Credit meeting?  ERMS hasn't been expanded as an Enron company to be added to list for discussion at meeting, and we have some old ERMS era masters people are working on that aren't getting discussed, and some ERMS era masters that should be unchecked so we do not discuss them at meeting. 
 Please remember that when adding a new counterparty whose name start with the word "The", the "The" should go out the end of the name in brackets.  An example is "Times Mirror Company (The)".  This will help our searching capability.  Thanks. 
 You might want to talk to your Credit team about the Top Ten List for the Legal/Credit meeting.  I think we're only at 3 top ten. 
 I tried ridggway@concentric.net and it didn't work.  Is there some type there? 
 We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products online.  Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.  Justin Boyd in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of the master.  Could you please provide us with credit for this master.  I don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not. Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe and change it for UK issues.  I would suggest unless we really have problems with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.  Of course, send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for the rotation. 
 Attached for transmittal to your customer is the Prebon BETA and Fee Agreement amended to reflect the changes from the LOI.  I am also attaching a blackline so you can see the changes from the first draft. 
 You should now have edit capability in the Financial Trading Agreements Database.

I have also attached a blackline from the intial draft we sent counterparty to the draft we are sending counterparty now, in case you want to show them all the changes from that draft.  That blackline is called prebon.red below. 
 We have received the executed Amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated 2/22/01.  Copies will be distributed.

 John, it's good to hear from you!  A few things on your paralegal friend.  First, we don't currently have any openings, though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience. Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also, we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.  Most of Enron's litigation work is done out of Enron Corp.  They do have a big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also, keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.  Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by Mary Solmonson.  They're always looking for people, and it might be a good way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more options in other groups.  As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.  I'm just surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my mileage to 6.  It sounds like we're both not in fighting form.  But I do want to start training in July with Houston Fit for the Houston Marathon again. 
 We have received the signed faxed copy of the Letter Agreement dated 12/28/99 amending the ETA for the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Just a check, my notes in the database say we had this counterparty open for power, but when I check on profile manager, they have a read only status.  Do we want them open for power or not? 
 Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank into their own subdirectory called "Swap Forms" (look it up just like a person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't know if you can access other subdirectories.  We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms directory.  Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up. 
 My database is not showing that I've looked at this counterparty before, so I need to know if they are an ESP, or not? 
 We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty? 
 Edmund Cooper just called and wanted to know what form changes we have made as a result of the new CFTC Rules.  I told him we just met on that yesterday, and as soon as we revised the form, we would send it to London.  Also, if there will be any changes in our advice to the traders resulting from this, please let him and he will disseminate the information to London Legal. 
 Do you know who in London is actually updating Legal's comments to Profile Manager?  I can't believe Justin does this everyday?! 
 I'm with you on Montana.  I checked the files in the big file room, and it is a Montana corporation.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 03/06/2001 11:19 AM 
 Can you please change the name of the corporation from "Inc." to "Incorporated".  Thanks.

 This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.  I checked my database and we had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.  When I checked Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the bid and offer.  Do you still want them to do power sales only?  Both east & west? 
 Thanks, I know I've been a pest to you today!    Shari Stack 03/06/2001 02:45 PM 
 Is there any reason why this counterparty has transact on NL power?  I cannot believe they have a power marketing license there? 
 Profile Manager also has this counterparty on transact for other European financial products.  Are we really trading those products, because I don't think we should be ...? 
 Taffy,  Can you help Angela with this.  Thanks. 
 This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or "Master Swap Agreement" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!). Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.  Please note:  there is a listing for "Restrictions" which will reflect any trading limitations such as "crude oil trades only", "no trades over 2 years", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We hope to have that information available in the database in the future.  If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get our respective computer people to figure out why.  As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to call me at x33399.  Link -->

 Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  Per earlier emails, no U.S. counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear otherwise.  Also, per my email yesterday, CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Company was already approved yesterday to do basis financial.  All other prior approvals for that counterparty should stay the same. 
 Nope, not yet.  I'm absolutely swamped...!!!  I haven't forgotten about it tho.  My short agenda is Day 1:  Go over basics of financial documentation w/confirm desk team & your assistants (maybe 2-4 hours depending on level of detail we go into) (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 2:  Go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can prepare the Special Legal/Credit Annex for a confirm and review how to read a credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 3:  Spend time with you & Peter going over what I went over with assistants & confirm people, then maybe spend time letting any of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues (spend free time approving online counterparties).  Don't add a lot of people on, I get really nervous speaking in front of large groups...I am a shy girl, you know!  My thoughts are    Greg Johnston 03/07/2001 02:36 PM

 The referenced counterparty is on the 3/1/01 list.  You've got them shut down for power, but Credit's notes are specifically opening them for power. Should I open or shut down? 
 I feel the power!!!    Shari Stack 03/09/2001 11:21 AM 
 I just spoke to Mike Garred and John Raineri w/The New Power Company.  Per this conv. it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade financial and physical gas.  I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the power group, to discuss getting a master agreement in place with EPMI to trade physical power.  They are aware that Credit is working on getting them some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval from Shari).  If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate it, so I'll know to look for them.  I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday, so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly hold things up.    Mary Griff Gray 03/09/2001 01:47 PM

 Below are forms you will need to prepare confirmations which we will discuss later this week.  I would password protect them so no one change change them by mistake.

 Mary,  All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.  London can get into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the o: drive is the atty.fms bank.  If we put the swap forms back there, they can get at them.  I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London.    Mary Cook 03/13/01 09:39 AM 
 Hey Mark, I think these are yours! 
 Attached is referenced list.  Again, no European power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks! 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  On the list of 3/12/01a, I have not yet seen the list from Gobal Contracts with the corrected names, but I cannot believe Lyke Corporation (also called Ripon Community Printers) is a valid legal name.  We might want to get that sorted out before we start trading with them. 
 Attached is the proposed form of LOI.  Please let me know if it meets with your approval, and I will email it to the customer.  I kept the language in the term sheet in the back pretty broad as it references "energy commodities".  Your language re "US crude and products" wasn't clear to me. Perhaps you meant US crude and crude derivative/refined products?  Will energy commodities work, or do want to limit it to crude products and charge more for other products?      Bob Shults 03/14/01 04:55 PM 
 It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the "Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously. The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement is a very bad idea.    Sara Shackleton 03/14/01 05:35 PM 
 I revised the language in the "Description of Transaction" section and where the fee is and just wanted to make sure you were Ok before I sent it to your customer.  I've already drafted my email, I just need your OK.      Daniel Diamond 03/14/01 05:23 PM 
 You need to talk to Stephanie Sever at x33465.    Mark Greenberg@ENRON 03/14/01 05:58 PM 
 Attached is my proposed form of NDA.  I set up the choice in products similar to they way we did it in Prebon.  Take a look and let me know if it meets with your approval. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of Interest.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron Net Works.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or Bob at (713) 853-0397.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 I will attend.  Let  me know what I need to bring.  Thanks for your messages... 
 Mike,  I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us, as well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other agreements access to that information.  Our brokers are quite confidential. The only information we want to make available to all Enron employees is the master swap agreements.  Can you PLEASE, PLEASE take a look at this for me. It is very critical that this drop down works correctly.    Sara Shackleton 03/14/01 06:32 PM 
 Greg and I tried to call you but you weren't there.  We'll call you tomorrow. 
 Sorry about not getting back to you sooner.  I am in Calgary this week. Stephanie and I met with Mark Taylor about this on Monday, and he said to go ahead and confirm this under the Houston master with Hess Energy Trading Company LLC.    Julie Brewer@ENRON 03/14/01 01:52 PM

 The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.  We had a counterparty on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was ID#1836.  Was that one in error?  Are they the same, different?  What's the scoop?  Thanks for your help! 
 I have received the following originally executed documents from the referenced counterparty:  1.  EOL Customer Registration Form 2.  Password Application 3.  Amendment to ETA  These copies will be walked down to you. 
 Sam,  I think counterparty ID# 754 is Bonneville Power Administration, not Bonneville Power Association.    Samuel Schott 03/08/01 05:32 PM 
 Taking a look at BPA from the 3/8/01 list, I noticed that we've got them opened up for west coast power only on the offer and not the bid.  I have no notes that they are restricted in that manner.  What's the scoop?  Marcus, do you see any reason they should be restricted to the offer side?

 Yeah, see if Mark T. will initial it.  Tell him it's for a broker relationship and there we no changes to the form.

 The swap forms have been moved back into the atty.fms bank, so you should be able to access them again. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching the revised BETA and Fee Agreement for your review.  Bob will call you tomorrow to discuss them. 
 Your access to the Financial Trading Agreement has been completed.  Why don't you take a look and make sure you now have edit capability. 
 You now should have access to the datasbase, give it a try and see if it works!

 Do we have an outside counsel memorandum, or will we have an internal one soon, that we can send to Martin (as well as the other non-US swap lawyers)?

 We have received executed copies of the Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement dated 3/19/01 and the Fee Agreement dated 3/19/01 with respect to the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be sent to Lisa Lees. 
 I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the referenced counterparty.  His phone number is 713/752-4514.  He said that VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know.

 I've gotten some calls from the business people who want to trade with two counterparties right away.  One is Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, which is on the list for the 19th, and the other is Mobil Oil Corporation Supply & Distribution which is on the list of the 20th.  Can you please make sure the individuals in Global Contracts responsible for these counterparties update them today.  Our business people would be most appreciative! 
 Thanks for the assist!    Kelly Lombardi@ENRON 03/22/2001 03:28 PM 
 Lunch sounds good! 
 As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not all of the products it wants to trade).  When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the European products, including specifically European physical power products (which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).  Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).  What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone up for unless we really mean it.  So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down for European physical power.

 Sam & Stephanie,  Re:  Cargill Ferrous International  It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc." or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

 Your Manager access appears to be completed. 
 Sharon,  Per the email below, I looked in the financial trading agreement database and saw that Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group prepared an Annex B for this counterparty in January of this year.  I would just confirm that the credit is the same and then use the same Annex B as before.  I am going to fax the credit worksheet that Credit send Stephanie in January so you can check the credit.  Below is the Annex B Stephanie prepared. 
 Sharon,  There are some hanky things going on in these confirms I don't like.  I've just spoken to Russell and I'm going to talk to a swap attorney and then get back to you.    Sharon Crawford 03/23/2001 03:48 PM 
 I spoke to Stephanie and anytime between 9-11 am or after 3:30 pm would be fine for us.  Just let us know.    Esmeralda Gonzalez/ENRON@enronXgate 03/23/2001 04:36 PM 
 I don't know if Mark Greenberg ran this one by you or not, we are already preparing it for signature, but can you check on this counterparty for NDAs. Much thanks! 
 I don't know what you're talking about, so I must not be the right person.    Noveena Mathew-Joy/ENRON@enronXgate 03/26/2001 07:17 AM 
 We are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty.  Our notes reflect that Samantha Boyd sent them up to Peter for execution on 3/9/01 with instructions to send them back to Samantha Boyd when executed. My understanding is that they were signed in Canada and returned to Samantha, but they have not yet shown up here.  If you sent them fedex and can track them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them.  They appear to have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has now become a really high priority.  Thanks! 
 OK with me! 
 Things are looking better.  We tracked down the documents and it appears that Samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 3/15/01.  I just spoke to Maureen Donley-Hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the signature pages of the ISDA and counterparty's guaranty to me ASAP.  Once we get those Russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the ISDA.  I'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in. 
 Brant, please do not put me on emails for day to day business, drafts of masters and confirms.  Thanks.    Brant Reves/ENRON@enronXgate 03/27/2001 08:26 AM

 TFS was sent out but has not came back in signed.  I was out yesterday, so Spectron has not gone out.  I have that on my list to do today.    Daniel Diamond 03/27/2001 10:48 AM 
 What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?  I think this is really confusing for our Canadian team.  There must be requirements for the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.  I just don't think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure out.  What do you think? 
 Linda & Sharon,  My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and Stephanie Panus at x53249.  With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets. 
 We have received the originally signed copy (via fax) of the Termination Agreement dated 3/15/01 with respect to EnronOnlineTransactions Nos. 10000172 and 1000173.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We are closing to finalizing a Lotus Notes Database for us to keep track of approvals for online trading counterparties and any amendments to online trading documents.  Once the database is done, I (and you, I guess) will have to input the data for the Houston and London based Credit counterparties.  I am forward to you this early draft of the database for you to see what it looks like.  You will have to go into "create new counterparty" to see the format once you opened the database up.  We're still revising it to add a drop down for amendments to online trading documents, and then we're going to have a sort similar to the Pending Swap Update sort on Lotus Notes, that will show the Counterparty Name, Approved for Online Trading:  Yes or No, and then follow with any amendments to the online agreements.  This will, obviously, help us keep track of if and why we've approved a counterparty, and also help us generate reports to the online trading team.  Access will currently be granted to the same people who have access to the Master Swap Agreement Database.  If you have any additional Credit Online People to add let me know.  We hope to have it ready within the week so we can start populating it with the information. 
 At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.

 I am OK with what Credit say, which is if the counterparties are already approved for trading those pulp & lumber products theyan trade the new products, except for the following counterparties which we need to be careful about becuase they could only tansact newsprint:  The Bakersfield Californian:  can transact only newsprint E.W.

 Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name? 
 Reggie just brought around a whole stack of confirms of pulp & paper deals that came into the fax area.  Is anyone looking for this stack of confirms? If not, I'll have Reggie walk them down to Joe Hunter.

 Another Division  Mark,  Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss divisions?  What to do?

 Have you had a chance to look at that confirm language yet.  The trade was done a few days ago, and the clock is ticking on how long we can get a confirm out before we get in trouble. 
 Per our conversation...thanks for your help! 
 How goes figuring out why our positions were so far off? 
 Will,  I usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise, so I will also need an email address or telephone and fax number.  I also need to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a one way form that protects Enron only.  In circumstances where we are certain Enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to use that form.  Also, I need to know the nature of the confidential information you are discussing so we can protect the information being discussed.    Mark Greenberg@ENRON 03/28/2001 07:26 PM

 With respect to your email below,  I am already working with Bob Bowen on assigning the various Aquila trades.  On Amoco, I will need to get a list similar to the one Bob prepared for me for Aquila, showing the exact trades being assigned, deal no., whether they are physical or financial, trade date, start date , end date, etc.  If you get with Bob he can show you what he prepared for me for Aquila.  Once I get that I can prepare the assignment.  I will also need the name and phone number for the Amoco person I should be sending this assignment to.  I don't know who will have that, the Confirm Desk, Settlements, or EOL?  Once I get all this I can prepare that assignment. 
 OK for me. 
 I think this one is your to approve (or someone in power). 
 I think it may be possible that we have existing NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty.  The nature of our discussions that I am currently preparing an NDA for is the possible access to and use of a web-based transactions-support system for online and offline commodity trade (including derivative products). 
 You're wearing me down, you're relentless!!!    Daniel Diamond 03/30/2001 03:04 PM

 Thanks.  I seem to be keeping you busy today!    Kay Young 03/30/2001 03:27 PM 
 At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 I don't know what you mean about the positions being "defunct"? 
 It makes me feel so wanted...not!    Kay Young 03/30/2001 03:31 PM 
 I have complete faith in you!  By the way, the guy from Star already called with corrections to their company name, it's Starsupply Petroleum Inc.  He said he passed the agreement on to his legal and he would be getting us comments back on Monday.    Daniel Diamond 03/30/2001 04:22 PM 
 At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of Interest.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no.

We look forward to hearing from you. 
 Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.  Even though we have chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific, and it might be missing some required US language.  I have also attached a redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form we first sent the form to the counterparty.   I have attached our current form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.  The Canadian changes will be color coded, so you can see them easily.  Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no longer "eligible swap participants",  the current terminology is "eligible contract participant".  Please see Part 5(b) of the Schedule in particular. 
 I'm not showing I got your response for this day... 
 Those are negotiated changes.  The only was to tell what is a "Canadian" thing is by looking at the form.  It is color coded with different colors for different countries or other special legal issues.  I believe Canada is a purplely pink color in the form, the footnotes should tell you.

 I never heard back from you.  You were going to look at my list of approved jurisdictions and see if you disagreed with any of my information.  I'll be out the rest of the week, but maybe when I get back we can chat again on the phone, and maybe pull Edmund in, because before Edmund got sick, we were pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about Americas countries and how I should respond about European countries. 
 Strictly informational.  I need to know everytime we have a governmental entity, so since there was no note in the side that this was connected a governmental I had to research that.  I was sharing the information I gathered with you so as to save you some time in case you didn't already know this.  Obviously, you did.    Samuel Schott 04/02/2001 06:01 PM 
 Re:  Usinor SA:  that appears to be a London counterparty.  It should not be on our list.  London Legal should approve their counterparties for ALL products, not only European based.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 03/29/2001 02:10 PM

 While I am out this week can you please send the online lists to Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our Group.  She will forward them to the distribution so we don't lose any time. 
 I will be out from this afternoon through the rest of this week.  In my absence Stephanie Panus will be sending you the EOL Lists.  Please direct any responses you have to the lists to ME, not to Stephanie.  Thank you.

 With respect to that rush Guaranty for the referenced counterparty you so kindly got me on Monday, per our conversation, we will need an incumbency certificate for that guaranty as well.  As usual, I appreciate your help! 
 Just a reminder to check on whether we have an NDA in place or not... 
 Without calling each of the respective traders, we do not know any of the positions. 
 At the request of Stephen Abbanat, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.   We would appreciate it if you could please verify whether "CMS Energy-Panhandle Pipe Line Companies" is the correct legal name of your company.

 1.  If we have a US counterparty we insert the appropriate choice. =20  2.  Revisions to the CFTC Rules have done away with the  "Eligible Swap=20 Participant"  rules for energy commodities (they would still apply to=20 agricultural products).  The rules are still pretty similar however, and th= e=20 current lingo is now "Eligible Contract Participants".  See our revised for= m,=20 attached.

 I got a call from National Bank of Canada and they said that we purchased the referenced company and what did we intend to do with the trade between NBC and Daishowa?  Anyone know anything about this? 
 To confirm our conversation yesterday,  the referenced counterparty can only purchase power in the east.

 Do we had any NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty.  In particular, they seem to be interested in the liquids trading/group.  Thanks! 
 Per my conversations with Bob Shults, Bob Bowen, Mark Taylor and Brant Reves, we are going to open Aquila Risk Management Corporation to trade weather under the EOL GTC's. 
 See my initial email to Sam Schott and Stephanie, about 3rd email from the bottom, there's two samples of how we could set divisions (the same could be said for dba's). 
 To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:  1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people you would like the list circulated to.  2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).  3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).  4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she has prepared that should be added to the list.  If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please call me at x33399. 
 I wanted to thank you and your team for getting this done so quickly.  I really appreciate it! 
 Swap away!    Chris Gaffney 04/17/2001 09:18 AM 
 As a further to my previous email, the EOL Group will code the weather transactions to fall under the financial master, and the Confirmation Desk should confirm the weather trades under the current form of confirmation. 
 I'm sorry about not turning this around sooner.  I thought I might be getting other comments from you.  If it meets with your approval, please sign it and return it via fax no. (713) 646-3490 and I will have it signed by Enron and return a copy to you by fax.      robr@starsupply.com 04/16/2001 06:27 PM 
 We need to act on Marcus's email immediately.  Ed, if you disagree, you need to talk to Marcus. 
 The referenced counterparty is on the list below for online approval to trade us gas financial products.  This counterparty came through before on the 1/20/00 list and we did not approve them for financial trading because of a "payment dispute".  Is anyone out there aware of the payment dispute with this counterparty, and has it been resolved?  Can we open this counterparty up to trade financial?  They are an ESP... 
 As as follow-up to my earlier email, it is now OK to immediately open the referenced counterparty back up to transact both sides of USphysical  power as we have received the necessary documentation evidencing their authority to trade power. 
 Bill,  I think you are about to become my new best friend!  We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this Counterparty.)  They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  Can you help us?!!! 
 Can you help me with this?

 Clem,  Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.  Carolyn started working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!). Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB relationship for the law firm.  Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be around.  I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.  I think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.   - cpv.doc

 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.   I am not sure if we have the correct legal name of your company, so can you please verify that for me.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am forwarding to you the proposed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Pricewaterhouse (for CreditDimensions) and Enron Credit Limited.  Mark Greenberg has spoken to the counterparty and made a few changes to Pricewaterhouse's form.  If you have any questions about the transaction, the business person on the deal is Kim Detiveaux here in Houston.  Otherwise, we would appreciate your assistance in getting Richard Sage in London to execute this agreement. 
 Aparna,  For Compaq, you say approved for financial trading, but then you've got an "X" in the box.  I think you need to open them up...    Aparna Rajaram/ENRON@enronXgate 04/18/2001 01:07 PM

 Sorry about that!    With respect to the amendment to the list for 4/18/01, the approval I sent down earlier should still be good since I'm the one that figure out she said approve for financial and then had them shut down for financial. 
 We've got an Australian counterparty on the list for the 18th. 
 Legal is OK to open the above counterparty immediately for US east physical and financial power products. 
 Please let me know if you have any comments to the attached list. 
 marcus,  you've got to get this straight with Global Counterparty or you're going to have a bust on your trades. 
 Our only concerns are that we have the appropriate tax forms signed and in-house before they start trading.   If they trade U.S. products from the UK we will have to get the appropriate U.S. tax forms in, and Edmund can address any UK tax forms they might need on UK products traded from the UK. 
 I have revised the list to add a few more NDAs that have come to my attention, and then am also sending the regular Net Works NDA List as well. I hope these are helpful. 
 You are the best!    Marcus Nettelton@ENRON 04/19/2001 03:25 PM

 Would you like to set up this meeting or would you like me to?  I would like to get this Koch thing resolved ASAP, so I think the sooner, the better. From Legal's side, both Mary Cook and I need to be included, I spoke to Credit and both Walter Guidroz and Tom Moran would like to be included, probably Joe Hunter from the Confirm Desk as well, and anyone else you're aware of.  Let me know how you think we should proceed. 
 With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to follow):  Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.  LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company  SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent for three listed utilities  Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and Sam know then Sam can get them set us.  Thanks for your help! 
 I'm just going to have to call you Quick Draw McGraw!  I Can't print the lists out before I get a response from you!    Marcus Nettelton@ENRON 04/20/2001 04:08 PM

 Just a note so we are all on the same page... I just had a superseded and replaced Enron Corp. guaranty that the counterparty returned to me, and I asked Clem to verify what he wanted me to do with the old original guaranty, and he said to send it back to him and he would have Cindy mark it "canceled".

 Upon consultation with various members of the Swap Group, I am having Taffy make dinner reservations for 7:00 pm at La Fogata in San Antonio for 14 people on Wednesday night.  This is not obligatory, so if you have other dinner plans, please do not feel under any pressure to join us, just let me know.  Of course, if any one comes up with a better place, I'm open to suggestions..., but at least we'll have something! 
 Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, Doug Friedman was involved in the payment dispute that was the reason I didn't open them up for financial trading the first time they came around in January 2000.  Based on the email below, I will be opening them up on EOL to trade financial. 
 For a Netherlands incorporated counterparty wanting to do a weather option transaction, on the list you sent me earlier for the approved products for european countries, you had no options or swaptions for commodity derivatives, but nothing on weather.  What's the scoop on weather options? 
 thanks Taffy!    Taffy Milligan 04/23/2001 04:20 PM

 Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for weather transactions.  The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an ISDA Local Currency.  The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way back then.  Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online trading.  Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other currency other than U.S. $$.  If either of those issues come up, let me know. 
 You are the best!

 As an FYI, from time to time I will be preparing NDAs for the Networks team headed by Mark S. Palmer working with Travis on "Project Offline".  Project Offline has evolved a form of NDA and added a non-solicitation clause and a residuals clause.  I wanted you to be familiar with the form in case Travis is not here, you,as are my backup lawyer for the Networks team.  The form, like all my Networks forms is kept in my "Confidentiality Agreements" subdirectory under "Forms" (in case you ever need it and I'm not around). 
 Do we have any NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty? 
 Thank you for submitting your form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  However, Enron prefers to use its form of Non-Disclosure Agreement in these types of transactions.  In that regard, I am attaching our form of agreement.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 Attached for your review is a list of the NDAs we either have executed or have sent drafts to the customer.  Please take time to review this list to make sure that the status of any NDA you are interested in is correctly reflected.  Call me at x33399 with any comments or questions.

 Per the request of Lucy Ortiz, I have reviewed the current list of weather counterparties we are trading with, and have targeted four counterparties that we have open for trading weather offline that  I am now going to open for online trading.  1.  El Paso Energy Marketing Marketing Company, name change as of 12/1/99 to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company - previously approved for all products, except weather, now add approved for weather also.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement in place. 2.  Madison Gas and Electric Company - previously not approved for any financial products, now approving for all financial products.  No Master Agreement in place.  Credit, we need to pursue this financial master. 3. Swiss Re Financial Products Corp. - we previously did not approve this counterparty for any financial trading - now open for weather financial trading only.   No Master Agreement currently in place; however, we are getting close on the negotiation of this ISDA Master. 4.  Vitol N.A. - we previously had them approved for all products, but weather, open them up for weather, as well.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement in place.

 I'll be there.  I didn't sign up for the organized activities.  I'll just be hanging out.  The Swap Group is having dinner Wednesday night, if you haven't already made plans do you want to join us, we're about 15 in number right now!    Andrea Calo@ENRON 04/26/2001 01:07 PM 
 It's a date!    Andrea Calo@ENRON 04/26/2001 02:35 PM 
 We've picked up two more diners for La Fogata in San Antonio, Andrea Calo and Yao Apasu.  Can you call back the restaurant and switch our reservation to two tables of 8 people, instead of one table of 14.  I think a table of 8 will be more manageable than a table of 16.  Thanks! 
 As we discussed, attached is my "Cheat Sheet" which I use to guide me when approving non-US counterparties that come in through EnronOnline via Houston Credit.  London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties to trade online.  They also frequently deal with different countries than us.  You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.  Generally, with respect to most physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to trading.  Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial products.  Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US and UK counterparties.  With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.  As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me. 
 Yes, Mark Greenberg will pick this up.    Kay Young 04/27/2001 08:44 AM

 Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.  Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.  The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.  If you have any questions, please call. 
 Any problems with this counterparty? 
 I will pass on your "hello" to the rest of the group.  Of course we don't forget one of our favorite credit guys!

Attached is the icon, which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in the database except the legal and credit comments.  I will make a request to add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.  I think Denis O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he has edit access.  (you can just copy this link and add it to emails to people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).

Are All the other People you have requesting edit access in Legal?  On read access, Rod Nelson from Credit already has Edit access from his days in London.  You can send all those other people the Link (if it works) and they should be able to get in.  If they are in Credit we will want them to have edit access because they can read the comments so they can see more detail about the negotiation.  And hopefully, input their comments about their negotiation to keep Legal apprised (we can always hope!).    Matthew Dawson 05/09/2001 12:23 PM 
 In response to a RUSH request from Frank:  FINANCIAL TRADING:  El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. is approved to trade all financial products under with the existing El Paso Energy Marketing Company (now known as El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company) Master Agreement dated as of 04/20/95.  Such Master Agreement and the Transactions thereunder we assigned to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P, pursuant to an Assignment of Agreements dated as of 12/1/99.  Confirmation Desk:  with respect to weather confirmations, they should continue to follow the existing format of the El Paso Energy Marketing Company weather trades (changing the name, of course).  We are in the process of replacing the old "ERMS Style" Master Agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement and will notify you when the new agreement is executed.  PHYSICAL TRADING:  Approved for all products.  Global Contracts:  talk to Stacy Dickson about which contracts to use (EL Paso, Sonat or GTC).  EMERGING PRODUCTS.  Approved for all products.  POWER:  Not approved for trading.  All power trading should continue under the old El Paso Power Services Company entity until we receive documentation that evidences the approval of the assignment of their power  license.

 I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby (well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work!), I called Leslie at home at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company approved.  We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for purchases only).  No one has approved any other lists while you were out, so I have been patiently been waiting your return...sniff...sniff... 
 Can you please put this counterparty in profile manager for me.  We had a really old ERMS Master that restricted the types of financial products they could trade under it, and I want to take a look and see what we've got them approved for.  They should be able to trade any financial products now. Thanks! 
 On the ISDA replacement front, just a reminder that we want to put Morgan Stanley Capital Group at the forefront, we have an old Energy Price Swap Agreement in place with them, and then there's always our favorite, the old AIG "Master Master", now with Sempra, that raises a whole host of other issues...you were going to talk to Bill about that one...  Do you want me to put them on the list for the Legal/Credit meeting as a reminder? 
 As of this week EnronOnline has just started offering US/Canadian Dollar Swaps Online.  As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online I look at the Financial Trading Agreement Database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master swap agreement, and I am also looking at any Board Resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed.  What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions.  Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the "Restrictions" contained in Lotus Notes. 
 You are absolutely the best!    Peter Keohane 05/11/2001 02:35 PM

 Anna's information is not completed and I bet her cost center is different from yours (company the same?). 
 I've got everyone's access submitted except Martin Rosell and Anna Reich and Oliver Harrison whose company codes and cost centers I will need.  Justin, Mark Illiott, Robert Quick and Paul Simons already had edit access into the database and does your assistant Nicola Beales who should be checking that when she approves counterparties for EnronOnline (although I don't think the UK agreement are currently up-to-date, although they need to be for EnronOnline, it will save her a lot of time).  I'm a little worried about your Credit people making changes.  When you approve Credit people, warn them that they are should not make any changes except to Credit comments.  Edmund will need to go in and add your Legal and Credit people to the Database Keywords as only he should have access to add Keywords.  You might want to get him started on that because you have a lot of people to add. It's taken me quite a bit of time get all these approvals done! 
 On or about 5/2/01we opened the above counterparty to transact Canadian/US Currency Swaps on EnronOnline (which they cannot transact under the old Master Energy Price Swap Agreement, they would have to transact udner the GTC).  After discussing this counterparty w/Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the swap group, it appears that Sara has been talking to Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley does all its interest rate & currency business out of Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  We can keep Morgan Stanley Capital Group open for currency swaps, but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that company we'll know why.  Sara is already working on an ISDA Master for Capital Services for Gary Hickerson's group.

 So I don't forget when you get back, I just spoke to John Allario, and we either need to amend or draft a new NDA for General Motors to deal with some new business approaches Net Works is making with them.  We'll need to possible add in 3 other Enron companies, so when you get back give me a call and I'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this. 
 It depends on the sophistication of the counterparty.  I think Tembec is fairly sophisticated based on the resolutions from them I have already seen. For a counterparty that isn't, we have sample board resolutions we can send them, or we even prepare them for some counterparties because sometimes they can't even figure out how to fill in the blanks.    Chris Gaffney 05/17/2001 07:39 AM 
 Andrea,  I had Mark Greenberg, an attorney that works on EOL matters, review Green Mountain's form of CA and he much prefers ours.  What he suggested is that you send the counteparty back our form and say something to the effect that EnronOnline has a standard form of Confidentiality Agreement we prefer to execute our form.  If the form meets with their approval we're golden.  If they don't like it have them call me (and I'll just refer them to Mark!).  Attached is our preferred form.        Adriane Schultea/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 11:47 AM 
 An NDA for EOL, this time it would protect the counterparty so we can receive copies of their financial statements. 
 I wanted to forward you directions to my house for dinner this Saturday. Alicia left me a voicemail and also suggested you bring your friend Kimberly.  Please feel free to do so, the more, the merrier!  I hope you will be able to make it.  Everyone has responded yes, except John Hagood.

 Good letter!    Adriane Schultea/ENRON@enronXgate 05/17/2001 10:34 AM 
 We'll have to wait til Mark Greenberg gets in tomorrow.    Adriane Schultea/ENRON@enronXgate 05/17/2001 11:15 AM 
 As long as we're all talking about vacations, I'm going to get mine on the board early.  I would like to take the week of July 16-July 20 off. 
 Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been thinking about you.  Hope all is going well.    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 05/17/2001 05:33 PM 
 Please call Carol.  How about the Buffalo Grille, or is that too busy?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 05/17/2001 05:53 PM 
 How goes you choosing a date for NYMEX ACCESS training?  I faxed you the schedule.  The Houston guys are going February 4, from 10:00 - 2:00.  The earlier you reserve, the better chance you have of getting the date you want... 
 Do I need to do anything?    Tom Moran/ENRON@enronXgate 05/17/2001 04:35 PM 
 Per the attached memo from Mary Cook, an attorney in the Swap Group, and our meeting with members of Global Counterparty where we discussed problems with utilities of cities not being clearly identified, may I suggest the we rename GPP 98029, Norwich Public Utilities, something like, The City of Norwich, Connecticut?(which state?), by and through its Public Utilities Department. (The city utilities are at the bottom of the list.)  Stephanie, we will also need them to resubmit their PA.  Cheryl, we may need to confirm how we want to set this counterparty up before Stephanie send out the PA.

 Lucinda will be joining us.  I havent heard back from Holly.  Maybe you might want to give her a call too.  I'm sure she's a little stressed out right now!  Maybe you could bring my bike & helmet when you come.    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 05/18/2001 12:14 PM

 We have received the originally executed Password Application and Amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement dated as of 1/5/00.  The originals are being walked down to you. 
 Another request for the EnronOnline Team.  Any conflicts? 
 Attached is "Annex B.doc" which we use to prepare Annex B which contains the credit provisions we attach to a Confirmation when such is requested for omnibus financial confirmations.  About mid-way through the US Annex B is about 4 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit only or letters of credit and cash.  Following that is form of letter of credit.  We have an Annex B form for US counterparties and Canadian counterparties.  I have attached both.   The law in Canada currently does not favor taking cash in Canada and WE DO NOT TAKE CASH (this obviously is quite problematic for us!).  Our current advice from Canadian counsel is that Cash must be perfected in a way similar to filing a UCC.  The Canadian and US lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and I will let you know when/if this advice changes.      Karen A Cordova@EES 05/21/2001 10:00 AM 
 No problema!    Karen A Cordova@EES 05/21/2001 10:20 AM

 Can you handle this.  I have no ideal what they're talking about. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed forms of Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.

 Shouldn't these forms be placed in the atty.fms bank so all members of the swap team can get access to them... 
 Attached for execution is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the= =20 referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an = =20 Omnibus Confirmation.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  (i) Secretary'= s=20 Certificate re: Incumbency and certified copy of Enron Corp.=01,s articles = of=20 incorporation and bylaws, and (ii) Secretary's Certificate certifying=20 coverage of the Guaranty under the Policy for issuance of Guarantees.

 Attached please find the referenced list.  Some additional comments are as follows:  1.  City of Redding-no change from our previous approvals. 2.  Cajun Electric Power-no west coast power (caiso or firm).  It can only trade east coast power and Enron can only purchase from Cajun via EOL.  As usual, no European power until further notice. 
 Engage Energy Canada is an Alberta corporation.    Tom Moran/ENRON@enronXgate 05/23/2001 03:33 PM

 I was a little concerned when I got this email and I discussed it with Mark= =20 Taylor and I just want to confirm with you, that you are responsible for an= y=20 changes to resolutions for UK online corporations and we are responsible fo= r=20 US online corporations.

I need to confirm whether you= =20 have prepared any resolutions granting Lara & Arfan signing authority and i= f=20 you have I need to get copies faxed to me.

 Re: Pacific Forest Resources  Unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to the execution of the ISDA Master in 1998, we have an ISDA Master in place with this counterparty and have a copy of their Articles of Incorporation in the file, and there is no "Inc." at the end of this company's name.  If you would like me to send you a company of the company's Articles of Incorporation I will be happy to do so. 
 Attached is revised list, opening up EOG Resources, and shutting down Cajun Electric Power Cooperative.  Thanks for the catch! 
 Sure, just use me as as reference for getting a job.  Let me know when you come into town.    Zoltan Trizna <ztrizna@pol.net> 05/25/2001 11:55 AM

 Can I expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a high rating?    "Louis Fernandez Company" <louis@lfcompany.com> 05/25/2001 02:23 PM 
 Louis,  I went to fill in all that stuff, but they want to much personal information (like my address and phone number which I don't like to give out) and they won't accept the referral without it.    "Louis Fernandez Company" <louis@lfcompany.com> 05/25/2001 02:47 PM 
 No, I have not received the fully executed document yet from Steve.    Fred Philipson/ENRON@enronXgate 05/29/2001 09:14 AM 
 Sara, there is no paralegal yet working this deal.  It is an old Susan Flyn= n=20 deal and no credit has been received.  Unless you appoint a paralegal to=20 handle this I expect I will still be the paralegal that gets the snotty=20 emails and phone calls from Jen and from Rich Lassander. 
 I do not agree and I am discussing this with Justin Boyd in London before I (or Justin) responds to this Counterparty.  Joe, can you take a look at their EOL trades and see if there is any particular reason why their trades might be taking more than 24 hours to get a confirmation out?  Thanks.    Larry Joe Hunter 05/29/2001 11:26 AM 
 Justin,  Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.  I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the Atlantic.  By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you! 
 This is from Mark Taylor's presentation he gave for Mark Haedicke at the ISDA Energy Seminar in Houston earlier this year.  I know Elizabeth Sager did a presentation last month for Mark H. he gave to some power group in D.C. Also, Mark T. is currently working on one for bandwith trading for Tom Gros. 
 I don't know where we stand on reviewing the derivatives situation for the referenced counterparty, but Frank Davis with EOL just called and the counterparty is applying for a password, so he wanted to refresh his memory why we wouldn't open them up for derivatives trading.  I told him that we were just looking at their situation last week, and to give your name & # to the counterparty if they question why they can't trades derivatives.  It isn't clear to me that we're ready to change our opinion on them yet. 
 Thanks for the email.  Looks like we're not bad in getting their confirms out.  After I hear from Justin I'll give them a call, hopefully tomorrow.    Larry Joe Hunter 05/29/2001 02:09 PM 
 This counterparty is a public corporation and a political subdivision of the State of Nebraska (a governmental entity).  Sorry it took so long, I had to search the web and I just now had time.    Marcus Nettelton@ENRON 05/20/2001 12:36 PM 
 Just something I noted as I got in to approve Edison Mission.  West power was also in the queue for approval.  We had previously had them approved for all power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open them up for all power.  I thought it was OK to open them up for all power since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by you just in case...    Marcus Nettelton@ENRON 05/21/2001 05:10 PM 
 Thanks Justy, maybe you can just fax me a copy of your PA or ETA, so I can have a copy of the document when I speak to them.  My fax no. is 713/646-3490.  Thanks!    Justin Boyd/Enron@EUEnronXGate 05/30/2001 04:32 AM 
 No ISDA for Mitsui Corp.  Below is the link which should enable you view access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.

 No problem.    Stephanie Sever/ENRON@enronXgate 05/29/2001 01:20 PM 
 I told Paul Radous, the Credit guy that you had already said that these guys could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing license.  It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only. If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get evidence of their power marketing license. 
 We have received the originally executed Termination Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999, effective as of December 3, 1999 terminating certain transactions under the ISDA Master Agreement.  Copies will be distributed 
 Sorry, it was on the slow boat, in interroffice mail back from Steve, I just got it.  I'll fax a copy back to the company today and follow with an original by fedex this everning.    Fred Philipson/ENRON@enronXgate 05/30/2001 10:38 AM 
 Do we have an NDA for The Chase Manhattan Bank.  I kinda bet we do, but I kinda but we don't with respect to EnronOnline business... 
 As you requested, attached please find a copy of the referenced NDA. 
 Per our conversation, it appears that the two companies are going to merge in October?  Looking at Lotus Notes, I don't think we could pick two bigger dogs of masters to have in place.  I don't think we want either master to be the survivor master.  With Chase we have an old 1987 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement and with Morgan we have a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  Yuk, yuk.  If I had my druthers I say, LET'S START OVER.  I know it's far reaching, but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master replaced by October.  Do you think that's do-able?  Do we have a contact at Chase/Morgan we can start dealing with?  I'm going to add chase to the Legal/Credit list just as a tickler for us to get this thing rolling. 
 Why did we change the name for the Board of Municipal Utilities of Sikeston, Mo.?  That is the way the counterparty's financial statement reads as well as how the name is set up on their website?  I also spoke to their lawyer and he said that is how they transact.    Samuel Schott/ENRON@enronXgate 05/30/2001 01:48 PM 
 Steve,  I am Mark's paralegal.  Why don't you go ahead and fax that agreement to me at (713) 646-3490 and it will get the agreement signed and faxed it back to you.  What is your fax number?    Steve Howarth <steve.howarth@bea.com> 05/30/2001 06:34 PM

 Whilst speaking to Koch about the Koch Hydrocarbons/Industries trades, they asked if they could get ISDA Masters in place with two other Koch entities we are currently trading with.  The two companies are:  Koch Petroleum Group L.P., Credit Contact at Koch is Arnold Lenz at (316) 828-8479  Koch Refining International Pte Ltd. a Singapore company, Credit Contact is in Singapore and can be reached at  65 835 20 27 (I don't know if Houston Credit or London Credit wants to handle this, I looked in the Master Swap Agreement database and I noticed that London sent them a draft in 1999).  The Legal contact at Koch is in my database.  It is a paralegal there, Pam Reinking at (316) 828-4783.

 Does this apply to us too?

 I can't believe you are approving this!  I was just about to give you a call to ask you about the status.  What a coincidence! 
 I am going to need his address since the front of the ISDA is a pre-printed form and I can't email it.    Edward Sacks/ENRON@enronXgate 06/01/2001 04:20 PM 
 Debbie Brackett and I met this week and reviewed the various Koch Hydrocarbon Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the division issue with respect to this counterparty:  The following entities exist in GCP:  1.  Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680):  We would like this entity to remain OPEN and to be renamed "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division". 2.  Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853):  We would like all future trading with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appears to be one trade under this entity and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680. 3.  Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197):  We would like all future trading with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appear to be no trades under this entity.  With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries, Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  I will let you all know when such side letter agreement has been executed.  As soon as GCP #36680 has been renamed we can re-submit them to EnronOnline and open them up for trading. 
 I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the "Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.  That approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you know.  You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory with Mike Neves.  Let me know when you can get in. 
 Attached please find referenced list.  No european power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 Does this work for you?  Is this where you want us to send copies of our signed documents and original guarantees? 
 Any NDAs for referenced company? 
 OK by me.    Lisa Lees/ENRON@enronXgate 06/04/2001 03:05 PM 
 This looks OK to me.  Can we please change the subject to read:  PLEASE REA= D 
 OK for me. 
 No, I don't ever believe we got this executed.  Maybe we need to chat...    Leslie Hansen 06/05/2001 11:06 AM 
 I don't think it should go on the list so traders don't make a mistake and trade under it.  Is that what you usually do Susan?    Tanya Rohauer/ENRON@enronXgate 06/05/2001 11:25 AM 
 All three of your access has been approved.  Now you just have to figure out how to get into the system. 
 Any NDAs for the referenced company.  As usual, it's for EOL business...

 Company policy (and corporate organizational documents) dictates that ALL= =20 contracts may only be executed by an officer at the Vice President level or= =20 above.  I checked the Corporate Secretary's Records and they indicate that= =20 neither Beth Perlman nor Richard Burchfield meet such requirements for Enro= n=20 Net Works.

 A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up counterparties under division or trade names.  If the counterparties insist on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of the counterparty's name in GCP.   For non-swap team members, you may want to forward this email on to your groups as well. 
 Nope. 
 I have a call into the EOL team about this one.  I've tried to approve but no products will come into the queue.    Mary Griff Gray/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 09:43 AM 
 Beth Perlman, who IS a VP of Enron Corp.    Bob Ward/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 01:52 PM 
 One note.  We are currently negotiating some credit amendments to this=20 agreement. 
 My emphasis on IS was just that she IS a VP of Enron Corp., not Enron Net= =20 Works (which we found out yesterday she was not an officer of). 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching my list of North America "utility" counterparties.  My given task when I compiled this list was to identify "utilities" and determine if there was a reason we should not approve online trading for the counterparty.  We originally denied approval for all utilities unless we had a Master Agreement in place or an overriding commercial reason to transact.  We are now taking the position that investor owned utilities (IOUs) and related corporate entities should be approved for trading.  However, we will not approve online trading for governmentals or cooperatives when we do not have a master in place, so those counterparties identified as such do not need to be included in your review.  Obviously, if you are aware of a municipal or cooperative I failed to detect, please let us know.  In addition, your review does not need to extend to the Canadian counterparties.  We will run those by Canadian counsel.  Please review the list to help us identify the IOUs.  You may ignore the "Approved for Trading" column.  For your information, the list was compiled from information provided from our Credit Department, from the Company's financial statements which I obtained from EDGAR, from the Company's web site, from www.utilityconnection.com, or from web searches of the Company when I could not locate  information from any of the other sources.  Please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly. 
 You should have read access to our Financial Trading Agreements database=20 which should allow you (since you are in legal and can view the confidentia= l=20 comments section) access to the comments.  We are reducing counterparty's= =20 threshold.  Take a look, and see if you can see comments now. 
 Yes, call Mike Neves at x33363. 
 No, I think this one is for you... 
 Per our earlier discussions, I am attaching the language we would like added to the definition of Index in the long descriptions for all US physical and financial pulp, paper and lumber products.  If you have any questions, please give Mark or me a call.    Justin, as an FYI, is this something you might want to add to your European products as well? 
 Per our meeting, we need you to (i) check whether you had "Total Premium" or "Premium" in your online confirmation, and (ii) give me some language re: online trading procedures for the confirmation procedures section.  Thanks! 
 Anthony,  Unless your questions relate to an online problem, can you address your master questions to either of the two Susans.  Thanks! 
 At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our form of EnronOnline Password Application, Electronic Trading Agreement, and a sample of each of a financial and physical online GTC. 
 We received a Notice from the NYMEX today that they have set March 2 as the date for power to go ex-pit.  I will send each of you a copy of the memo. Copies are also being immediately hand delivered to Jim Fallon and Tim Belden. 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  This Guaranty will supersede and replace the guaranty previously given to Counterparty (formerly known as Enserch Energy Services, Inc.) dated as of December 16, 1996.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 Checking your mail, a Confidentiality  Agreement came in from Greg Bruch, I gave him a call to see what his timing was, he said ite wasn't urgent, but if we could get an attorney looking at it, to get it final maybe next week.  It is counterparty's form, they would be the disclosing party, for a potential fiber source deal.  I am going to pass the agreement on to Carol for review, and will leave you a copy. 
 Attached please find referenced list,   Again, no physical power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 Why won't they let you go to the Corp. conference?  It's too bad, this new resort across the was from the Hyatt Hill Country where we stayed that last time it supposed to be even nicer.  Bummer!  It appears the ECT one is probably always going to be at the Woodlands Resort, which is real boring... 
 FYI 
 Can whoever is working on the revised confirms for the referenced counterparty let Doug know the status?  Thanks! 
 When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have fixes/upgrades we need to the database.  In particular, the EOL people are about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.  When you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that sort working.  Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we need to make.  Much thanks! 
 Attached please find referenced list.  No european power products approved until further notice. 
 Below are the people I would like to have access to this database:  Me Mark Taylor Leslie Hansen Elizabeth Sager Alan Aronowitz Harry Collins Stacy Dickson Jeff Hodge David Portz Molly Harris Tom Moran Edmund Cooper in London Justin Boyd in London  Thanks! 
 Working late, huh!?! 
 Why did you send this credit worksheet to me for a physical deal? 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  Of course, no European power approved for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 Am I supposed to do anything with this new counterparty, or wait until you add it to tomorrow's list? 
 San Diego has applied for a Password Application and wants to trade financial.  Per them, they have already been trading financial off-line with us, and I check with the Confirm Desk and that statement is true, Craig Breslau has done financial trades with them (I thought they weren't allowed to trade financial?!).  Anyway, can we now open them up to trade financial? 
 Do any of the other trading groups have any masters in place with Transammonia, Inc. or any of its divisions, such as Trammochem, Trammo Gas or TrammoGas & Petrochemicals?  Can you let me know ASAP.  Thanks! 
 I am meeting with the exterminator tomorrow a.m.  He said he would arrive between 8-9 am, if he shows up more toward 9 I might not be back yet, if he shows up more towards 8, 10:00 will probably be fine. 
 Attached is the list for 1/24/00.  For the list dated 1/25/00 which only had one amended counterparty, First Energy Corp., I have a change in my earlier approval, from the Power Group. I don't have a code for this, so I'll just tell you, for this Counterparty Enron call SELL power only to them pursuant to an on-line GTC.  This Counterparty cannot sell to us via EOL. 
 It appears that you are signed up for this class, and the confirmation and approval should go to you & Scott.  Remember that you will be charged if you do not cancel if you are not going to go (and the charge for canceling is pretty high, about $1000.  There is no charge if you attend.  Also, let me know if you don't get the proper approval forms. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Again, no european power products for US counterparties until further notice.  Also, Renaissance is an Amended approval, so I just wrote in the corner-amended-no change, since I have no change in the  earlier approvals I told you. 
 Don't feel left out, but you're the only person I haven't heard from... 
 I said that Contract Administration couldn't determine by looking at the database whether there was one and you said you would look at the database, that you might be able to tell. 
 We have received the executed Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and the referenced Counterparty dated January 13, 2000.  This Amendment amends the Threshold levels in the Credit Support Annex.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have no record of such an ISDA Master or any other financial master being in place with this counterparty.  Could it be drugs?!! 
 I hope you know I was joking with you...I was a little hesitant about sending that message... 
 I'm glad to hear from you!  I guess I'm a little confused.  I thought you were going to send me your form.  I would be happy to send ours.  I can draft one up in a jiffy.  Just let me know what you prefer.  P.S.  Isn't email wonderful! 
 The Lower Colorado River Authority has called and is ready to do financial business with us and wants to get a revised draft of the ISDA.  The credit on the draft I sent them before is quite old, so I need someone to get me new credit or tell me if the old credit is still ok.  Respectfully, 
 We are going to open San Diego Gas & Electric to transact the following financial products, but are going to limit the length of the trades to 3 months or less.  The approved products per the Master Agreement are any "swap, cap, floor, collar or option...based on the prices of crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or electric power...".  I have previously not distributed the executed Master Agreement because of unresolved issues with the counterparty, but will send copies today to the usual distribution.  We have an executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement in place between ECT and the counterparty dated as of February 25, 1997.  All financial trades for this counterparty should go under the master. 
 Gracie,  Thanks for your help! 
 FINANCIAL:  We have an ISDA Master in place, originally through Transammonia, Inc., acting through its division Trammochem.  That master has since been expanded to allow trading through additional divisions, Trammo Gas Division and Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division.  All trades and confirms can be done as follows:  Transammonia, Inc. Transammonia, Inc. acting though its division Trammochem Transammonia Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division Transammonia Inc., acting through its Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division  Obviously, Transammonia, Inc., the body corporate, needs to always be on the confirm.  PHYSICAL:  My reports from the other Legal trading groups are that they have no contracts in place, although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side as to whether Global Contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master in place. 
 Mark just had to run down quick to a meeting.  When he gets out we'll give you a call & go over this stuff.  We really appreciate your help! 
 If you are in Houston on Feb 10 and HAVE NOT PLANNED ON HAVING DINNER WITH ME, then just don't plan on coming.  I mean, after your last lame excuse about that hotel by the airport, I'm gonna take it real personal if the only hotel room you can get this time is in Pearland.  Ya know what I mean...  Anyway, I have been thinking about you and wondering what you're up to.  For the Enron Corp. Legal Conference, real cool people (like me) are signing up for the raft trip, so as long as the weather's nice we're going to be floating down the Guadalupe drinking some brews.  So if you were cool you'd be hanging out with the cool group (like me)...what are your plans?!! 
 Attached please find referenced list.  Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice. 
 Please be advised that the NYMEX ACCESS training session will be held from 10:00 am - 2:00 pm at the DoubleTree Hotel in the Allen Center. 
 Usually y'all let me know who's working on the Credit and when I can expect some, but since I didn't hear back I thought that y'all just forgot about me since I'm not on the day to day stuff...there is no particular urgency, next week is fine... 
 Per your request, attached is our sample ISDA Schedule for a plain U.S. corporate entity. 
 I feel better already...sniff...sniff... 
 Attached please find referenced list.  As usual, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 Nella,  Your message about the Canadian forms inspired me to visit with Mark.  We were in the middle of updating the Canadian forms, and Mark just gave me a few final changes, and as soon as I make those I'll email them up to you. Actually we have two Canadian forms, the ISDA and the "Industrial". 
 I just got some late changes in from Leslie, so please hold list I JUST send you until she resolves these issues.  Thanks! 
 Here is my revised list incorporating Leslie Hansen's power comments. 
 Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that make sens? 
 I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall "system" still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the database to all interested ENA employees.  I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of. First is our" jurisdictional database", which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon.  Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.  The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem.  The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system.  Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this. 
 It's a date!  Would you like me to make reservations at someplace nice, or just go casual? 
 FYI,  Today is the date for renewal of the Consent of Service of Process in connection with the ISDA Master Agreement in place with the referenced counterparty.  I have faxed Mr. Blaquier a request to provide me with evidence of such renewal.  I will keep you apprised. 
 My fax won't go through, I appear to have a bad number.  Can one of you provide me with a new fax & phone numbe ror contact Mr. Blaquier.  Thanks! 
 Debra is the paralegal for the physical gas trading group. 
 The fax still can't seem to go through.  Do I have too mane 2's in the fax #?  Do I need to add a 1 to dial out of the U.S.? 
 What's the scoop, can't come up with ten Top 10's?!!  I never thought I'd see the day... 
 You've received the whole thing.  Mark T. likes to ad lib a lot when he gives a presentation. 
 This came up at our Group meeting today, did you ever sign that Master Netting Agreement for Petro-Canada at year end? 
 new person taking over for Bob Shults 
 Attached please find referenced lists.  Again, now European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 Bob Klein from Salomon Smith Barney would like to arrange a conf. call tomorrow at 11:00 am.  I checked your calendar and you look clear so I told him that was OK and that we would call him. 
 I have been faxed a proposed form of assignment from El Paso with respect to certain trades transacted between 1/14 and 1/25 which they would like assigned to their affiliate, El Paso Energy Marketing Canada Inc.  I am having a messenger walk a copy down to each of you and need your direction as to whether we should consent to this assignment. 
 I have had to revise the list I provided to you earlier.  The change was shutting Kimball down for financial as well. 
 Shari, how do you want to handle this? 
 I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and hasn't heard from them.  I asked him to refax the renewal notice to them.  He said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got some time to resolve this.  I'll keep you posted. 
 Thanks for your email.  I don't want to state the obvious because you appear to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from trading in anything the company trades in.  Any trading you do for your own account must comply with this policy. 
 I do not appear to be having a winning record for getting my approval list right the first time today.  Attached is also a revised list for 01/31/00. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa... 
 Can you make a note in Lotus Notes reflecting your conversation.  Thanks! 
 FYI, about the Canadian master netting agreements. 
 Attached please find referenced list.  Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.  On Sithe Power where we only changed the counterparty id #, there is no change from my previous approval. 
 I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty.  It's not surprising, it's a confusing master!  This is currently the only agreement we have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial transactions in one agreement.  There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (Global Contract Reference No. 96000160).  This agreement provides for financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.  It does not provide for any other physical products.  Call me if you have any questions... 
 Just a reminder to talk to me Monday about the utilities.  I was not aware we were not currently trading financial power, which they are getting ready to open up.  I figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot trade.  So, I've go to start opening up my utilities... 
 Marie was just telling me about your rough tour of duty in the French Alps next week.  I speak a little high school French...perhaps you might need some assistance while you are there...?! 
 How do they override letters go out?  Do you tell someone, do I need to? 
 Can you please shut this counterparty down for weather.  Thanks! 
 Fyi.  However, we need 7 file drawer files.  What do you think. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  On the amended counterparties, Southwestern Public Service Company is the only one with a change, with Enron sells power only, and on the only new counterparty, Minnesota Power, we've got Enron selling power only also.  Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 I thought Bob's email was cute.  I asked him to get me our deals numbers for the El Paso assignment, and he sent me the following... 
 Marie and I had a giggle over your email! 
 Who's Dana? 
 Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web sites:  www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records)  www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety, repair records)  www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test results" they have some info on SUV crash tests.  Since y'all don't have as many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident).  Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety... 
 You narratives aren't too long, I'm just giving you some grief! 
 I have created a database for the Legal Dept., somewhat similar to how the master swap agreement database works, for us to keep track of our approvals for EOL trading, as well as any executed amendments to the EOL Password Application, ETA, GTC, or any other EOL documents.  I have been inputting the data for the Houston based Credit counterparties, and was wondering whether you want me to input the London based Credit counterparties or not.  I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it for you.  Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you have an assistant do that.  Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very helpful).  It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty). Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at it just to see what I'm doing.  We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not fully operational yet.  Anyway, give me your thoughts...Don't make any changes, it'll screw things up... 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  As usual, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further ntocie. 
 Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated....! 
 As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your attention.  One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms. The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.  We need to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms evolve without  approval.  Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation change, if you make it in every agreement.  Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical component of the Fishkin Project).  Thanks for your attention to this. 
 Would you like to set up a time to chat?  My calendar is pretty clear this week, except for tomorrow at 2:00 pm. 
 We wish you the best for your vacation!  I hope the rest of the Credit Group maintains the high standard of diligence and promptness that you have established. 
 I haven't heard back from you about my EOL database.  I will hope that your lack of response means that you are busy, not in disapproval of my lovely database... 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  We have no changes to the amended counterparties, so the only counterparty really with a comment is Westcoast Energy, which we have not approved for power.  Of course, no European power for US entities until further notice. 
 My Apartment:  1.  Fix leg on sunroom denim couch 2.  Fix front of dresser drawer in back bedroom that is falling off 3.  Front door - handle is loose 4.  The window in the back bedroom behind the bed is missing trim.  I think the trim is in the closet in the living room.  The blinds won't be right if we don't get that trim in.  Downstairs Apartment:  1.  Fix broken window in front bedroom 2.  In bathroom, piece of wood has fallen off cabinet 3.  In bathroom, towel rack is broken.  Can you replace? 4.  Peter says ice cube maker won't shut water off when is on, so he just had it off 5.  Nancy said front door handle is loose 6.  Do we have any drips in sinks?  The floor refinishers will show up Monday morning.  They are going to refinish downstairs floors and my back stairwell.  I would like to recarpet upstairs.  Where do you suggest I go to get new carpeting? 
 Two emails and still no response...was it something I said?! 
 Can you change it on my calendar.  Thanks! 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  Since all the counterparties are amended counterparties, my changes are as follows:  1.  Statoil - no change in earlier approvals  2.  Texla -  I don't think it's a change, but they cannot trade US power, also there is no change for financial, I previously said and we continue not to trade financial.  3.  Avista Corporation- Washington Water Power Division.  For financial trading for Avista Corporation I previously said no financial trading.  I am going to open them up for all financial trading.  They can trade under the Avista Corporation name, or they can trade as Avista Corporation, acting through its Washington Water Power Division.   For power trading,  they can trade all US West power products, but can Enron can only sell to Avista for US East power products.  Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice. 
 Just a reminder to talk to Tim Belden... 
 You are the woman! 
 I have not heard back from DAPSA with respect to the Consent to Service of Process.  Can your business contact there give them a call?  Thanks. 
 Per my conversations with John Suttle in Credit, I am opening up the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products. 
 Just a reminder...to talk to Tim Belden.... 
 Why do we have two active masters?!  Because it appears that Synder/Santa Fe merged and Susan B. did not handle to multiple master issue! 
 In looking through Lotus Notes for EOL, it appears we have two active masters for Santa Fe Snyder Corporation.  Does anyone know which one is the active master? 
 The master agreement for this counterparty appears to not cover the Trade Option Exemption.  Are we adding that into confirms? 
 When would you like to discuss utilities...? 
 I went through our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and determined that the following masters do not permit power:  The Bakersfield Californian    newprint only Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG   no commodity transactions CGAS, Inc.      natural gas only (are currently shut down for trading because authority certificate only covered one trade) Coastal Gas Marketing Company   natural gas transactions only Credit Lyonnais New York Branch (AAA Program) no commodity transactions E.W. Scripps Company (The)    48.8 gram newsprint swaps only Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc.   no commodity transactions.  Weather is ok Mellon Bank NA     FX and currency option transactions only Midland Bank plc     FX and currency option transactions only National Westminster Bank    FX and currency option transactions only Palladium Insurance Limited    weather only Phibro, Inc.      energy price swaps based on fixed and floating prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products and/or call        and put options based on the prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products  Praxair, Inc.      natural gas only PXRE Corporation     weather only St. Paul Re (Bermuda) Ltd.    weather only Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited  weather only Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale  FX and currency option transactions only 
 TAKE A VACATION DAY! 
 Please find attached the referenced list.  For Enserco Energy, Inc., my previous approvals remain the same except for power, which has been shut down for trading (I can't just copy the last excel spreadsheet since the columns are not in the same order anymore).  Then, the only other new counterparty is also shut down for power but open for everything else. 
 We need to amend the master on Williams, and Mark asked me to see you about it because this type of amendment might have to be made to a number of counterparty masters.  When you have some time, can I come around...Thanks... 
 I will attend. 
 I have received executed copies of the following assignments of certain EOL trades (physical and financial):  1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Houston Pipe Line Company  2.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignee") and Enron North America Corp.  3.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Canada Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Enron North America Corp.  Copies of these assignments will be sent to the usual distribution group. 
 The EOL trade assignment letters are prepared off the same form we do our regular assignments.  There is no special language in the assignment form about online issues. 
 Attached are the Swap Group's form of Enron Corp. and Counterparty guarantees.  Erica, these forms are located at atty.fms/swaps/current forms/guaranty.doc. 
 I'm ready for a real challenge...!  It is always my pleasure to help you and Babs! 
 What the latest with Force?  Should we proceed with this amendment... 
 I have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of May 25, 1999.  This amendment deletes the prior Confidentiality provision in the ISDA Master Agreement and replaces it with our current Confidentiality language.  This change will allow either party to provide copies of the agreement to its Affiliates.  Copies will be distributed. 
 With this attitude, you are sure to work up in the standings of being our favorite Credit person... 
 The referenced counterparty is approved to trade all products except power. 
 I do believe you can look up who is working on this master in Lotus Notes... 
 Greg, check with Nella or Peter.  The ISDA 1994 Credit Support Annex should be contained in the binder I gave Peter during his secondment here in Houston. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 15, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be distributed in the usual manner. 
 And you just know I just hate to be right...! 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note the following:  1.  For Puget Sound, no change in our earlier approvals except for power. For power, open for West products, but ENRON SALES only for East products.  2.  For Ferrell International Limited, Credit shows them as an amended CP, but I have no record of seeing them before, so I treated them as a new CP.  Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 8, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty. Copies will be distributed in the usual manner 
 I spoke to Mark Taylor today and he said that he spoke this week with a lawyer from, I believe Skadden, that had been hired by the OMLX to talk to ED&F Mann about the CFTC issue.  I think Mark Taylor is waiting to hear back from the Skadden lawyer. 
 We have received the executed  Letter Agreement dated January 25, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with respect to the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be distributed in the usual manner. 
 We have received fully executed copies of the following assignments of physical natural gas transactions:  1.  Assignment of Various Natural Gas Transactions by and between El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and Enron North America Corp.  2.  Assignment of Various Natural Gas Transactions by and between El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and Enron Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Thanks for following up with this!  It is critical we have accurate information on our positions.  Continually busting our limits could subject the company to potentially substantial fines from the NYMEX.  Please let me know what Mike's thoughts are... 
 Oh, you little sweet talker...! 
 No, I didn't get it.  Just reply back to this email & reattach it. 
 Can we do a "See" dropdown like the Master Swap Agreement Database, so we can track name changes?  Thanks! 
 As a follow-up to our conversation, the referenced counterparty is not an eligible swap participant, therefore we need to shut them down for all financial. 
 What do you think about the situation below? 
 The Legal/Credit Meeting scheduled for today is canceled due to the absence of Susan Flynn. 
 Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  On Encal, the only amended counterparty, I don't know if this is a change or not from the prior approval, but Leslie shut them down for power.  All other prior approvals for that counterparty should remain the same. 
 Let me know what you think...I may go do my "long" run on Sunday, if you're doing one too, maybe we can meet for breakfast... 
 What are your thoughts on this... 
 Is this trade something you know something about? 
 I spoke to Mike Mulligan at Paribas and he said he had discussed this trade with Lee.  I don't know if you need any help from me expediting this amendment to the guaranty, let me know if you do.  Mike's number is in our Master Swap Agreement database. 
 Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments:  1.  BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me.  We got the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all financial. 2.  Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America.  That should be the name that goes out on the confirm.  All the counterparties on today's list are shut down for power. 
 Attached is the Enron Employee Referral Form and resume of my friend Patty Young, which I will be submitting to two groups for consideration.  Please let me know if anything else is needed. 
 I don't understand what it is I haven't completed.  Can you let me know so I can complete the form.  Thanks! 
 I'll pass on any other articles on the transportation industry that might be in our various derivatives magazines .  Glad you liked this one! 
 What if there is no specific job.  I spoke to Mary Solmonson in Global Contracts and she said they had several job offerings and to send the resume to her and she would take a look at it and forward it to the relevant groups? 
 EOL needs to hear ASAP whether Nicor Gas Company is approved to trade online...can you let me know...thanks! 
 Attached is the referenced approval list. 
 Attached is the revised Referral Form and Resume for Patty Young.  I hope this does it! 
 Tonight I'm going to see a house after work today and then I have a late Sergei workout.  But keep me in mind in the future...  I finally got your application accepted by our personnel group, so now I can forward it to the respective groups for review.  One of the bad things about big corporations are the forms you have to fill out to do anything... 
 That was funny! 
 We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement (which supersedes and replaces the Master Agreement [ECT] executed 1/30/97, dated as of 10/19/95):  Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:  10/19/95  Executed Date:  02/09/00  Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:  TXU Energy Trading Company  Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX  Confirm Desk:    As previously noted, we have agreed to a special form of confirmation acceptance letter 
 FYI, attached is the Confirm Desk's latest list of confirms requiring special provisions. 
 At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, since it's not such a large amount of money.  Sara Shackleton is heading down there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to give you a head's up about our thinking on this. 
 Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.  We had a nice lunch at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my house for a chat.  Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient. Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life.  I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night and we're all a bit excited about that.  Then Thursday night is our big night out at a blues club.  This email was a good idea.  Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting with her more than every two years!  I'll be in touch when I get back.   All my love, 
 We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) executed 04/08/99, effective as of 06/09/98.  Copies will be distributed.  We also received the originally executed Confirmation, Deal # EM3927.1,2 & 3.  I will sent it down to the Confirmation Desk. 
 Dear Mr. Zunic,  Pursuant to the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am attaching a sample form of our Master Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529 if you have any comments or questions. 
 With respect to the referenced lists, all the counterparties on these lists are amended counterparties and there are no changes to our earlier approvals.  FYI, Credit did not have Ionic Energy down as an amended counterparty, but per my conversation with Tom Moran, it was on the initial second list, and should be treated as an amended counterparty. 
 Below is the new drop down I need added:  Trade Option Representation (choose one only):  standard weather included enron must be offeree none other  Mike, the above should have a box to check, and the box should always check "standard" unless someone goes in and effectively changes it.  Then add the following:  Other trading provisions  pulp & paper FRABBA  Switching databases to the EnronOnline database:  We need to add a category for a new product, Credit Derivatives, have a comment box just like financial or power, have it follow after power. 
 This will confirm our conversation today regarding which European jurisdictions are approved for trading credit derivatives:  the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Finland and Switzerland.  The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.  Per our conversation, Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.  Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  I haven't said it for a few lists, but remember, no European power for US counterparties until further notice... 
 Greg,  It appears we send Dynegy Canada a draft ISDA in July of 1999, and got no response from them.  We will need to update the ISDA we sent them in July since our form has changed since then.  Once we get the go ahead from John Suttle in Credit as to whether we need to update the credit, we will prepare the ISDA Master Agreement you have requested. 
 My pleasure...! 
 There are no changes from my previous approvals for the two counterparties on this list. 
 No, they never gave me an updated copy. 
 It appears this class is on a Sunday & a Monday.  Did I get this right? 
 Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States Power Companies.  We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).  The counterparty that showed up on yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation (cpy ID #161).  The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota corporation.  I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals... 
 Robin Newman Matthew Bender & Co. 212/448-2168 
 With the execution of the Wisconsin Gas Company master, this brings the total executed financial masters to 400.  The countdown to 500 executed financial masters is now starting!  Congratulations to the Legal and Credit teams for getting us to this point and for a job well done! 
 Leslie,  Why am I getting this information below?  These counterparties are not on my approval lists for the last few days.  Did Frank ask you questions re: the counterparties below, and you just want me to put this info in the EOL Legal Database? 
 With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with, do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" equivalant rules? 
 Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think Mark was going to talk to you about it.  Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.  He feels he is having to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.  Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.  His phone # is 713/331-5049.  FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:  Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.  Even though Peoples Gas is a division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing license was not granted in that name.  Further, I earlier shut down Tampa Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas. 
 I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.  As we discussed, Dynegy Canada is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done with ECC.  Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA. Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in place with either ECC or ENA.  Works for me...! 
 Brenda Whitehead prepared that presentation and should be sending it to you. 
 I would be more than happy to update the database with any comments you may want me to add, don't ever feel bad, when I don't expect something I just need to know what it's about.  I hope we can open the EOL Legal Database soon so you can update any comments or notes directly into it. 
 In response to your email:  1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade online.  2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.  3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process should continue to be done through the Legal Department. 
 Below are the account numbers at Salomon Smith Barney that you will need to trade NYMEX ACCESS power:  PJM  017 90327 CIN  017 90316 ENT  017 90317 PV  017 90404 COB  017 90405  For those of you who haven't done business with Salomon Smith Barney before, our trader contact there is John Galperin at (212) 723-7284. 
 Per the request of Mark Taylor, I am forwarding the attached. 
 Attached is the list of the counterparties that EOL wants to approve for emissions auction trading.  Please let me know ASAP if there are any counterparties on this list that should not be allowed to trade emissions auctions. 
 Per the note below from Brent, I am going to inactivate this master.  Also, per his note, it appears you should make a note to review the credit prior to approving any future trades. 
 Gracie,  My confirmation of the class showed the 8/8 and 8/9.  You may want to go in and check your schedule. 
 I had Calpine Power Services Company shut down for financial, and we got the master in signed, so I am going to open them up.  Can you add them to tomorrow's list.  Thanks! 
 I don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit derivatives, but attached is the list EOL sent me.  Many of the counterparties on the list are London based credit counterparties, and I will not be reviewing those, but I thought you might want to take a look at this to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at.  When I'm done (probably some time at end of the day since I just got the list yesterday and it's due today!), I will be emailing my approvals to Mark Dilworth in London. 
 Just a reminder to send me a memo asking me to delete Bob Shultz as and EOL signatory and add Sheri Thomas in his place.  Much thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated to reflect this change.  European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..  The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.  Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.  Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. 
 To confirm our conversation, can you add "Credit Derivatives" as a new products to my database.  We will need the same drop downs as the other produsts (gas trading, financial trading, etc.).  Thanks! 
 I am aware that you need a list from me, I am working on it right now.  I just got the list from EOL yesterday and I'm reviewing it as fast as I can. My goal is to get it done by the end of my workday, so you should have it when you arrive in the morning. 
 There should be no question of duplication of ISDA Master Agreement or any other master swap agreements between Houston and London, because Houston's contracting party is usually Enron North America Corp. and London's contracting party is usually Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  We cannot do business under each others' financial master agreements for legal and tax reasons.  ENA and Enron Canada Corp. can do business under each other's masters because the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went away.  Further, Houston and Canada subsequently entered into a Services Agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each other's behalf (necessary for tax and legal reasons). 
 Below is the list of the final work we need you to bid on for the downstairs apartment:  1.  Paint inside of bathroom cabinets 2.  Paint outside and inside of kitchen cabinets 3.  Fix bottom of drawer of kitchen cabinet located right of dishwasher 4.  Replace closet rod in front bedroom to match other closet's rod 5.  Hammer down shelf ends that are loose in closet in back bedroom 6.  Clean ends of door hardware that have drips on them. 7.  Rehang blinds (we'll have to buy new hardware for existing blinds and then I will have to buy new blinds if any were bent by the kids)  Did I catch everything?

 We have some files in an empty cubicle that kinda look like global contract files.  They have global contract sheets and numbers attached to the front of the documents in the files.  If they belong to anyone in your group they need to be claimed now, because we are doing a cubicle restructuring this weekend and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of.  Can you have someone come 
 Mark says I need to talk to you about the Credit Derivatives confirmation process... 
 Please add TXU Energy Trading Company to list.  We had an old style "ERMS" master in place, so they weren't allowed to do power, but now we have an ISDA in place (even tho' Brant Reves threw out the new guaranty, but that is another story!), so I am going to open them up for weather. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I am responsible for those counterparties originating from Houston Credit.  Edmund Cooper is responsible for the UK Credit based counterparties.  I am still resolving issues on about 8-10 counterparties.  If something doesn't make sense, let me know. 
 Can you let me know what the scoop is on those countries and I will update my memo.  Thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following countries to the non-approved list:  Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.  Below is the list, now updated to reflect this change.  Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..  Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches). This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.  Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. 
 You are the best! 
 Why does it always have to be my deals...?!!! 
 We've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX  Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.  The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.  It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend.  Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation... 
 We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add the rep into every confirm.  BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, and this has caused much difficulties.  I am going to count it as signed, since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.  Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me.  Much thanks. 
 We have received the executed  Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000.  This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Updating another blue file because Susan B., this time, has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes! 
 It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.  I didn't either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.  When you have a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel. 
 I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.  I communicated that to Bob Bowen.  He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business.  Wow! 
 Carol, will you handle this or Mark? 
 We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999.  This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities Act representation to the master.  Copies will be distributed.  Confirmation Desk:  you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now. 
 Here's the list with the missing counterparties. 
 Yeah! 
 Probably... 
 I just got a call from Dave and Frank and they tell me I have a whole week this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade Australian financial power.  I'll need to talk to you about his Monday. 
 Hey guys, take Monday off! 
 ISDA has published the referenced supplement.  Among other changes, the supplement adds hundreds of new gas, liquids and power price sources.  Copies will be distributed to you. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Some comments:  We got a master financial agreement in place with Calpine Power Services  Company so it has been opened up to trade all financial.  Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master" with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial products as well.  For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under what  names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email about this about a month to two months ago).  That letter had the counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its  Trammo Gas Division".  I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that name.   Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions... 
 David,  I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.  I am the lead contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group (financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and Credit teams.  I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).   Have your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?  Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) with respect to a trade?  Thanks for your help! 
 I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we always seem to need more time. 
 Sheri,  I need the trade date so I know what to date the termination. 
 I sent the documents to Paul Davis on March 6. 
 Actually, bluebonnets bloom for a short time, maybe three week early in the Houston Spring, in March, after heavy Spring rains have gone on for a bit, and when the temperature is in the 60's to 70's.  They would get fried and fade in the heat of a Houston summer.  However, I don't know the temperatures and rain condition of your summers, and what time of your year would replicate those conditions. 
 Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland, "Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc." is a bad name.  The correct legal name for this counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement database:  "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division".  I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters (713/544-5938, ext. 5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password Application with the name corrected.  Please show this correction in your records as well. 
 Please take me off your distribution.  I already bought my new car.  Thank youl. 
 I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and provisions.  Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that? 
 Did you forget something in your email? 
 Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.  1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian financial power.  2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading? Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not approve the London based counterparties.  3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.  FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by London when they arrive for work Friday morning. 
 As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty list.  Thinking through this product today and reading through my various emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved financial power product.  I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?  The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have been issued passwords). 
 Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the messenger)...  With respect to your form of online GTC:  It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty (a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with Enron Australia.  In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online "Deemed ISDA" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation).  As you can see when you look at our "Deemed ISDA" form of confirmation, there are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation includes, such as authority and tax representations, "arm's length transaction" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting "in respect of the same transaction"), no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, definition of "Transaction" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, "Website" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we usually say "Loss" instead of "Market Quotation", also,  Market Quotation and Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we need the word "integrated" with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a "single agreement" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our "severability" and "setoff" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, business day defined as Sydney only, etc.  Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in place.  I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.  After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help resolving all these issues... 
 Debbie,  Thanks for the heads up on this.  I've been trying to get David Minns for several days about various issues.  Keep me posted. 
 I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara. Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing contractual documents without Legal's initials.  There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us: (1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.  Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more after lunch.  On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.  Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on too.  Are you also working on this?  So that's what's going on... 
 Per an earlier conveersation with Dave, ee weren't quite sure if you have seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online, so I am sending you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the products we offer, as well as the Enron entity that a counterparty would enter into the trade with. 
 Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.  David Minns will have to get back to us about all the other products!  For the current U.S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for "US Power Financial Swaps".  I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine. 
 Thanks for returning my message.  I had an Australian issue come up and anyone who was familiar with Australian law was unreachable and I was in an absolute panic.  But as things usually do, this problem worked itself out too!  As usual, I am always humbly in your debt... 
 I have developed a database in which I keep track of the counterparties Legal has approved, any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty (I 'm giving away my secret that I just don't approve them on on pure whim!) and the products such counterparties are approved to trade.  Additionally, at the bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.  The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel spreadsheets.  If I have missed a counterparty let me know).  The information for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about 6-7 weeks ago.  I am going to have to go back and input the power data from the original approval lists.  As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been entered for those products. You should count them as being approved for everything.  Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will delete them.  I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look and I will be glad to hear any input.  Obviously, we are all working out the kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along, so this database may evolve over time.  The only people who should have change access are the Legal team (Mike Neves:  Mark Taylor, Carol St Clair, Leslie Hansen, Marie Heard and myself). Let me know if you have change access by mistake.  On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database confidential to the group we have granted view access to. Do not forward this email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval.  Much thanks! 
 I would like to take responsibility for the technical side of this, but in all honesty I must admit I'm just the idea guy...(I'm know I'm breaking all your illusions about me today, I'll have no more secrets!) 
 1.  Per my discussion last week with David Minns, I sent him a spreadsheet so he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products EnronOnline offers so he could determine whether an Australian based counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the EnronOnline products.  It was my understanding that he had not seen a comprehensive list off all the products we offer.  2.  However, on a going forward basis, David Minns or someone in Legal will need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new Australian based counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a Credit and a Legal signoff for trading every products we offer, whether physical, financial, power, gas, liquids, weather, p&p, US, European or other country based product, etc..  Houston Legal does it every day for every new Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every new London Credit based counterparty and Australian Legal will need to do the same.  If some other system will be in place in Australia, David Minns will need to discuss that with Mark Taylor and David Forster. 
 Please find attached referenced lists.  It is not clear to me yet how we are going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.  I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties... 
 Now might be your time to plant!  I'm already miserable with the Houston summer heat.  It's already in the high 90's with high 90 humidity.  After 4-5 more months of this it's going to get pretty old!  How's little Sophie.  Any new cute things she's doing you need to tell me about? 
 Mark,  I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you... 
 Lou,  I left Mark Tawney a voicemail to call me re: the ISDA sample form.  I'll need to know a little bit more about the company so I send them the right form. 
 The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who still needs to complete his training).  Please let me know if you cannot log in.  I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their perspective why you should not be able to log in. 
 I have tried to call him directly but he was not available. 
 Yes, I left him a voicemail telling him I needed to know a little more about the counterparty so I could make sure i send them the right form (are they US or non-US counterparty, insurance company, energy company, etc).  Also, the name and address of his contact and I will send it directly if he would prefer that. 
 We have received an executed amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated March 20, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I will be out Friday afternoon and Monday afternoon for my termite and house inspections for my new house. 
 Per my voicemail, the attached confirm is still a moving target with the tax lawyers, I'll be in touch once we resolve the tax language. 
 I have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial confirmation process and ISDA Master Agreements.  I have also seen information on your company in the January 1999 issue of Risk Magazine.  I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the Legal Dept. and am looking at software systems that can help us manage our documentation needs.  If you are unfamiliar with our company,  Enron is the largest integrated marketer of energy in the United States.  We have a Web Page located at www.enron.com.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. is the marketing affiliate of our parent, Enron Corp.  I would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide, and after I have a chance to look at the information, would like to talk to you or a representative from you company in some depth.  I am located in Houston, Texas and my phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Thank your for your attention herewith. 
 We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in April.  If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to address them in our training.  Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll check them against our schedule.  Would your group organize this lunch or ours?  How many people are we talking about.  Only Global Contract or Global Counterparty too?  Let me know the details so we can start planning... 
 Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going forward basis.  To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power. This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us evidence of their FERC licensing. 
 On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but we are not there yet.  On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am opening them up for all financial and power. 
 I spoke to Harry Collins, one of our emissions lawyers, and he said there should be no problem trading emissions with a governmental entity on the emissions auction website, as long as they can trade emissions generally.  If you have any specific questions, call Harry Collins at x39692. 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  NOTE:   This master appears to have been signed in 1996 and didn't make its way down to Houston until now.  Type of Contract: Master Agreement (ECT Canada Form)  Effective Date:  06/16/95  Executed Date:  06/24/96  Enron Entity:  Enron Capital and Trade Resources Canada Corp., now known as Enron Canada Corp.  Counterparty:  Originally, NOVAGAS CLEARINGHOUSE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, now through name changes and merger, DYNEGY CANADA INC.  Transactions Covered: Energy price swaps or option transactions only (no pulp & paper, weather, interest rate & currency or FX)  GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  We need to get this master inputted immediately into the EnronOnline System so all of the confirmations for ENA and ECC will immediately roll up under this master.  CONFIRM DESK:  Please immediately start rolling up all the ENA and ECC trades under this master, whether online, offline, or brokered trades. 
 Novagas has a long and tortured history...when you've got a few hours and want to be incredibly bored I'll share it with you.  Let's just say that Canada has been the only one aware of this signed master.  You can quote my somewhat eloquent words "if it ain't in Legal it ain't!" 
 You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in with the rest of Legal's.  Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.  Once we are in agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.  The theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian counterparties.  Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m. the next day (which will be your morning) from the transmittal of the list. 
 In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.  Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week. Much thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Kathy Bolan at PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation (and my confirmation thereof with Messrs. Suttle and Bowen), all cross-border trades between PG&E Canada and ENA should go under the master between PG&E Canada and ECC. 
 Thank you for your help.  I look forward to hearing from your U.S. person. 
 We have received the fully executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999 between ECC and the referenced counterparty. This First Amendment adds the British Columbia Securities representation to the ISDA Master Agreement.  Confirm Desk:  You no longer have to add this representation to every confirmation. 
 I have not started responding for Australia yet. 
 Can you add Paul Radous in Credit with full edit capability to this database.  Much thanks! 
 Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.  I have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and physical power (through EPMI).  Can you please let me know first, if you have a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties and date of the contract.  Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a RUSH. 
 As usual, you are the best! 
 Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.  We just got a master in signed with them and they cannot trade weather, pulp & paper & fx. Much thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Kathy Moore this morning, please open the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products. 
 Ughh... 
 Mark said you would know who it is in London that prepared a "script" for your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal.  Liz Sager is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and needs to prepare a similar script for them.  If you could let me know who to contact I'd appreciate it.  Thanks for your help! 
 Thanks for your help in getting this done.  You're a star! 
 Mr. Holtz,  At the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am enclosing a sample copy of the referenced Master Agreement.  This agreement is subject to Legal and Credit review of the counterparty.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529.  We look forward to hearing from you.     Tana Jones Sr. Legal Specialist 
 Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.  We got a signed master agreement in place with them and I need to change the approvals. Thanks. 
 Can you please add the new credit person below for full edit priviliges to the Financial Trading Agreement  database.  Much thanks! 
 Did you notice on the spreadsheet for 3/27 they opened a new power product, US East Power Phys Firm ICAP? 
 Do you have any idea what David is trying to get at! 
 I am flying, are you?  If you are on my flight I would be happy to have you drive to the airport with me.  If you need to know my reservations, I can email them to you. 
 Is everything OK? 
 You be the man!  Can you email or fax the trader guidelines Scott is talking about.  Much thanks! 
 I'm glad to hear that everything is good.  I'm so excited for you, you'll be a wonderful mother!   XXOO 
 Attached is the proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement with Platt's. 
 Some notes on the attached lists:  3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my earlier approvals.  3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do pulp & paper and weather under it. Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status. In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine what if anything they can do.  3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week. 
 On this Statoil Trade, I guess this is a physical trade done with ENA.  Can you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so I can attach them to my assignment.  I am forever in your debt... 
 Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".  Not to get you worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!  After all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.  (Not to belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".)  We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after viewing, we don't want the other lads to get jealous!) 
 Attached is a proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced party. 
 Obviously Frank, you are trying to kill me...! 
 What ever happened to that CGAS certificate we were trying to get in connection with my swap agreement?  Last note I had was that resolution we were trying to get requires approval of Board for each trade and you were going to talk to Mark about how to resolve this.  Was it resolved? 
 David has sent us a memo re: Procedures for Approval to trade in Australia that I think you will find helpful. 
 I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap participant.  For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.  So this ball is in Credit's court. 
 Per your request... 
 Sounds good to me!  Saturday, 8:00 am at Buffalo Grille it is! 
 Attached is the referenced Confidentiality Agreement.  I hope to have the Fieldston one to you shortly. 
 Attached please find the referenced agreement. 
 Per the request of Sara, attached is the form of US online GTC (w/collateral). 
 We have received notice that the referenced counterparty is updating its phone system and is changing all of its phone numbers.  I am sending a copy of the notice to the usual distribution. 
 The list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for documentation, which includes Connie Sutton from Global Contracts.  As to what numbers they are replacing, they are replacing all the phone numbers we might have had across the board with this counterparty.  If you would like to see the numbers, obtain a copy of the notice from Connie Sutton.  As I just mailed it, it should get there in a few days. 
 Per my voicemail, attached is my list of agreements. 
 Your big opportunity appears to be here!  Some guy in the for sale database under misc messages is looking to put together a team for the year 2000. This is your big break... 
 Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade credit derivatives.  Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" , "amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives. Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.  I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't. 
 There is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on the 3/30/00 list, so I am not sending that list.  On the list for 3/31/00, first, David Minns is in the Houston office today, so I gave the response today for the one Australian counterparty on this list.  We are meeting with Mark on Wednesday to try and figure out the approval process for Australia, so maybe after Wednesday I'll start responding for them.  Second, on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have been indicated as credit derivative counterparties, so none of the counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives (even though I haven't "X'ed" them out). 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated April 3, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Attached are the Confidentiality Agreements for the referenced counterparties. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  Remember, no credit derivatives are approved for any counterparites unless Credit has indicated they are a credit derivative counterparty on the list. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated April 4, 2000 with the referenced counterparty amending the Electronic Trading Agreement .  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received the executed copy of the amendment dated April 5, 2000 to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received fully executed copies of the following Confidentiality Agreements:  Energy Argus, Inc. dated April 5, 2000  AccuWeather, Inc. dated April 4, 2000  Copies have been faxed to the counterparties.  I will also send copies to Dave Samuels for your files. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Again, my note about credit derivatives not being marked, and also, I am still not responding for Australia yet on a going forward basis. 
 Are we trading with the referenced counterparty? 
 Russell,  In the future please put me on all notices about counterparty trading.  I am responsible for the Legal Department's approval of online counterparties across all product areas and need to know any limitations that might affect a counterparties' ability to trade.  Thanks! 
 Troy Black called me about that C.A. I passed on to you.  He said he needed it to go out today and also passed on words from the counterparty to the effect that the C.A. was "non-negotiable and that if we had any comments they need to be minor, or forget about it..."  There you have it! 
 We have executed a Letter Agreement dated April 10, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 She seemed very nice, like she would make a good employee.  I spoke to Liz Sager who, although she didn't directly work with her, got report from her old law firm of people that did, and Liz said to was extremely well liked, and very energetic. 
 I have a letter on its way to Mike Moscoso right now (interoffice mail).  We requested 5000 for nat gas any one month, but were only approved for an additional 2000.  So we went from 15,000 to 17,000.  Welcome back! 
 Attached is an updated list of the Confidentiality Agreements. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  I am not sending the list for 4/5/00 because all of the counterparties on that list were Credit declines. I have responded for Australia Legal on the 4/7/00 list.  Remember, no credit derivatives approved unless specifically indicated (which none are). 
 We do have it signed.  However, the Company's name was not correct in the agreement so I spoke to Wayne Greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead and change the name on the C.A. he signed, and I just wanted to get a copy back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his agreement. 
 Bob, can you send me a copy of the EnronOnline confirm so I can prepare this.  Thanks! 
 Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke. I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees. Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?  We sent execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on the inactive status. 
 I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email below.  Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response. MUCH THANKS!  For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.  What rules, besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off exchange trades you might enter into.  For instance, here in the U.S. energy commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options might be governed by the SEC.  Besides the exchanges your email reflected, what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might enter into? 
 I have not been getting a response from my outside the U.S. attorneys, so I just emailed them a reminder again, and tried to make them feel really guilty.  I hope that works! 
 Actually, we girls have that built in guilt gene, it just improves with age...but do I need to speak to your mother?  Is there anything you would like to confess...? 
 What can I say...?! 
 fax: ( 713) 646-3490 
 David,  What Australian laws besides the rules of the exchange would govern the trades? 
 Can you please prepare a print out for us of all the financial masters your records reflect and what type of agreement we have executed .  Thanks! 
 FYI,  To date, we have executed 21 amendments to ETA's. 
 We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement from the referenced counterparty and I have faxed it to counterparty today.  A copy will be sent to Dave. 
 Thanks for your response!  On online, when there are Australian counterparties I will just wait to hear from you and include your responses with mine (even tho you will  probably tell me they can only trade Australian power!).  Do you have a back up yet? 
 Oops, what a surprise!  When I went to file away my file on the CFTC Form 40, I noticed I already had a file in the regulatory cabinet where where had filed the form in 1995 and 1997.  Maybe we have to file these every other year? 
 We have received the executed Termination Agreement dated as of April 10, 2000 terminating the referenced trade.  Per the request of Jennifer de Boisblanc Denny, this termination was prepared because the customer hit the same product twice on EOL and two exact transactions were entered into the system.  I will send the original (fax) down to Bob Bowen for handling. 
 Attached is the referenced agreement.  Please do not hesitate to call me if I can be of any further assistance.  I am a paralegal in the Legal Dept.  My direct phone no is (713) 853-3399. 
 Mike,  Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment screen for the new products.  The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth  Thanks!  By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the master swap list.  I think I am going to need your help with that. 
 will someone be sending us the report? 
 I look forward to seeing you!  As soon as I get the recipes, I'll forward them on! 
 Who is Legal requested the master? 
 Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 for our luncheon.  Can you please confirm that that date is good for your group and also the total head count.  Suzanne will take care of ordering lunch for us.  Thanks! 
 Effective March 1, 2000, Aquila Energy acquired the assets of USGT (U.S. Gas Transportation Inc.) , with the acquiring entity being USGT/Aquila L.P.  USGT has assigned the Electronic Trading Agreement it executed with ENA to USGT/Aquila L.P.  A copy of the assignment will be forwarded to Frank Davis. 
 That envelope should probably go to Rob Milnthorp.  I'll have a copy walked down to John Lavorato here.  It is a list of all of our NYMEX positions, and the list should be provided by Rob to any traders trading NYMEX out of Canada. 
 What's your pleasure on the below guarantees? 
 I have nothing but the counterparty's request for assignment. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated April 12, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  For Tosco Refining Company, it should be set up as Tosco Refining Company, a division of Tosco Corporation. We need to get the incorporated entity on the hook. 
 There is an Australian counterparty on today's list. 
 No conflict with me.  I sent the date of the 24th to Anthony and asked him to confirm it with his people and get back to me. 
 Per our conversation, attached is the form of Amendment to the ETA, revised to reflect your correct name.  Also, while I was revising the document, I added today's date, and the page number and footer reflecting the document name.  Call me again at (713) 853-399 if you have any more questions, otherwise, I will await your fax of the signed amendment and bring it to one of our officers for signature. 
 Can you please add David Minns, a lawyer from our Australia office as an auhorized person with full privileges to the Master Swap Agreement Database (of course, only I should have keyword change and deletion ability). 
 tana jones will attend 
 Is your counterparty on today's list approved? 
 Edmund,  You are the only person I have now not heard from.  When can I expect to get your response?
