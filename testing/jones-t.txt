pm tomorrow. 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  I got that problem worked out on the 6/22 list and will send that to you shortly. 
 Please shut down the referenced cpy for financial trading.  I just found out they are a Bermuda corporation and I need to see if we can do financial transactions under Bermuda law. 
 Anytime!    Stacy E Dickson 06/28/2000 04:46 PM 
 I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware, since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US segment of bandwidth.  Since this is the only segment we are trading online yet, this isn't an issue.  But as we move forward and add more segments we are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based segments as we add them in the future. 
 Please add Carol St. Clair to the Credit Watch Lists for Houston and Canada. 
 Attached is the script revised w/Mark Taylor's comments. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated June 18, 2000.  Copies will be be sent Dave Samuels and Teresa Smith. 
 Teresa Smith was my contact on this one.    Louise Kitchen 06/29/2000 09:21 AM 
 Please call me with any comments or changes. 
 Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.  You can see it by clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet  where it says "MG New Cpys".  Ignore the first tab.  I am told by London Legal that our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.  Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.  We've got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.  So unless we hear otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties "read only" access. 
 I just got an updated list.  Please ignore the one I sent you a few minutes ago. 
 Attached is a copy of the London due diligence on China.  Per my conv. w/Edmund, it appears China is a "no" for financial transactions. 
 Thanks for your response.  Yes, I I do need to know two things.  First, the group you are in, and then second, what products you are trading out of the account.  The Enron Trading Policy prohibits employees from trading in any of the products the company trades in.  Thanks!     Frank Hayden@ENRON 06/29/2000 01:04 PM 
 Thanks for your help.  I really appreciate it!  Congrats on the new baby, how's she doing!?  Getting any sleep?  How's your son taking it?  Who does she look like? 
 Can you respond? 
 We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement:  Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:  05/15/00  Executed Date:  06/09/00  Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:  Pacific Gas & Electric Company  Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX  ALL PARTIES PLEASE NOTE:  1. DIVISION TRADING.  This counterparty may elect to do additional financial trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its California Gas Transmission Department.  If the Counterparty does elect to trade under these divisions, such trades should also be done under this master agreement.  No other divisions should be approved for any financial trading for Pacific Gas & Electric Company without prior approval from Legal.  However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions.  All payments must be treated separately.  It is critical that the PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly.  (CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.)  2. Canadian and US Trades:  All financial trades with this counterparty, whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this master agreement.  THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this.  3. GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  When we open them up to trade online, we need to make sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement. Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial product.  3. ONLINE TRADING:  It is critical that  the above information is captured correctly before we can open them up for online trading.  I will verbally confirm with each of the Online Team, Confirmation Desk, Global Contracts, and Payments/Settlements that we have this setup correctly before Legal approves them to trade online. 
 I say let them eat cake!    Stacy E Dickson 06/29/2000 01:43 PM 
 How should I respond to soybeans?  It is on the list of commodities we might trade. 
 At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our proposed amendment to the referenced master.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Carol at (713) 853-3989 if you have any comments or questions.  If the amendment meets with your approval, please have two copies executed by an authorized officer of J. Aron and return them to me for signature by Enron.  Thanks for your help! 
 Luanne,  I missed a few of Carol's changes so she asked me to resend the document. Sorry! 
 I don't think your attachment was attached.    "Giessen, Luanne" <luanne.giessen@gs.com> 06/30/2000 08:47 AM 
 I just spoke to John Cameron, the lawyer for the Company and our plan is to email him, an associate of his, and Doug Thomas the draft as soon as it is ready.    I will also fax John Cameron the draft.   Tracy Ngo in Credit is working up the credit, and I am doing as much of the draft as I can pending credit.  Carol St. Clair, a lawyer in our Group here in Houston, will be reviewing the draft.  As this is moving quickly, please provide us with any updates of information.    John Malowney 06/30/2000 09:36 AM 
 We have received the following three amendments to the ETA's, as indicated below:  Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Metropolitan Edison Company  Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Pennsylvania Electric Company  Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Jersey Central Power & Light Company  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have finally received comments on the ISDA from the referenced counterparty.  I have sent copies to each of you.  There were substantial comments to the guaranty so I have sent a copy of the guaranty along with the comments to Clem.  Clem,  congrats on that trophy! 
 You crack me up!  Your baby report made me laugh!  Keep me posted on how the kids are doing.  I enjoy your stories.  All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it. I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in a construction site.  I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!  Keep in touch...! 
 John, you can take Shari Stack off these emails.  She is a lawyer working on the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading agreements.  Carol St. Clair is the lawyer working on this master (I'm a paralegal).  Thanks.    "Cameron, John" <johncameron@DWT.COM> 06/30/2000 11:41 AM 
 Thanks for the credit!    Tracy Ngo 06/30/2000 01:03 PM 
 Attached please find a draft of the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement between Bellingham Cold Storage Co. and Enron North America Corp.  Please call Carol St. Clair, Assistant General Counsel, at (713) 853-3989 with any questions or comments you may have.  My direct dial number is (713) 853-3399. 
 You are so very welcome!    John Malowney 06/30/2000 03:13 PM 
 We really haven't used the Local Currency form in several years.  We found that we were getting requests to switch to the Multicurrency Form so frequently that we made the Multicurrency our primary form.  In the long run we have found that the Multicurrency Form gives us the most flexibility as the trading markets become more international in nature.  If you prefer the Local Currency it may take me asome time when we get back on Wednesday to compare the forms and convert the document over.  Please let me know if that is your preference.    "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 06/30/2000 05:15 PM 
 I have scheduled taking Monday and Tuesday July 17 & 18 off to visit my family in New York. 
 Attached is a unilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement where Counterparty is the protected party.  This form needs a little tweaking since it is more directed for a financing transaction.  Peter can find it, as well as other forms, in the attorney forms bank.  Call me, or have Peter call me, if I can be of further help. 
 I spoke to Serge Martin, their outside counsel, and he said it's on his list, but he hasn't been able to get to it.  Maybe in another month... 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated June 28, 2000 wherein Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. ("Assignor") assigned its interest in certain natural gas wholesale and derivatives transactions with Enron North America Corp. to J. Aron & Company ("Assignee").  A copy of the trades being assigned is attached to the assignment which will be distributed to the usual distribution group, plus Bob Klein. 
 I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading Group.  I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell you what a good job he has been doing for our group.  I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly respond to our client, the online trading group.  Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us meet the needs of our clients.  Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a valuable asset to your team! 
 In case you were wondering... 
 I just wanted to give you an update on the NDA for the referenced counterparty.  I faxed your signed draft to Andrew Hausman this morning.  He finally got back to me a few minutes ago to let me know that he's looking for a lawyer on his side to review it.  He has one comments already I'll run by Mark.  Otherwise, we're waiting for him to get back with his lawyer's comments. 
 We have received the executed Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 30, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Per my conv. w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.  Per our understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them.     David Forster@ENRON 07/05/2000 05:01 PM 
 Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.  It won't be as painful a process, since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the books.  Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)... 
 Boy, was she quick.  We appear to have only one trade to assign, so Credit, I guess you are OK with this, and Bob, you don't show any other crude trades do you? 
 Do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements MG has in place?  When can we receive copies? 
 Mark asked me to get your input regarding a Canadian form question.  We have the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements:  Limitation of Rate.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to such party.   For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis.  Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?  Is there some special magic to the above highlighted language?  Thanks for your help. 
 Per Lotus Notes, it looks like Susan Flynn sent them a draft on 5/23 and hasn't heard from them.  The name of the person she sent it to was Adrian Brabham. 
 Mark spoke to Bloomberg and their attorney with Wilkie Farr, and they made substantial revisions to the form.  I just faxed a clean and blacklined draft to them and am waiting to get their approval.  Will you be around to sign? 
 We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement with Bloomberg PowerMatch LLC and Bloomberg L.P dated July 6, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Anita,  You were going to fax me the form of assignment...     "Anita Herrera" <aherrera@statoilenergy.com> 07/05/2000 06:06 PM 
 Fax no is 713/646-3490.     "Anita Herrera" <aherrera@statoilenergy.com> 07/06/2000 06:03 PM 
 Can you send him a copy of this.  Thanks. 
 Jill,  We haven't seen credit come through yet.  We can't do anything without it.    Jill T Zivley 07/03/2000 12:19 PM

 Thanks for your email.  As you aleady appear to be aware, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees from tading any products the company trades.   As you may or may not be aware, the products the company trades has expanded beyond energy commodities, we trade interest rates & currencies, pulp & paper, weather, and metals.

 Robbi,  What impact will the advice below have on our Japanese bandwidth approvals? Right now I have them OK to trade the US segment.  Based on the advice below do you think we will need to get a license as a "telecommunications carrier"?  Should I shut Japan down for now?    Robbi Rossi@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 07/07/2000 08:51 AM 
 We have received the executed amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated June 23, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the pulp & paper trades to that website.  In oder to determine whether any of the counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper online.  Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?  Thanks! 
 Re: the Statoil Assignment  The Statoil master will not be terminated. They sold their existing natgas & crude oil book to J. Aron.  They may trade other products out of that master, or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those products.  So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under the J. Aron master.  Everything else should remain the same. 
 You would need to talk to Mike Moscosco.  I don't know, but perhaps they don't change the report for a 1 month approval only.    Steven J Ehrig@ENRON 07/07/2000 01:36 PM 
 Gene,  As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project Services Agreement in Enron's files.  I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original agreement is.  How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.? 
 I am working with the Click Paper.com lawyers on their online documentation, and they want to see a UK form of financial GTC.  Can you send me one?  As ever, in your debt... 
 Jeff,  We are also usually sent a page from some tax book that show the rate of withholding for each of the treaty countries.  Their rate of withholding will impact which form we may or may not need.  Can you send it to me?  Thanks!    Jeff Blumenthal 07/07/2000 04:53 PM 
 The page out of the book we were sent last year says "Treaty Withholding Tax Rates" , and under it is says "The following are US withholding tax rates for dividend, interest and royalty payments from the United States to residents of various treaty countries.  Then below there it has a list which shows the Country, Dividends %, Interest%, Patent and Know-how Royalties.    Jeff Blumenthal 07/07/2000 05:11 PM 
 Thanks as usual for the prompt response.  You are a star!    Edmund Cooper 07/07/2000 05:41 PM 
 Attached please find the lists referenced above, except the list for 7/6/00. which just has 1 declined counterparty on it. 
 I walked past that office and it still looked a little messy.  Is someone from Prjoect Rock going to clean it out? 
 Below is a new gas product.  Any issues I need to be aware of? 
 Can you send me your form(s) of Password Applications?!  Thanks!  I needed to talk to you about MG, because I am really backed up and have not been able to get to that counterparty list.  What is my drop dead date? 
 Yes, we have an ISDA in place with Georgia Pacific Corporation.    John Malowney 07/11/2000 12:27 PM 
 This counterparty came across on my online list for today.  I took a look at the master you have in your office, and to me it seems to be approved for all products, including weather & pulp & paper, just not FX.  In Susan Flynn's email she said no pulp & paper.  Which is correct? 
 Attached is the referenced amendment.  Please call me or Carol if we can be of further service. 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need a Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 In order to get you phone service here, the phone people want your passport number since you don't have a social security number.  Can you provide it to Joyce Dorsey, an assistant here in Legal.  She's working with Sylvia to get your office set up.  Thanks! 
 I don't see that I got a response from Leslie on the above list.  Can you check this one too?  Thanks! 
 I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in is Gladiator.  This is major!  I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of the summer, and probably the year.  How will I know which barbarian is you? Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!  This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)... 
 I thought that body looked pretty buff!  I should have known it was you.  So you got paid extra for the horse and the body double work!    Justin Boyd 07/12/2000 11:16 AM

 London Legal called and the referenced US counterparty has come through the London Credit based list, and they need to know if they have a US power marketing license.  Can you let me know?  Thanks! 
 London Legal wants to know if this is done? 
 Attached is that RUSH guaranty Stuart Zisman called about.  We need to get it signed today.  We will also need the Certificate with respect to the incumbency of the officer signing the guaranty.  Thanks! 
 Ted,  Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in detail:  "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."  Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that language? 
 Attached is the language for insertion in the confirmation. 
 Thanks Genia!    Genia FitzGerald 07/13/2000 12:43 PM

 Thanks Kristin!    Kristin Albrecht 07/13/2000 06:51 PM 
 I spoke to Tanya and she said they only do energy trading through J. Aron, all the interest rate and currency trading is done through Goldman, so we don't need language re: that business.  Also, I ran it by her, and she does want the language in the credit rating section of the MAC about "not supported by third party credit enhancement." 
 Thanks!.  I'll fax it back to you after it's signed.    "Pete Groetzinger" <pgroetzinger@brentbroker.com> 07/13/2000 07:08 PM 
 It was good seeing you.  Thanks for dinner.  Shawna and I were waiting for your call about a coffee (she even said she'd buy!), but I guess we missed you for this trip.  She sends her regards!  I harassed Justy about his movie career.  He told me he was the body double for Russell Crowe.  I asked him whether he and/or his horse had hired agents yet (depending on who was getting better reviews!)  Keep me posted on the house.  It looked great! 
 Is this only available to the Legal Group?  There are a few people in Credit and Global Contracts that might find this helpful.  Please add me to the list.  Thanks!    Sylvia Hu@ENRON 07/13/2000 05:51 PM 
 Did you get this? 
 Serge,  That was sent to you yesterday morning.  I guess you didn't get it? 
 Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the referenced counterparty for review.  There is no indication of what Enron business person is interested in this counterparty.  I will forward a copy of the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the contact information.  We won't do anything until we receive a credit worksheet from Credit. 
 None of the counterparties on your Mexico counterparty list should be approved to trade:  any financial product, physical bandwidth, and physical power.  When I get back to the office on Wednesday, I will do up your spreadsheets.  Thanks! 
 Are there any individuals in your group that might find this seminar beneficial? 
 Please keep me on the distribution for all credit worksheets.  Thanks. 
 I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest change question we asked him.  You'll see, he sent us both a fax with proposed changes to that section.  When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.  It wasn't a clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on this. 
 John, I've been out of the office for two days and just got in.   I take it that Cowlitz PUD is a governmental entity?  Our usual sample form does not have the governmental provisions.  I would think we would want to send them a sample with those provisions in there, because they would be rather surprised if they got a draft from us at some point and it had all these additional provisions in there.  Can you confirm for me that they are a governmental/quasi-governmental?  Also, have you requested credit from Credit?    John Malowney 07/17/2000 11:25 AM 
 We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated July 13, 2000.   A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels for the files.  Also, attached is an updated list of the Online Confidentiality Agreement for your review.  Please call me at x33399 with any comments or questions. 
 FYI:  Attached is the list of Online Confidentiality Agreements. 
 Per email below, counterparty would like to put some masters in place with us.  We will need credit before we can proceed. 
 You're the best!    Tanya Rohauer 07/19/2000 03:52 PM 
 I'm still trying to get an appointment set up with the Documentum people. One of the things I need to get from you is what is the current software you are using, so they know what software they've got to be compatible with.  Can you send me an email back.  Thanks. 
 Please handle.  Thanks! 
 There is no documentation to evidence this, it is an operation of law.  Being a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity. It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a "dba" (which means "doing business as") or "assumed name" for an incorporated entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples might be "Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division" or "Tana Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company" or "TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones Inc."  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's master.  P.S. Susan Flynn is on an extended leave of absence.     Stacey Richardson 07/20/2000 05:36 PM 
 Deb,  Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is not showing up on the list.  Thanks! 
 In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following information:  1.  The company's full legal name 2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form 3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of transaction is it for) 4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number 5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to talk to them) 
 Bill,  I looked, and you're not a VP of Enron Corp. either.  Maybe you need to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out... 
 Per our conversation, attached is the Authorized Trader List.  Can you have Gary review it Monday when he gets back, as we are opening a new brokerage account and we need to provide the list to the brokerage firm. 
 Do you have any updates to the Pulp & Paper group? 
 Why do we want Andy to sign the draft going out?  If it's not a rush, it makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like "this is not negotiable!".    Savita Puthigai@ENRON 07/21/2000 10:32 AM 
 I still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the counterparty.   If you are not going to locate this, I need to know because I am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty.  1.  Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of Enron Power Marketing  (this would have covered physical power, not financial).  I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of ECT Canada dated as of March 11, 1997 from the Calgary office, so that one is taken care of. 
 Brent Hendry, an attorney that used to be in our group in Houston, then went to Argentina, is now back.  He had review only access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Can you get him added ASAP with full edit capability. Thanks! 
 Scott,  Is there someone else in your group who can get Brent access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database? 
 He has view access, but he doesn't have edit capability, which he needs.    Scott Cleverly 07/21/2000 03:28 PM 
 Below is the initial list of the ClickPaper.com counterparties.  As usual, let me know if you have any issues, otherwise I will consider them approved 1 day after transmittal of the list. 
 We need to set up a new database as soon as possible when you get back.  We have a new online trading system starting Tuesday, ClickPaper.com, and I will need to mirror the Online Trading Database.  Can you call me when you get back. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I understand that the Western Area Power Administration - Upper Great Plain has been bugging us to get opened up for physical power, so you might want to give a rush approval on that one. 
 No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.  You have two on the 7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United States Department of Energy.  Can you please change the name on the accounts.  I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name on to the account.   The people who approve Password Applications should be sorting this out.  Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.  Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 Please note that we are in a dispute with Enage Energy US, LP with respect to power trading, and they are shut down for power trading only until such dispute is resolved.  I have already confirmed this with Stephanie. 
 Not much going on.  I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration for me.  I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford their services.  When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that they've done their homework.  They're about to lose my business.  In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our own software.  I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the project.  The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for document creation more attractive. 
 Thanks Mike!    Michael Neves 07/24/2000 11:25 AM 
 Attached is a revised draft of the Authorized Trader List.  We need to open a pulp & paper brokerage account today, so we will need to get this signed by the end of the day.  Please let me know if Ted has any comments.  If not, I will get it initialled and bring it to Ted for signature.   I am wating to hear from Sara as to whether we should add agricultural to the list.  Per Gary, the list will be the same exact list as financial.  Thanks! 
 Mary Cook signed off with a few minor changes.  Attached is the amendment with the revised numbers.  Please check them and let me know if they are OK. 
 FYI, 
 We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.  We do have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.  I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).  We will await Credit's instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the documentation. 
 At the request of Bill Bradford in our Credit Department, I am attaching our proposed amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement between HS Resources, Inc. and Enron North America.  Please let me know if the amendment meets with your approval.  My phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Tana L. Jones Sr. Legal Specialist 
 Do you have access to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can look these dates up?    Bernice Rodriguez 07/24/2000 05:31 PM 
 It is in my "forms" subdirectory, called "questionnaire-umbrella re internet trading1.doc.    Brent Hendry@ENRON 07/24/2000 06:05 PM 
 I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155 Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB  H3B 5G2. The contact is Theresa Pace (French pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.  I spoke to Harry Arora about it, and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.  So when you have a minute, let's talk about what to do. 
 Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES. 
 Gosh, I'm getting so good at this I might not need you anymore...did I not see that one coming or what!    Leslie Hansen 07/25/2000 10:00 AM 
 Jeff,  Would you handle this or would Alan, or both of you? 
 Below is John's contact as Boeing.  He would like to get some credit so we can get this counterparty an ISDA.  I understand that you are under the gun today, if you could just let us know when we might be able to get some credit.  Much thanks! 
 Mark,  I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney. I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your direction as to how I should handle this.  I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone number is 713/853-3399. 
 I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list Credit sent me).  One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical power.  Like the other European based physical power products, it should not be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a particular one).  Is that OK with you.  Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit opened them up for all financial power).  I had already opened them up for all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  There are only 2 counterparties for approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.  Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add financial power.  I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products with utilities under Virginia law.  Notes in our database reflect that this was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.  I have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to resolve this directly with them.  Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas Company, and that needs to be made part of the name. 
 I still need to see you about that Market Disruption summary for the Husky Oil Global Contract Datasheet so I can close up that file. 
 At the request of Andy Zipper, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any comments or questions. 
 Alan & Harry  Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the two of you their spreadsheets.  However, it appears the physical side of the business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you the list.  It's up to you.  Let me know. 
 Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp. was originally shut down for financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.  Since then, we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental utilities.  Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp. (and moved the Aquila trades under it).  Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp. for all financial products. 
 The referenced counterparty has already been approved to trade all physical and financial products offered online.  I am not sure if we need to see this counterparty come through again as a Click Paper counterparty or not.  I'll let Tom decide.   For me, I'm OK. 
 David,  A clarification...  On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a correct interpretation?    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/25/2000 06:01 PM 
 It is OK to sign the copy I emailed to you.  Just return the signed copy  to me via fax 713/646-3490 and I will get is signed by an authorized officer here and return it to you.  In your fax please tell me who you would like me to send the return fax to.  Thanks for your prompt attention with this! 
 I have already responded to the counterparty.    Savita Puthigai@ENRON 07/26/2000 03:37 PM 
 Done at last!  Whew, I'm whooped!  Now it's your turn to have fun! Unfortunatel, I have a call into David Minns about one issue, and I hope when he responds it doesn't change my approvals... 
 Per our conversation last night, can you take a look at my list of country product approvals and let me know if there are any updates to the information.  Thanks. 
 Try talking to Nadeem Tufail in London.  I believe he is a paralegal that is responsible for their corporate filings. 
 Leslie,  On the attached list they have PPL Electric Utilties Corporation & PPL Energy Plus as amended and new, but you didn't respond to them.  I have no record on PPL Electric Utilities, so can you treat that as a new counterparty even though it says amended.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I am still waiting on 1 response for the list from the 24th. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated 7/26/00.  Copies will be sent to Andy Zipper and a copy to Dave Samuels for the files. 
 Mark said you were going to provide me with the info to do a Confidentiality Agreement for the Houston Chronicle.  What's the scoop there? 
 Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we offer newprint commodity swaps and options online. 
 The resolution The Bakersfield Californian provided to us when we signed the ISDA Agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to do with us to "...newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions." In order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the ISDA Agreement we would need a new resolution from the Company expanding the types of products they are approved to do with us. 
 Anthony, I have no idea what that questions means...    Anthony Campos 07/27/2000 02:35 PM 
 Attached please find Deemed ISDA. 
 I forgot one thing.  I have that rotted board on the garage wall near the garden, we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 2x2 or 2/4 or whatever it is, and then painting that.  Do you remember?  By the way, I can't believe you're alive.  By the way you've been quiet, I thought you were maybe in that plane too...! 
 Holly,  Attached is a sample incumbency certificate.        "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 07/25/2000 11:10 AM 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:   Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, attached is our form of Letter of Credit. 
 Holly,  Having both of them included in the certificate will be fine.  Frequently, companies do not know who will be available to sign, so they list more than one signer.    "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 07/28/2000 04:49 PM 
 We have received and executed Master Agreement:   Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:   April 28, 2000  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.   Counterparty:   Kinder Morgan, Inc.  Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp & Paper Foreign Exchange
