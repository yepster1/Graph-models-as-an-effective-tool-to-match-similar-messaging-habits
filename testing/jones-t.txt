. subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (and contains a Hydro-Quebec guaranty).  You might want to point this out to some of your traders who might be interested in trading under it. 
 We just got the executed ISDA Master and guaranty in with the referenced counterparty, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (you may have noticed my email). The Counterparty wants to trade with us online immediately.  Can we get them on as an amended counterparty on Monday's list, and can we get them opened to trade financial on Monday? 
 Per Leslie Hansen, above counterparty will not be approved to trade power online.  She said she spoke to counterparty and they are a distribution company and not FERC approved to sell power.  So we will not change that profile. 
 I am looking for the merger documents dated 12/30/99 wherein Devon Energy Corp. merged with Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., and PennzEnergy Exploration and Production Company, L.L.C.  If you've got a copy can you fax it to me via 646-3490.  Thanks! 
 Why do we have so many deals from Coral that need to be assigned?    Kevin Meredith@ENRON 11/06/2000 10:58 AM 
 Can someone talk to Coral so I can get out of the business of assigning "oops" trades... 
 Thanks, I appreciate it!    Cheryl Johnson@ENRON 11/06/2000 11:11 AM 
 Re: Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  Per Leslie, not a FERC approved counterparty.  This cpy can have read-only access for US power products. Leslie spoke to Dinanna Dechilly at the authority and they are not interested in trading power at this time, but will let her know when they are.  She will have to follow up with them re: their FERC approved status at that time. 
 We have received the fully executed Unanimous Written Consent of Managers of EnronOnline, LLC  dated 11/6/00, effective as of 10/11/00, which appoints Amita Gosalia, Dale Neuner and Sheri Thomas as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of EOL.  This resolution will expire one year from the date of its effectiveness.  When you execute, please sign as "Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".

 We have received the executed Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated 10/31/00 between the referenced counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Just an update on the status of the signing.  As of Friday, Duke supposedly had signed their documents but wouldn't fax them over because they didn't like the certificate that Enron Corp. provided with respect to the guaranty. Clement Abrams,  Enron Corp.'s lawyer, spoke to Duke's lawyer this morning and is preparing an additional certificate that should address their concerns.  He is getting it signed and will then fax it directly to them and give me the original for transmittal.  I'll keep you posted on how things progress... 
 Are these physical, financial or both?    Melissa Ann Murphy 11/07/2000 09:43 AM 
 Please try and open up HQ Energy Services ASAP. 
 Gaylord Container is shut down by Credit, but it should be open, so it is going to come back thru as an amended counterparty. 
 The above counterparty should be coming on tonight's list.  We would like to open them for gas ASAP, and Credit is reviewing the financials now to give them some headroom on power.  If you could let me know ASAP whether you have any issues. 
 Enron North America Corp. has executed a Consent to Assignment dated 10/05/00 with respect to the Master Repurchase Agreement dated 01/22/97 between ENA and Goldman Sachs Canada (a limited partnership), wherein Goldman Sachs Canada has assigned its position in the agreement and transactions thereunder to Goldman Sachs Canada Inc. (a corporation).  Copies of the consent will be distributed. 
 Thanks for such a prompt response!    Harry M Collins 11/07/2000 02:38 PM 
 Please add Mark Taylor to this training.  He has put it on his calendar.    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/07/2000 02:48 PM 
 I take it you signed off on this new product.  It is pretty common that we just copy the profile for a similar product for the existing 1500-2000 counterparties.  Let me know if you think this is a problem. 
 OK w/me. 
 Scott,  Can you pass on Mary Solmonson's memo to the appropriate London lawyer responsible for Norway power contracts.  Mary is the head of Global Contracts here in Houston, and Phillipe Travis works for Mary, and just went over to London to work on getting systems in place for Global Contracts in London.  Thanks for your help! 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:17 PM 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:19 PM 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:20 PM 
 Sounds to me like you don't need to worry about opening them up for power...! 
 Call Leslie Hansen at x36121.  She is a lawyer and will be able to help you. I am a paralegal that assists her.    Stephen Abbanat@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/07/2000 05:14 PM 
 I haven't heard anything back from you re: this approval.  The EOL people need a sign off ASAP. 
 I heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a FERC license.  He is going to have to talk to her and clear this up.    Mary Griff Gray 11/08/2000 08:29 AM 
 I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.  There was also a few updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.  If and when Mark calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went, because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it. 
 I'm talking to their lawyer right now.  He's checking with his power team to find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power Credit person to get me some headroom.  Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as we speak!    Mary Griff Gray 11/08/2000 09:17 AM 
 US Legal would have no problem doing business with a Connecticut limited liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).  There are some legal considerations with respect to certain products.  In order to trade any financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.  Otherwise, we have no problem with limited liability companies.    Stephanie Sever 11/08/2000 08:52 AM 
 Thanks for the good word!    Mary Griff Gray 11/08/2000 09:42 AM 
 Can we open up ANP for gas ASAP.  They have been dying to trade.  They want to trade power but so far Credit has not given them any headroom for power and they do not appear to have a FERC license in this name.  We are working with them trying to figure out how they can trade power. 
 Coral Energy Holdings is where we have the financial master.  Are you OK with this assignment? 
 Can you please respond to Diane.  Thanks. 
 We do have an ISDA Agreement in place between Koch Energy Trading and ENA, but Anthony is correct on a number of accounts.  First, we could not put Oslo trades under this master.  It is a Local Currency form and could not be used for any non US transaction. Second, it is quite old and our forms have evolved since then and we would not want to replicate this form.  Lastly, it has the old "ERMS" style collateral annex, and we would want to use an ISDA Credit Support Annex on a going forward basis.  I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson in London Legal and Rod Nelson in London Credit and getting a new master based off our current form.  Tana Jones, Houston Legal     Matthew Allan 11/09/2000 06:43 AM 
 I'm passing on for response. 
 A fellow from Western Publishing Company called Anthony Camppos in Global Contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the master with us and trade(s) thereunder.  He referenced Deal No. EK9839.1. I'm not sure by this note if the company is being liquidated or just this trades, but you might want to give them a call.  Jim McClymont at (308) 532-7118 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement for each of Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. and Amerex Power, Ltd.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Bob at (713) 853-0397  if you have any comments or questions. 
 Will attend.    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/09/2000 11:01 AM 
 This counterparty is approved for all financial. 
 Robert Jones appears to be a VP of Enron Net Works, but not EnronOnline.  By copy of this email to Deb Korkmas, I would like to confirm that the above is correct, and if it is, can we please get Robert Jones added as a VP of EnronOnline.  Thanks!    Leslie Hansen 11/09/2000 01:00 PM 
 I'm interested!  Would it be OK to invite one of my new business people from London, she doesn't know anyone in Houston yet?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 11/09/2000 04:01 PM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated October 31, 2000 between webMethods, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dovie Keprta. 
 We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't think we use it to trade under anymore.  I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  If you concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get attached for online trading. 
 ? 
 I noticed the memo too, and looked around this morning for the attachments that went with them, but couldn't find them.  When Mark calls in I'll ask him what happened to the attachments. 
 Per my conv. w/Tanya, the above master should be inactived (which I have already done in Lotus Notes) and taken off the executed Master List.  All the Dynegy Trading is done out of Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  Thanks. 
 Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.  Is there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the middle of it.  We've all lost our common sense and direction.  It sure makes for good TV, though!  I sat all last night flipping from news station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.  I can't say I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.  I've been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party system.  That was a good thought.    Peter Keohane 11/09/2000 04:37 PM 
 Dear Mr. Dune,  At the request of Dovie Keprta, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  I have also enclosed a blacklined draft showing the changes from the NDA you executed with Enron Broadband.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have an authorized officer execute two copies and return them to me for execution by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399. 
 It's just you and me tomorrow.  Soma is having furniture delivered from Star and they said they could only come between 8-12.  So shall we drive together?  Do you want to come to my house?  At what time?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 11/09/2000 04:53 PM 
 Per our conv., above counterparty is OK to trade all products (except the usual credit deriv. & Argentina Gas). 
 The scary thing about those old goats being too blind to vote is that they're still driving!    Jon Chapman 11/10/2000 03:39 AM 
 Sounds good to me.  I'll see you tomorrow am!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 11/10/2000 11:44 AM 
 Rick Borden at Macleod Dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents on the prepay.  Can you send him a copy?  Also, when they're all together, can you send a copy to me for our files.  Thanks! 
 We have completed the revisions to anexb.doc (the document used to prepare credit for omnibus confirmations).  It has been moved into the attorney forms bank and is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/anexb.doc.  The prior form has been moved to atty.fms/swaps/old forms/oldanexb.doc. 
 At the request of Paul Finken, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please mail or fax an executed copy to me.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.  My fax number is (713) 636-3490. 
 Michael, thought you might enjoy this! 
 Here's another spin on the election ballot! 
 Just a note that the new bandwidth is still in EBS Legal being run thru the legal and regulatory hoops.  As soon as I hear from Robbi or Marie that it's approved, I'll pass on the word. 
 I sent Scott Sefton and email and he responded that at this time he doesn't know the exact Brits that will be coming for the conference, he expects 6-8. I think we should order 8 mens shirts in large.  So I don't think you need to email him or Michael Brown.  Thanks for your help! 
 Attached is that chart that were supposed to replace with the current one on price volatility.  I tried to open it up, but it was all gobbeldy gook. Maybe you could print it out for me and then I could take a look at it and if it looks OK we could just replace it with existing one.  Thanks! 
 NYMEX is trying to get more competitive... 
 Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of "Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we are trying to carve those transactions out.  Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 11/13/2000 10:09 AM 
 I forwarded your agreement to Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group, and she would prefer to work from our form if possible.  Let me know if this is a problem.    "John Nugent" <jnugent@purchasepooling.com> 11/10/2000 03:06 PM Please respond to jnugent 
 Jennifer McQuade with EOL called checking on the status of your conv. w/Elzear Lemieux with cpy.  Have you resolved the ETA questions yet? 
 I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause any problems...    Greg Johnston 11/10/2000 11:20 AM 
 At the request of Dovie Keprta in our eMarket Services Group, I am enclosing a draft of our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement for David Endicott's review.

Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Leslie Hansen, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments you might have.  We look forward to hearing from you.

 Attached is a current list of the NDA's I am working on for the EOL and Net Works teams.  Please take the time to look at this list and confirm the status of any NDA's you are interested in. 
 My favorite election comment to date comes from Gore who said today he was not "focused on the contest, but our democracy".  Such a thoughtful, selfless person! 
 For this list of amends, my comments mean:  Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should have no impact on my prior approvals. Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas) Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's changes. 
 Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.  We have a note in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 4/6/2000.  Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name change.  Thanks.    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/10/2000 09:25 AM 
 Your call to Mark Taylor in Houston Legal was forwarded to me for response. Mark is on vacation in Germany until the end of next week.  Per your voicemail, you has some US market descriptions that you need to have reviewed.  I just left Mark a voicemail on his cell phone, I'm not sure if I will hear from him tonight or not.  If youcould email or fax me the document/information you need reviewed, I will run it by Mark as soon as I hear back from him.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help for the immediate moment, but I will respond as soon as I hear from Mark. 
 I'll leave you a check tomorrow.  Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to meet the stove repair guy.  Can you meet me there to do house & yard clean up day?    "Louis Fernandez Co." <lofeco@ev1.net> 11/14/2000 09:08 AM 
 The big switch here is that we're shutting Public Service Electric and Gas Commpany for power.  All their power will be traded out of PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC. 
 Perfect, it had another meeting scheduled for 3:30 I had to attend!    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/14/2000 09:24 AM 
 Can you email me your form?  How about lunch today?    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/14/2000 09:31 AM 
 Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services Company?  If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial master executed under Calpine Power Services.  Can you fax it to me at 713/636-3490.  Thanks!    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/10/2000 10:01 AM 
 You are the best!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/14/2000 09:59 AM 
 If we both agree that the counterparty should now be RAG Coal Sales of America, shouldn't your spreadsheet reflect that name?  I'm confused.    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/14/2000 09:57 AM 
 So, back to my original question, is this a name change? 
 I will be taking Friday p.m. off to meet stove repair guy & contractor. 
 Yeah!  Also, I spoke to Dalzenia and she is going to move that dirt around by the fence.    "Louis Fernandez Co." <lofeco@ev1.net> 11/14/2000 10:21 AM 
 Per a call from Rod today, our executed master list hasn't picked up the following name change:  Lomak Petroleum Inc. to Range Resources Corporation.  Thanks! 
 Can you fax me the merger documents to 646-3490.  Thanks! 
 Anyone have these merger docs? 
 But I did respond.  I said "yeah!" on the thermostat.  You're confusing me...I don't know where Michelle is.  She should be in town.  She must just be busy at work.    "Louis Fernandez Co." <lofeco@ev1.net> 11/14/2000 01:32 PM 
 Now don't be afraid to tell us what you really think...!    Peter Keohane 11/14/2000 12:35 PM 
 As you requested, to clear up any confusion regarding the responsibilities of the paralegals in the financial trading group:  We have four paralegals, myself, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie Panus.  Marie Heard is no longer is our group, she works for Enron Broadband.  Below are responsibilities of the paralegals in our group:  Tana Jones:  Primarily all EnronOnline issues.  (1) I am the primary Legal contact for counterparty approvals for all Legal Groups.  Individual contract problems should be sorted out with the relevant Legal group (i.e. physical gas, power, etc.) the same way as they would be resolved offline.  (2) As my time allows, I try and help on ISDA negotiations, so if you see a master with my name on, feel free to call me.  Day to Day Financial Contract Drafting and Questions:  Can be directed to any of Susan, Samantha, or Stephanie.  Copies of Executed Masters:  Call our assistant, Taffy Milligan at x57373, she can get you copies.  Merger/Name Changes:  Stephanie Panus  Executed Master List:  Susan Bailey  I hope this straightens things out! 
 OK for me! 
 OK for me! 
 This Counterparty is on the 11/9/00 EOL List.  We have received documentation that reflects that Calpine Power Services Company, an entity where we have an ISDA Master in place, has merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., an entity where we don't have an ISDA in place with.   Is Credit OK with this merger? 
 I am sending down this list, with all counterparties approved except Calpine, which I am still waiting on Credit approval on the Calpine Power Services/Energy Services merger.  As soon as I get their sign off I will send down an amended spreadsheet. 
 Pursuant to the Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State effective 11/1/00, Calpine Power Services Company, a California corporation has been merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., a Delaware corporation.  The ISDA Master Agreement with Calpine Power Services Company dated 10/20/99 will be changed accordingly. 
 Attached is the Annex B for Catalytica. 
 Nope, it's a merger.    Tanya Rohauer 11/14/2000 03:35 PM

 I just can't help myself!  - DemBallot.gif 
 I believe that this was authored by James Carville:   NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach.  "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."  One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. "The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the Mets batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely."Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.  "It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said  a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.  He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment." 
 Attached is the revised list giving Calpine Energy Services the same approval as Calpine Power Services (except no Argentina gas). 
 Per the request of Sara, I am attaching Annex A and Annex B to the Omnibus Confirmation for the referenced counterparty. 
 Bandwidth now OK per Marie.  She should have GTC to you no later than noon tomorrow.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:08 PM 
 No, we don't currently have Alberta Prepay docs.  Greg has finally gotten them all and is preparing sets.

 Per Mark's request, can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross numbers to match my list:  "Net long or short position in all months combined" should be the net of our aggregate position, and "Gross Long or Short Position" should be our gross position on either side of the market, with the positions not netted out. 
 At the request of Mark Taylor, can you get Sara Shackleton and Brent Hendry passwords too so they can review the Dynegydirect GTC's.  P.S.  Do we have any particular deadline for getting them approved?  Thanks!     Stephanie Sever 11/15/2000 10:02 AM 
 You guys crack me up!    Peter Keohane 11/15/2000 10:50 AM 
 Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our Legal sign off by Friday.  I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper description for our group.  Thanks for your help!

 Heck, we all know sending an agreement out for signature doesn't mean getting them back signed.  If we had every agreement signed we sent out, we'd be at 1000!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/15/2000 04:12 PM 
 Awais,  I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.  When can I expect the remaining descriptions? 
 Jay, this one is from one of our London lawyers to me and a Canadian lawyer. 
 These last two were especially good.  I guess the best thing about this mess is that it has provoked such good humor!    Jon Chapman 11/16/2000 05:20 AM 
 You guys are cracking me up.  I had tears streaming down my face this morning!  (hey, but I thought y'all played "American Football" too, maybe I'm confused).    Peter Keohane 11/16/2000 09:50 AM 
 At the request of Leslie Hansen, I am enclosing a clean and redlined draft of the revised NDA. 
 Yes! 
 We have received the fully executed Confidential Nondisclosure Agreement dated 11/13/00 between Sapient Corporation and Enron Net works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Can you please direct one of the paralegals to assist Angeline with getting this documentation in place.  I thought Susan would be appropriate because she handles internal masters, but I understand she is only responsible for RMT Masters. 
 I told the online people I had to shut them down for power because we didn't have them on any FERC lists.  Below is their ph. # (when you get a minute!). 
 I have passed your request to Mark Taylor to assign to another paralegal.  I no longer handle the day to day swap work, I am working on Online predominately now.  By copy of this email, I will ask Mark to let you know what paralegal he has assigned this to.    Angeline Poon 11/15/2000 03:25 AM

 This counterparty is approved for all products except power and Argentina gas (no credit deriv too).

The following will constitute an additional Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a):  (ix) (i) in the case of Party A, if Enron Corp. ceases to own, directly or indirectly, one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Party A having ordinary voting power; or (ii) in the case of Party B, if Enron Corp. ceases to own directly or indirectly, one hundred percent (100%) or more of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Party B having ordinary voting power. 
 We only send this to the legal team that follows, not the distribution that Brad sends it to. 
 Attached is Annex A for the Omnibus, revised only to change "ECT" to "ENA". 
 What do you think? 
 On First Energy, we originally had them open for financial and shut down for power, no change to that earlier approval. 
 I thought this might be helpful. 
 Thanks Justy, you're the best!    Justin Boyd 11/17/2000 02:33 AM 
 All the counterparties below can trade physical, and only the two I've marked below in red can trade financial.    Camille Gerard@ENRON 11/17/2000 09:29 AM 
 Just a reminder, starting today until I get back after the holidays, send the counterparty approval lists to my assistant Taffy Milligan, and she will forward them to the Legal team, so they can be working on their approvals while I'm gone. 
 You are right.  They need to get the date on their calendars, and pass it on to anyone they might think is coming. 
 Per your request, I am attaching the Executed Masters List.  Please feel free to call me anytime I can be of help! 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated 11/15/00 between the referenced Counterparty and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement dated 11/20/00 between the referencec Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 FYI 
 Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database. Please note, that we have recently upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.  Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I will forward it to them. 
 With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue.  With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.    Denis O'Connell 11/22/2000 06:05 AM 
 Can you please give Greg Johnston, Peter Keohane and Mark Powell, lawyers in our Calgary office, as well as their assistants Linda Sietzema and Sharon Crawford,  full edit access to the Financial Trading Agreements database. Can you please let me know when their access has been granted.  Thanks! 
 Per our discussion, the email for that website is www.utilityconnection.com. 
 Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.  Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you about potential metals customers?  Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?  Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him? 
 As usual, you're the best!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 05:10 PM 
 On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).  It helps me and some of the non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..  Thanks! 
 On Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Credit wants to open them up for power, but Leslie's records are showing they are not a FERC approved marketer.  If we want to open them for power, we're going to need the name and phone number of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their FERC status.  For HS Energy Services, no change to my prior approval, which would have them open for all financial except Australian power.  (Also, shutting down Argentina gas...) 
 This link should be ok.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 11/28/2000 09:38 AM 
 Thanks Lisa!    Lisa Lees 11/28/2000 10:07 AM 
 FYI 
 Not wanting to duplicate any efforts, I think Laurie Meyer, a paralegal in Alan Aronowitz's group, is going to send me copies of the Australian ISDA's when they come in.  Thanks for the offer!    Jana Morse@ENRON 11/20/2000 11:01 AM 
 Mark,  There has never been a time in our Group before where any member of our Group was cut off from mass distributions that were sent to all of our client base and member of the Group but me.  If the intent is to cut me off and make me feel isolated from the Group and my friends, clients and customers and associates it is working! 
 I don't know who is going to work on this one, but I just wanted to remind you that we had that big file with lots of due diligence on the TVA... 
 I was just speaking to Ed Sacks, and he asked if we could add a new Credit person to our distribution lists, Wendy Conwell, who will be working with Ed on the power counterparties.  Her ext. is 30699. 
 I checked with Sara, and Thursday at 2:30 pm is OK with us.  Just let us know if the time changes.  Should we come to Bill's office? 
 Matt,  Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have (like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):  Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals) Weather Derivatives Credit Derivatives  Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products we trade.  Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.    Thanks! 
 Thanks for the heads up.  Let me know when you need help...    Sara Shackleton 11/28/2000 04:34 PM 
 My copy had redlines.  I passed the comments on to Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our Group for review.    Bruce Harris@ENRON 11/28/2000 05:20 PM 
 Sara, is there a reason I'm being sent this?    Angela Davis@ENRON 11/29/2000 08:54 AM 
 Will do.  Thanks for the heads up!    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/28/2000 07:54 PM 
 Matt,  As you may or may not know, I am the liason in Houston between the Online Team and Legal, coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all products.  I am asking because until recently I have not been approving Singapore counterparties to trade any financial products.  It has been my understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading physical products.  I can continue my practice of not opening Singapore incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until I get a real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial.  Should that be my continuing practice?    Matthias Lee 11/28/2000 07:38 PM 
 Ditto as to my feelings of isolation and punishment. 
 I've made my flight reservations home for XMAS, and they should only have me out Friday, Dec. 22.  My flight returns very early on the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 27, so if there are no delays I should be in the office late sometime that morning. 
 Will do!    Paul Finken@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/29/2000 10:29 AM 
 Can you please add my assistant, Taffy Milligan, on for full edit access to the referenced database.  Can you also delete Shari Stack from edit capability, as she is no longer in our group.  Also, can you provide me a list of the individuals with full edit access.  I need to check to see if there are other people that have left our group or legal and credit that should be taken off.  Thanks! 
 Hey, Mr. Computer, you can't log an email in to your sister?!    Kyle.Jones@radianz.com 11/17/2000 12:00 PM 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement dated 11/29/00 with the referenced counterparty.  A copy will be provided to Dovie. 
 I just spoke to Tanya and she was going for either (1) Bloomberg published a report that said energy supply was going to be low for the next couple of years, or (2) the California thing.  She hadn't heard the Energizer bunny story. 
 Just an update, Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, will be working on the Confirmation, her direct no. is x34737, and Stephanie Panus, another paralegal in our group, will be working on the ISDA Master, her no is x53249.  When you have that address and contact information ready for the counterparty, why don't you email it directly to Stephanie.  If I can be of further help, just let me know! 
 No problem, always happy to help!    Paul Finken@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/29/2000 04:24 PM 
 Please note:  we are intermediary on a deal we are structuring between Interliant and PurchasePooling, so we have added them as a party to receive the confidential information.  If you work off this form you would, of course, want to strike the reference to PurchasePooling in Paragraph 5. 
 If possible, can we hold this meeting until Mark gets back.  I think Mark's input is the most important. 
 It was good to hear from you!  We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise.  It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called "African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging. It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands!).  I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby.  I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs "guest suite" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy.  As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us.  But, I guess, it's a start...  I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!     Kyle.Jones@radianz.com 11/29/2000 05:07 PM 
 You can take my assistant Taffy Milligan off these emails again.  Thanks!    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/29/2000 04:49 PM 
 Attached is the referenced agreement.  Let me know if the notice information is OK with you.  If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring it to you for countersignature.  Thinking about that, what's your title?  I'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority... 
 No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement.   Our concern is that we don't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component.    Richard Sage 11/30/2000 10:52 AM 
 I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we're OK.    Sheri Thomas 11/30/2000 10:27 AM 
 The referenced counterparty has applied in London for a password application.  Can you let me know if this presents any problems for each of your trading groups products?  Thanks! 
 FYI, I understand from our natural gas people that they do not like the EnergyGateway form of GTC and want to transact on their platform with only counterparties where we have a master agreement in place. 
 I've got some changes to make to that assignment and then I'm ready to send it to them.  Do you have a contact for me to send it to?    Melissa Ann Murphy 11/30/2000 11:06 AM 
 Will the LME transactions go under a relevant financial master, if any, or will they always be standalone under the GTC? 
 Per the request of Bill Bradford, I am attaching our standard Material Adverse Change clauses. 
 Anthony,  We have Confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other parties, including, other Enron affiliates.  All requests by non-Enron North America employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to the paralegals in the Swap Group to determine if the agreement will allow us to provide copies to such affiliate, or whether we would  need counterparty approval to do so.  With respect to the agreements listed below, I will take a look at those and let you know whether they present any problem.  Andrew Wells 11/30/2000 03:00 PM 
 Thanks, I'll fax it over to her today!    Melissa Ann Murphy 11/30/2000 03:27 PM 
 Does Dr. Batsell's company have a name?    Kal Shah 11/30/2000 03:18 PM 
 FYI,  Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.  He also discussed  proposed credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in place (including EnronCredit.com).  I think we are done now and hope to get execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.  Our intention is to then get Deutsche Bank to turn around 3 like masters, making any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the remaining masters quickly.  I'll keep you posted.    Richard Sage 11/30/2000 10:52 AM 
 We're going to have a Legal happy hour tomorrow at the Blue Agave, and it would be no party without you there.  Hope you can make it (and ask any of your buddies in Legal you want to ask!). 
 Please forward this to 70 of your closest friends... 
 We do have a Credit Support Annex in place.  Once we sign the ENA agreement, we will make your requests to DB.    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 12/05/2000 06:08 AM 
 On your counterparty list for the UK, have you identified which counterparties are utilities or governmentals?  If you have that would help me alot.  Thanks! 
 Another good one! 
 Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a "governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All other US products appear to be OK. 
 It was making me sleepy just looking at it!    Genia FitzGerald 12/05/2000 10:41 AM 
 See if this works... 
 We have received the following fully executed documents back from EnergyGateway:  1.  Provider Agreement dated 12/04/00.  This Agreement provides that the Monthly Membership Fee of $1,500 shall be waived for the first six months of the contract, starting November 30, 2000 thru May 31, 2001.  2.  Natural Gas Marketplace General Terms and Conditions dated 11/30/00.  A copy will be sent to Sheri Thomas and Craig Breslau. 
 A woman named Janette Bertel at McLaren Energy just left a message for Genia who had just sent them a power master, that they also want to get an ISDA Master in place with us.  The woman's phone no is 819/986-4616.  If you could send up some credit for this, we'd appreciate it! 
 The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 12/05/2000 08:41 AM 
 For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements. Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).  Unlike the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, Team Swap is looking strong. 
 Bob,  Per your request, attached are the online trading GTC's.  It looks like Mark has all of them, not just financial.  I'm going to talk to Stacy about this when she gets in, because I know she was talking about adding it in.  I'll get back to you. 
 My strategy on hand recounts, is that if if the opposition wants one, they'll have to do it themselves!      Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/05/2000 04:14 PM 
 Justin & Matt,  Beth Cowan is a member here of the EnronOnline Marketing Team.  Her Counterparty, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, would like to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ECTRIC (per Beth, they don't like our form of GTC).  We already have a Local Currency form in place with ENA, but obviously, that would not be an appropriate form for London to use.  It is also on our form of Schedule from 1996, which we wouldn't want to work off of either.  In addition, I've checked the Confidentiality Provisions, and they do not have affiliate language in that would allow me to provide a copy of the agreement to you w/o counterparty's consent.  Saying all that, could you please help Beth out... 
 Who is Robert Mcgrory?  Is he a member of the Legal Dept? 
 With respect to your request:  1.  I take it "ECTRL" is the Master Agreement between ECTRIC and ENA.  All the internal masters are kept in Houston.  I will send you a copy. 2.  Moravske Naftove is an agreement that London Legal got in place.  We do not have copies here, I suggest you contact Matt Dawson to get a copy. 3.  Risk Mangement & Trading/ECTRIC-I will send you a copy. 4.  State Street Bank, as Trustee/ECTRIC-this was for the Cash VI Project and is not for general trading purposes.  I will send copies to you. 5.  Elf Trading S.A./ECTRIC-London Legal should have copies.  Contact Matt Dawson    Andrew Wells 11/30/2000 03:00 PM 
 At the request of George Zivic, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please call me at 713/853-3399 or Leslie Hansen, Senior Counsel, at 713/835-6121 if you have any comments or questions. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing a copy of our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399, or email me your comments. 
 The meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm to discuss netting between the physical and financial contracts will be held in Bill Bradford's office. 
 Matt and Denis,  Can you help us with this NDA we need executed for an EnronCredit. meeting on Monday?  If you could print it out on EnronCredit.com letterhead and have Denis initial it for signature.  Because of time, Leslie can't initial this before we execute it, but we promise she will initial it before we send it out to the customer.  Then, can you have it executed by an officer of EnronCredit.com and return it to me at fax nol 713/646-3490.  Thanks for your help! 
 Here are the next four descriptions.  Per Awais's message below, he is still trying to get these by today.  I know it is a little late....let me know if this will be an issue.  Please give me your comments so I can coordinate responses.  Thanks! 
 I see you two are on the Reliant agreement.  Deedy Russo, who is manager of contracts at Reliant, asked if we could contact them about getting an ISDA Master in place to replace the old ERMS Agreement.  She siad we should contact Janna Lynn Galloway, a paralegal there.  Her number is 713/207-5893. 
 It is in Mark Taylor's hands.  Unfortunately, he is out sicke    Dawn C Kenne 12/07/2000 02:03 PM 
 This is a Mark Taylor Question. 
 We have received an executed copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between Analytica, Inc. and Enron Net Works, LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels and Kal Shah. 
 We have lots of ISDA's in place with "Southerns", "Southern" who?    Chris Gaffney 12/08/2000 09:09 AM 
 We have an ISDA Master Agreement (Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction) in place with between ENA and Southern Company Energy Marketing L.P.  I am a little concerned if Canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the Services Agreement.  Being a Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction form, it does not have tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade. If you would like to do trades under this, we might want to consider amending it to add the necessary provisions, adding the provisions into the confirmation, or replacing it with a Multicurrency Agreement.    Chris Gaffney 12/08/2000 09:24 AM 
 Any thoughts on how you would like to approach this? 
 Mark Taylor has asked me to forward to the relevant attorneys the following market descriptions.  Obviously, for you, the weather one is yours, I sent the pulp & paper to Sara.  We need to review the market descriptions from a legal perspective only.  Awais is trying to get them back by today.  Let me know if that will present a problem.   He still hasn't got the liquids ones written, he says we'll have those by Monday.  I am coordinating the responses, so please return any comments you might have to me for transmittal to Awais.  Thanks for your help! 
 I would like to amend my earlier approval with respect to the ISDA Master Agreement we recently executed with this Counterparty to limit their financial trading to energy commodity trading only.  This counterparty is NOT approved to trade any other products including , but not limited to, weather, pulp & paper, plastics, steel, metals, interest rate & currency, fx, or credit derivatives. 
 I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar to our FERC licensing.  Thanks! 
 So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm. Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.  I think it would be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions. Dinner sounds good to me....    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 12/08/2000 04:32 PM 
 Oops, already had to make change! 
 Can she get it wrong twice within 1 minute?  The answer is YES! 
 For the two amended counterparties listed, I have amended-no change, because neither was approved for physical power or financial trading, and I do not want that to change.  I don't care about Credit opening them up or shutting them down for physical gas. 
 Are you there.  I tried calling and no one picked up.  I'm ready to go...    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 12/08/2000 05:03 PM 
 ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power L.P.  Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.  Could the trades be done under that master?  Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in place.       Jan Wilson 12/11/2000 07:26 AM 
 I haven't done anything.  I was waiting for you to get back in to discuss this...    Sara Shackleton 12/11/2000 08:16 AM 
 Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill today about 3:30 pm our time.  I have the originals and asked her to tell me what address she wants me to send the originals to.  I didn't date the front page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.  I'm working on getting the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same package, maybe tomorrow.   I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do. 
 The MAC clauses are attached to the ISDA Master Agreement.  I will have a sample copy walked down to you. 
 My new address is:  1920 Banks St., Houston  77098.  I would love to come to your dinner party!    Mary Cook 12/11/2000 08:38 AM 
 Yep, we had a nice time.  I tried calling you about 4:00 yesterday, but there was no answer, so I figured you didn't want to go.    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 12/11/2000 10:53 AM 
 What's the scoop on getting this signed? 
 Thanks!    Stephanie Sever 12/11/2000 11:14 AM 
 I sent you the regular online approval by mistake.  Below are clickpaper. 
 Per our conversation.  1.  Replace front outdoor light fixture. 2.  Add door numbers to bottom of front door (1920 Banks). 3.  Add door knocker to middle of front  door (cute kitty door knocker!). 4.  Replace light in front sunroom with new light. 5.  Fix window in back sunroom so it locks or closes (I'm afraid it would be easy to pry open, and we have had recent robberies in neighborhood). 
 Attached is another NDA we need to get signed ASAP.  If you could help us with this, we'd appreciate it! 
 Sure, I'll take care of it!    Sara Shackleton 12/11/2000 03:06 PM 
 The referenced Counterparty wants to trade physical power.  Leslie has signed off on them from a Legal standpoint, but Credit still has concerns and has assigned them no power headroom.  I spoke to Jeff Mansfield in their Legal Dept. and he is going to have his Credit guy call Ed Sacks tomorrow. 
 Tana will attend.    Sheri L Cromwell 12/11/2000 04:45 PM 
 I have no idea if it was or not.  Would you like to pass it on, or do you want me to?  Does he know what's going on? 
 With respect to the trade done today with Gases y Graneles Liquidos S.A., please find attached a Chilean Annex A for an Omnibus form of confirmation. Please attach this form and make an election for NY law as the choice of law.  Along with the fax of the Confirmation to the Counterparty, please also fax a form of IRS Form W-8BEN and ask the Counterparty to complete the form and return it to us.  Craig, can you talk to the Counterparty and make sure they send us back the tax form?! 
 Per the email below, this has been approved.  I had to revise the attached copy to fix the header and page break, so use the copy I sent you.  Thanks for your help! 
 Can I sent a copy of this down to Credit?  How about Joe Hunter?    Mark Taylor 12/12/2000 09:08 AM 
 As we discussed, I am attaching our proposed form of Bilateral and Enron Protected Party Non-Disclosure Agreements.  Please direct any comments you may have to Mark Greenberg at x58897.  We appreciate your help with this! 
 I would, I will contribute $25.  I have to walk over to the bank to get some cash.    Sheri L Cromwell 12/12/2000 11:53 AM 
 fyi- 
 Awais  Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster to this effect. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing a clean and redlined copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement revised to include your comment.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have the agreement executed and return a copy to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron and return a copy to you via fax. 
 Whatever Tom decides to mirror these two new products from, ditto from me!    Lisa Lees 12/12/2000 01:56 PM 
 Ditto Tom.    Lisa Lees 12/12/2000 02:36 PM 
 Ditto Tom.    Lisa Lees 12/12/2000 02:40 PM 
 Attached is my proposed form of Amendment, which would delete the old style "ERMS" Collateral Annex and replace it with an ISDA Credit Support Annex. Tanya, please take a look at the stairstep, and the segregation of collateral provisions. 
 Sure!    Lora Sullivan@ENRON 12/13/2000 09:19 AM 
 Can you please send me a copy of the fully executed NDA for our files. Thanks! 
 You can come up to our area here on 38 and reveiw any contracts you would like.  We are located directly in front on the glass doors on 38.    Carrie Richardson@ENRON 12/13/2000 10:32 AM 
 Steve, I don't know if we are duplicating your effort, but our ECT lawyers here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions, so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business groups for approval.  If we are duplicating your work, or doing something contrary to what we should be doing, please call me or Jeff and we will try to coordinate our responses.  Otherwise, we will continue the review we are doing. 
 Taffy, can you please copy these masters for Carrie ASAP.  Thanks. 
 I just left you both another message about this NDA.  Their lawyer is calling from NY, and we need it signed now.  His name is Robert Harris, his ph is 212/984-9112 and his fax is 212/984-9111. 
 Matthew Dawson 12/13/2000 12:33 PM 
 Did you draft this? 
 Attached is the UK form of ISDA Schedule which should have the UK choice of law and arbitration language in it.  I send it with a caveat that this draft is 2 years old.  The London lawyers were gone by the time I got your call, so I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt Dawson, I am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the choice of law or arbitration language. 
 Derek,  I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch. 
 Susan Bailey in our Group sends out this list.  Your should direct your request to her.  Thanks!    Stacey Vallejo 12/13/2000 02:30 PM 
 Please find attached our proposed Second Amendment, which would replace the current form of collateral annex attached to the ISDA Master Agreement we have in place with an ISDA Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto.  If you have any questions or comments concerning the form please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-5620.  Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Dept. can handle any credit questions you have.  Her number is (713) 853-3263.  Thanks for your prompt attention to this. 
 With respect to Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Company, a Bermuda company, although they are being sent thru to specifically open them for weather, Brent Hendry says I can't open them up until we review their Memorandum of Association (like their articles of incorporation) to confirm that nothing in them would prohibit this type of transaction.  Can you contact whomever sent you the Password Application and ask them to fax their Memorandum of Association to us.  Thanks!

 Here's the final liquids descriptions! 
 At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any comments or questions. 
 Attached please find Annex B for Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund deals nos. QD7357.1 and QE0910.2. 
 Alan, is this what you are talking about?  I forwarded your voicemail on to Mark T. 
 Attached are the revised descriptions for SO2 and NOX.  Jeff Hodge signed off on the Canada description and said it looked fine in its current form.  I will be faxing you this evening our comments to Natural Gas.  You should have received weather by separate email from Shari Stack.  Coal should be coming shortly, paper is being looked at by the business people and we will have it to you on Tuesday.  The person responsible for power is out of the office, but will be back in town on Tuesday, and we will get you her comments then. Thank you for your kind patience. 
 FYI 
 I will be attending the online presentation today at 4. 
 We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX for 1999.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary Companies.  My last list was dated June 8, 1998.  Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help! 
 Here's coal.  That just leaves power and any revisions to pulp & paper we may get from the business people. 
 I will have the master walked down to you shortly. 
 Thursday's OK with me. 
 Awais,  I think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney in our group, Shari Stack.  If that is the one you are talking about, it should be okay.   I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling Steve Kean and see if I get a response. 
 Shari, Can you take a look at this revised market description and let me know if its ok.  Thanks. 
 I spoke to Steve Kean's assistant, and told her your deadline to get all these descriptions done was the end of today.  She said she would pass the word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day.  Let me know if that doesn't happen. 
 Either day is fine for me. 
 De nada! 
 I guess I still need your market descriptions for LPG, Oil & Oil Products and Plastics and Petrochem.  Will I have them by the end of the day? 
 Thanks Shari! 
 Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.  My goal is to get everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve before I have to file by June 11th.  When the financials are ready I need to get them certified by the highest accounting officer.  Last year that was Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting. Will he be signing again? 
 I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.  Steve Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.  Not as to legal.  He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her comments to me for forwarding to you.  I will let you know as soon as I receive your comments. 
 Were you serious about our conversation Friday, or were you kidding me?  If you were serious I'd like to talk to you about it. 
 After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received it.  With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me with this?  Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract numbers for our financial masters?  Thanks! 
 Below is the memo from ISDA that needs to be read in conjunction with that Master Netting Agreement. 
 Here are the descriptions again. 
 Taffy, you were going to check on how much vacation days I have left.  I wanted to take a few days when my mom comes in for XMAS.  Thanks. 
 I checked around and that is the most recent copy we have.  If I can be of any help whatsoever, let me know! 
 How about Thursday, next week? 
 I got Edward's markup of the description, and wanted to run it by you when you have a minute.  Let me know... 
 Thanks for your help! 
 One personal day this monday. 
 Thanks Bob.  The couch is always open, tho' (obviously!) not always helpful! 
 List looks good to me! 
 I didn't know you sent the market description to Awais, so I was following up.  I'll mark it out. 
 Here are your three remaining descriptions.  Please note that Harry has asked that Mark Taylor review the plastics description.  Mark is out of the office and will not return until Monday. 
 Awais, I sent you all these.  What happened to them! 
 All the descriptions except weather have already been emailed to Awais and I have asked him to provide them to you.  I understand you have weather which was faxed. 
 Mike,  You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and that appears not to have happened yet.  Can you please let me and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.  Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.  Brent, can you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals (Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.  Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a document tracking database in B.A.  Who should he contact here to get a new database created similar to ours?  Thanks for your help! 
 Brent,  I have asked several times to get you access to Lotus Notes.  If we don't get you access in response to this latest email, we may need to kick it higher.  Hope you are doing well...we miss you! 
 I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our meeting.  I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and haven't heard.  In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360 days.  So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like to change that to 365/366 accross the board.  I asked them if there was any specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's the custom in the bank/dealer markets.  Anyway, I'd like to get that answered. 
 That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.  I have attached the proposed form of confirmation.  I have combined in it the usual tax language we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company (Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through non-U.S. branches (England).  Please let me know if the tax language meets with your approval. 
 Brent,  I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement database and using it for your contract applications.  It is my hope to use it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to developing a similar system for you. 
 I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP issues. 
 We have added the new One Way, Cash and Letter of Credit Collateral Annex to the back of the Industrial Master.  It is still located in my form directory, called industrial-u.s.#5.doc. 
 I'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today.  We really do have a problem getting responses from our computer people, so I hope a relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response. 
 It's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the latest.  Mark thought London may have made some additional changes.  Can you email me the latest draft.  Thanks! 
 Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT Canada that went into bankruptcy.  It shows up on my list because I'm working off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.  I just want to make sure that we don't send them any mailouts. 
 Just checking to get a status report on your offsite.  I hope there was no frivolity or frolickling had by anyone...! 
 I've found a great website to check on utilities (trying to figure out if a counterparty is one, or whether its a governmental one).  It's at www.utilityconnection.com.  It even has non-U.S. utilities.  When you have a minute, give it a look. 
 Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks! 
 Here are the descriptions for power. 
 I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp. "signing" the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.   Actually what Utilicorp. did in this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 of the agreement).  They signed accepting joint and several liability with respect to the obligations.   If we can get them to agree to the same language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better than getting a guaranty.   Anything less (like just sticking their "name" on the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.  All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.  Let me know if I can be of further service... 
 Sent again. 
 Sign off on Canada. 
 It turns out that Jeff Hodge made plane reservations for 1:30 pm on Wednesday.  Can we move that meeting up to 11:00 am? 
 We have dinner reservations for Saturday at 7:30.  Reservation #189. 
 I will be able to attend. 
 Access to the online trading system?  If that's the questions, probably none of us. 
 There will be a demonstration of the Online Trading Application for trading lawyers and paralegals on Wednesday at 11:00 am in EB2601a.  This project continues to be highly confidential. 
 For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it sounds like a utility or governmental.  Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me? 
 Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the counterparty.  Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of incorporation of the counterparty.  I will not assign the review of Italian law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.  If you feel we need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start looking at it. 
 Per the notes below, Jeff Hodge signed off on the description Awais sent us with no changes.  NOX and SOX are attached also. 
 I am also reforwarding the coal description. 
 FYI 
 I noticed we have 2 entries for cpy in Lotus Notes.  We need to delete one. 
 Mark,  David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not so sure it's correct.  We think it should reflect two huge power price spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.  We don't think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes.  Can you take a look at it and get back to me...thanks for your help! 
 Per the meeting today, attached is the latest counterparty list in Excel. 
 Just a note to make sure that I get any updates to the approved Counterparty list.  I will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's approved counterparty list here in Houston. 
 Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.  The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information. You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell. 
 I am going to meet with Tom at 3:30 (after our ice cream social at 3:00) to go over my latest list of questions to the 2nd credit list, so how's about discussing any other financial issues we might have then... 
 I gave Shari my whole file on Canadian cash collateral issues to look at. You may want to get it from her.  It has Fred Erickson's phone # in there also. 
 Scott, one of our crude oil traders passed on the attached resume of one of his friends and asked if we could take a look at it.  I gave it to Mark Taylor and since the fellow lives in England he thought it would be better sent to you. 
 Unfortunately, providing Matt with the ISDA Master is a problem.  It's got the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell us, Enron North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT International).  Sorry... 
 I'm a little confused.  Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3) both? 
 I have added Shari's MAC clause (when there is no collateral annex and MAC is an additional event of default) as an alternative in the MAC clauses for the ISDA Master Agreement contained in ISDAexh.doc. 
 Yes, I put together a package of stuff and sent it to you.  I don't know how long mail takes to get there.  It will probably be there I hope in today's mail. 
 I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement database.  I understand that you are the person that can get them access.  This will continue to be an issue as we expand our trading offices around the world.  Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent and Andrea access.  Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.  How does Brent go about getting this new database created?  Thanks for your help! 
 Carol made some proposed changes to the MAC language and asked me to send it to you to get your input. 
 Mary, although this presentation is for the Legal Dept. I thought maybe if you have a representative from your group there it might be helpful.  Do you have someone, like Mary Gosnell, that you would like to attend?  Let me know, and I'll get their name added to the list. 
 Have you sent these to Steve Kean? 
 The Legal/Credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 1/2 hour until 2:30 pm. 
 If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.  We're always looking for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!  How are you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well as others...! 
 We do not have a copy of the executed agreement for our files.  Can you have one of your assistant's copy it for me as well as any relevant guarantees, credit support documents, etc.  Much thanks... 
 Well, it turns out that Mark Elliott needs a revised draft of the UK ISDA incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to Gibraltar counsel for the legal review he's working on for Gibraltar law.  So, I'll work with Mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the London legal team for approval. 
 Thanks for the material.  I've been really busy at work.  At some point when I have more of a break I'll call you. 
 Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English culture, the Morris Men.  I've got their website bookmarked.  Y'all are a goofy bunch.  Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with switches.  It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English culture to me.  I am constantly amused!  If y'all would only cheer at marathons...! 
 Shouldn't we be setting a time for a form meeting so we can review those documents (Deemed ISDA, legal opinions, etc.) I distributed a while back? 
 That may not be so easy an answer.  I think we would have to talk to Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies. Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and we'll give them a call. 
 Here's that email....! 
 I'm working with Mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online trading.  Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.  Should Singapore be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?  Are there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the governmentals, such as the utilites?  Are there any products that might not be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others? Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our agreements?  Any guidance you could give us with this would be most appreciated!  How are you and the baby doing?  We hope to see pictures on your next trip over! 
 Thank you for the lunch invite.  I put on the calendar..."lunch w/sweet yao".  Can't wait! 
 Non-Smoking Room please.  Preferably a suite with a wet bar, sunken tub, view over the pool, and complimentary room service.  Not to mention my own private valet. 
 Well, Mr. Elliott, I do believe I am quite shocked at your allegations of me being the troublemaker.  My review hasn't gone in yet and I guess I am going to have to mention...that you are the troublemaker! 
 Wonderful job! 
 Per Mark's conversation, you were going to get back to us on the scoop on France and utility counterparties.  Any update? 
 What do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the master in, but we have a bad certificate, and no trading should be done until we get a new certificate? 
 How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.   Your visit seemed all too short.  We probably won't see you for a few years, but I really enjoyed our dinners and chats.  Stay out of trouble and make us proud! 
 The meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements. 
 The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some time.  The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to the gents and is becoming quite the rage.  Fashion trends are quite slow in reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.  Has this trend crossed the Atlantic?!  Has Justin bought a pair in red?  We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch! 
 Taffy, can you work with Nicola to get this conf. call set up with London, in Suzanne's absence.  Thanks! 
 I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.  Obviously, everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.  She looked up Gary Bode, who Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager, but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.  She suggested for the Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good, or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very expensive!...just kidding!)  I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.  Perhaps we should set up a meeting to talk to Phillipe Bibi about the Fishkin project, so we make sure we get a good person assigned to us.   What do you think? 
 You forgot to have me off the week of Thanksgiving too.  I know I mentioned that to you... 
 No word? 
 I have noticed that humility is one of your most pronounced character traits!  Am glad you responded and look forward to seeing you... 
 At Mark's request, I am transmitting proposed changes to the collateral=20 arrangement language in the Online GTC's.  Please let me know if it meets= =20 with your approval.  8.  Collateral Arrangements.  Counterparty shall (at Enron=01,s request) fr= om=20 time to time and at Enron=01,s option either:  (i) within one Business Day = of=20 such request by Enron, provide to Enron a letter of credit in respect of=20 Counterparty's obligations under any Transaction, in such form and for such= =20 amount and from such issuer, as is acceptable to Enron in its absolute=20 discretion; or (ii) within such period as is specified by Enron, provide fo= r=20 the benefit of Enron a guaranty from a party, in such form and for such=20 amount as is acceptable to Enron in its absolute discretion.  Failure so to= =20 provide such letter of credit or guaranty or any default under such letter = of=20 credit or guaranty shall constitute a default hereunder giving rise to the= =20 immediate right of termination by Enron under this Transaction. 
 Per our conversation, the additional "to do" list is:  1.  plumber still needs to do his stuff 2.  put up new light fixture in back bedroom 3.  fix broken window in Peter & Nancy's front bedroom.  You'll need to call them to let them know the day you're doing it. 
 I'm out Tues. and Weds. at an in house seminar.  How does today or Thursday sound? 
 Thanks for taking a look! 
 When you get back, I got a call from Koch about the Morgan "assignment".  As you recall, we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with their commodity business.  Koch called me and they want to get a copy of the "assignment".  Since it wasn't an assignment, what should I provide them?  I don't know that I can provide them a copy of our Servicing Agreement.  What should I do? 
 Per David Forster, they should be doing the online trading simulation tomorrow. 
 Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades thereunder.  So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.  So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put:  "Need board resolution prior to trading" 
 To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists:  Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.  As noted below, an additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.  FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week. 
 I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.  Do you need me to make you a copy or are you also getting updates?  Also, I get faxes of all their notices.  So far nothing I've received has been interesting.  Do you get copies of their notices?  Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth noting?  They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and ask Mark for a raise to match my title! 
 I thought of you this weekend.  It was the fall antique festival in Round Top and I went, but it wasn't quite as nice as the pleasant day I had with you and your family.  That was such a perfect day all around and I will treasure it.  I hope all is going well.... 
 So I don't forget for Monday, Shari just send around the Canadian "eligible swap participant" language to be inserted in all Canadian confirms.  Don't we also need to add that to the Canadian online GTC's? 
 Yes, the list is the final approved counterparty list before the roll out of the system.  All counterparty lists are due by the close of business tomorrow.  If you are not sure of what the current approved counterparty lists are let me know. 
 That's ok.  Our trading policy doesn't allow you to trade anything we trade. 
 Do not worry about that new product type.  It doesn't pertain to you.  If you see none that looks like power you might want to pay attention.  I know Jeff has been getting similar emails. 
 The document wasn't in the blue file either.  I called Tanya and asked her if she could fax us up a copy of it.  Also, I asked her to let you know what her thoughts were on the proposed amendment.  Do you want me to call Rick at BMO and let him know you're working on it? 
 Just a confirmation, we have the following lawyers scheduled to attend the upcoming conference:   you, Justin, Paul and Jon.  Is that correct? 
 See Lotus Notes 
 Lovely note, crummy master.  It makes Belco look good!  I know Olin Corporation only because they had a plant near the summer camp I went to in North Carolina and there were days when the stench from the plant pervaded the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains where the camp was located.  That plant manufactured the plastic wrap that went around all those cigarettes they were making in North Carolina.  I kinda remember them being a plastics company back then. 
 Attached is the latest draft of the referenced GTC. 
 Font of useless knowledge! 
 Would you like to respond?! 
 Per Mark's earlier emails and conversations, we have 10 govt's/utilities with masters in place that are approved to trade, with about another 30 currently being negotiated.  The other 30 or so will only be approved to trade when we get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto (like legal opinions). 
 Just an FYI  About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the referenced counterparty.  She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.  I got a call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.  I called John and gave him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals before trading, etc.  I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get the trade, we're not surprised. 
 We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers still have not received notification of our name change.  This is causing problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.   When will you be able to get this notice our of our name change? 
 I have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change, but the NYMEX says the brokers have to file some form with the CFTC, and they can't file that form until they receive the notice from us. 
 How can you be on vacation this week if you are responding to this email? 
 We have tried to get the computer people to respond to your request for Lotus Notes access, but they don't respond.  Mark, what do you think the next step is? 
 Mark, open up felix the cat.  He is adorable! 
 As far as your email questions, my responses are following:  1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow. 2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me. 3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway. 4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with. 5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say "not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the financial net worth test. 6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note. 
 Attached are the revised online GTC's.  The weather GTC's won't change except for the credit support language, so I thought that you could make that same change when you made it to the rest of the GTC's. 
 Did we order that special UK sized paper?  I still have to copy that OMLX stuff for Mark Elliott's binder there in London. 
 Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.  His work was top notch, his subcontractors did a great job.  For instance, I put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house. I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.  Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his additional time or money on.  To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you pay. 
 Rod,  Nella sent me a Compliance Certificate and financial statements for the referenced counterparty.  I am forwarding them down to you. 
 I don't have anything specific to weather, I have material from recent general seminars I've worked on for Mark T. and Mark H. if you need it.  I do have general articles on weather...  I'm glad to see they have the "A Team" as a speaker.  You're marvelous! 
 The 1st list attached here is the one I used for the 1st list you have. 
 Per my voicemail, below are the revised online GTC's.  Sorry for an inconvenience this might have caused you. 
 I spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today.  He will only be in the office Mon. and Tues. of next week, so if possible, he would like to set up a demonstration with us together at your desk on the computer so he can work us through the software.  Let me know when a convenient time would be for you, maybe Tuesday sometime? 
 A reminder for when you get back on Monday! 
 I spoke to Mark Taylor.  How does Tuesday at 11:00 am sound? 
 11:00 am Central Standard Time (1 hour earlier than New York). 
 What's the scoop on the TXU negotiation?  Brant says we're in a strong negotiation position with them right now, because they've acquired Howard's book and need our consent, and also have to post an expensive LC with us to take in those Howard trades.  He wants to know if he should use our leverage here to get that ISDA Master in place. 
 Brent,  I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me know.  Thanks! 
 Just a note, if you've got some recent pictures of your daughter to bring them... 
 Attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's. 
 Anita sent me the message below re: board resolutions to trade out of Singapore.  Can Singapore trade out of the board resolution that was approved for ECT Interntional, or are we going to have to get another board resolution signed allowing financial trading out of the Singapore office? 
 Per our discussion... 
 I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you usually do? 
 Edmund,  Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.  I don't know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, ECTRIC can sign directly. Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, Managing Director or Chairman.   It looks like the London based officers who could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's signature.  Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for signature, as also will your London Credit person.  Congrat Anita!  This is very exciting! 
 No, I haven't met Matt, in fact, I don't know much about him.  Is he here now?  For how long?  Thru the Legal Conference?  I would be happy to help in whatever way I can.  As you know, we've recently revised our forms, so this would be a good time to get him indoctrinated.  I will, of course, be sad to have you leave us.  You have been wonderful to work with from both a personal and professional standpoin.  Your baby's gain in your time is a loss to Enron, because are a most valued asset to our company.  I hope our lives will cross again some time!  Best wishes for your future, you deserve the best! 
 Mark, should we forward Carol's email to Bill, so he knows what the issues are? 
 Regulatory made some changes to the power description and Awais wanted Legal's sign off again and needs a response by tomorrow.  Will that be a problem? 
 With respect to Online Trading, Mark wanted me to follow up with you re: insurance/reinsurance company issues.  Per our earlier conversations, I am saying "no" to online trading for all insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with.  The online people have come back and said, hey wait a minute, you are already trading with insurance companies without a master, i.e. Swiss Re.  They are wanting to open up Swiss Re for online trading and any other insurance/reins. we are currently trading with without a master in place.   Do you have a list of those companies?   What are your feelings about that?  Can we trade online with Swiss Re?  How about any other insurance companies you are currently trading with without a master in place?  Or do you want me continue to say no?  Thanks for your help! 
 The Icon worked and I've pulled it up and can use it.  Thanks for your help!  How's things going there?  Are you getting excited about going back home? Have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you?  Everything cool on the roommate front? 
 I looked at Gillian's website and she is adorable!  What a cutie!  I've bookmarked it and I'll keep looking for updates. 
 I'd like to attend! 
 Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the online trading issues.  We have to get similar letters out to some of the South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.  Much thanks!  By the way, weren't you out for vacation?  Did you have a good time? 
 Leslie Hansen was out today so Elizabeth forwarded your language to one of our power attorneys in the Portland office for review.  I have some minor clean up changes from Elizabeth, but except any material changes to come from Christian Yoder in our Portland office.  As soon as I receive Christian's comments I will add forward them on to you. 
 It just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with Mark for other countries, that I am approving online trading for Mexican counterparties we have a master in place with, however, in my later thinking, did our advice from Mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of online transactions? 
 I have forwarded on your email and fax to Marie Heard.  She was already working on that issue, what a happy coincedence! 
 When are you coming in?  When shall we have dinner? 
 Below are my responses to your email:  1.  Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation in the master only:   per our conversation. 2.  CMS Marketing Services & Trading:  Trading is limited to fixed price swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options.  This limitation is contained in the Company's Trading Policy, which they have provided to us.   We cannot trade anything except the types of products listed in the trading policy. 3.  Venezuela:  per Mark's conv. w/Dave Forster, we do not want to pursue the due diligence on this country at this time. 4.  Phibro, Inc.:    see note #1 5.  Swiss Re:  See my note 11 below. 6.  Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency transactions.  This should solve our problem so we should be able to open them for trading any commodity. 7.  Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above. 8.  UBS AG.  They recently sold their book and got out of the energy commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest rate transactions with them.  Their master is also trading limited, and we could not trade energy commodities with them without amending it or doing a fix similar to Tokyo Mitsubishi. 9.  Aspect Resources.  I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master. 10.  Brant-Allen:  Their Board of Directors limited the trading we did with them to only the one trade we did under the master.  We cannot do any other trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from their Board of Directors.  So they are still "no" for online derivatives trading. 11.  Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not address.  When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation & bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions.  All kinds of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type of counterparty.  We therefore have to continue to say "no" to online trading based on these special handling procedures. 12.  Cox and Perkins:  We could say "yes" to online derivatives trading, however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have a master in place with. 13.  Kinetic Resources.  Ditto comment 12 above. 14.  Midland Cogeneration.  Still under review as to regulated utility status. 15.  Praixair:  see comment #1 above. 16.  Tembec.  The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided to us .  I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed above.  Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password Application.  Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these special signatory requirements. 17.  EW Scripps.  Same comment as #1 above. 18.  Maritime Electric.  Is a Canadian utility.  No Trading.  Critical Changes to my list:  1.  Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in Mexico.  However, we can still not do financial trading without having a master in place. 2.  Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this resolved, we are switching them to a "no".  Per my meeting today with Credit:  I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility or an eligible swap participant.  I'll be working on those tomorrow and will get back to you.  My Review of Your List:  List #1  1.  BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from your list.  This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with. ECT has a master in place with them.  Trades would roll under the ECT Master.  The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to energy price swaps and options.  No weather.  Case of Credit override.5 2.  Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and trade with this counterparty.  Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to do with these situations when we have more than one master in place. 3.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping issues I am going to have to talk to London about.  First, here in the U.S. Morgan got out of the energy commodity business.  We, in fact, "bought their book".  We actually couldn't "buy their book" because of our low credit rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity business.  Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap (not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix.  Saying all that, I don't know what, if any, trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S.  I need to talk to London and find out.  So Morgan right now is a big open issue. 4.  Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty. Houston has a master with this counterparty.  Trades should be done under the master.  The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of the Credit override. 5.  Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2) Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place, approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master, would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place, approved for all trading.  List #2  1.  Cabot Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 2.  Callon Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 3.  EIL Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 4.  Fortune Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 5.  Plains Resources:  Missed "X" on all weather 6.  PXRE Corp:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only 7.  St. Mary Land & Exploration:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 8.  Stratum Group:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 9.  Tempest Reinsurance:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only 10.  Twister Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 11.  United Salt:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 12.  West Texas Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather  List #3  1.  Bargo Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 2.  Belco Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 3.  Cross Timbers:  Missed "X" on all weather 4.  Encore Acquisition:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 5.  Norfolk Southern:  You've got them restricted for everything, I've got them as "OK" for everything 6.  RMS Monte Christo:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 7.  Sapient Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather 
 In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks! 
 We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for advice? 
 Bob Shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different product groups' confirmation and GTC forms.  The two issues out of the meeting I was asked to bring to your attention were:  1.  Attaching the Online GTC's to the outgoing confirmations.  Per our discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all outgoing confirmations.  That does not seem to be the general consensus. There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going to do.  Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts. 2.  The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  First, after our discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a "B" approved GTC with credit.  Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to him.  I guess the physical people are OK with that.  I don't know what discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want to have this confirmed for him.  Also, along with the credit override of the master, there is supposed to be some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.  Who will be drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups? 
 Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the updates below.  Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday. 
 Shari, per the emails below, have you received or do you have any other advice we need to add? 
 Thanks for the smiles!  I am busy this weekend, but if you're in town, how about doing the nickel tour and Village Shopping the next weekend?  If not, maybe another time when you are available.  Let me know... 
 FYI, we are also going to send out a memo to Columbian counsel requesting advice on online trading and asking them for any other general update to their earlier advice. 
 Below is a confirm issue for handling.  Chris, in the future, please direct your confirmation requests to Susan Bailey, who is the current paralegal on the confirm rotation, or if the request is for an Annex B, to each of Susan Bailey, Susan Flynn and Marie Heard.  Thanks! 
 Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do? 
 Shari said our new counsel was supposedly better counsel and that's why we asked for the update from them. 
 Pat, remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power deal with Duke.  You might want to get in touch with Federico.  Mark, FYI, also, I don't know if there are any problems with power out of Argentina. 
 Liz and Christian Yoder reviewed the description since you were out. 
 Last week I left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that Bob Bowen needed you to sign off on.  He says he never hear back.  Can you call him and give him the sign off.  Thanks! 
 Can you do me a favor and look to see if we are doing any financial trading with the following counterparties:  Florida Power & Light Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company Dakota Gasification Company Hydro-Quebec Enmax Corp.  Much thanks!
