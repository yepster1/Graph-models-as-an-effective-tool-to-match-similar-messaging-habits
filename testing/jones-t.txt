ject, but the overall "system" still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the database to all interested ENA employees.  I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of. First is our" jurisdictional database", which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon.  Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.  The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem.  The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system.  Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this. 
 It's a date!  Would you like me to make reservations at someplace nice, or just go casual? 
 FYI,  Today is the date for renewal of the Consent of Service of Process in connection with the ISDA Master Agreement in place with the referenced counterparty.  I have faxed Mr. Blaquier a request to provide me with evidence of such renewal.  I will keep you apprised. 
 My fax won't go through, I appear to have a bad number.  Can one of you provide me with a new fax & phone numbe ror contact Mr. Blaquier.  Thanks! 
 Debra is the paralegal for the physical gas trading group. 
 The fax still can't seem to go through.  Do I have too mane 2's in the fax #?  Do I need to add a 1 to dial out of the U.S.? 
 What's the scoop, can't come up with ten Top 10's?!!  I never thought I'd see the day... 
 You've received the whole thing.  Mark T. likes to ad lib a lot when he gives a presentation. 
 This came up at our Group meeting today, did you ever sign that Master Netting Agreement for Petro-Canada at year end? 
 new person taking over for Bob Shults 
 Attached please find referenced lists.  Again, now European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 Bob Klein from Salomon Smith Barney would like to arrange a conf. call tomorrow at 11:00 am.  I checked your calendar and you look clear so I told him that was OK and that we would call him. 
 I have been faxed a proposed form of assignment from El Paso with respect to certain trades transacted between 1/14 and 1/25 which they would like assigned to their affiliate, El Paso Energy Marketing Canada Inc.  I am having a messenger walk a copy down to each of you and need your direction as to whether we should consent to this assignment. 
 I have had to revise the list I provided to you earlier.  The change was shutting Kimball down for financial as well. 
 Shari, how do you want to handle this? 
 I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and hasn't heard from them.  I asked him to refax the renewal notice to them.  He said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got some time to resolve this.  I'll keep you posted. 
 Thanks for your email.  I don't want to state the obvious because you appear to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from trading in anything the company trades in.  Any trading you do for your own account must comply with this policy. 
 I do not appear to be having a winning record for getting my approval list right the first time today.  Attached is also a revised list for 01/31/00. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa... 
 Can you make a note in Lotus Notes reflecting your conversation.  Thanks! 
 FYI, about the Canadian master netting agreements. 
 Attached please find referenced list.  Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice.  On Sithe Power where we only changed the counterparty id #, there is no change from my previous approval. 
 I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty.  It's not surprising, it's a confusing master!  This is currently the only agreement we have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial transactions in one agreement.  There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (Global Contract Reference No. 96000160).  This agreement provides for financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.  It does not provide for any other physical products.  Call me if you have any questions... 
 Just a reminder to talk to me Monday about the utilities.  I was not aware we were not currently trading financial power, which they are getting ready to open up.  I figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot trade.  So, I've go to start opening up my utilities... 
 Marie was just telling me about your rough tour of duty in the French Alps next week.  I speak a little high school French...perhaps you might need some assistance while you are there...?! 
 How do they override letters go out?  Do you tell someone, do I need to? 
 Can you please shut this counterparty down for weather.  Thanks! 
 Fyi.  However, we need 7 file drawer files.  What do you think. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  On the amended counterparties, Southwestern Public Service Company is the only one with a change, with Enron sells power only, and on the only new counterparty, Minnesota Power, we've got Enron selling power only also.  Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further notice. 
 I thought Bob's email was cute.  I asked him to get me our deals numbers for the El Paso assignment, and he sent me the following... 
 Marie and I had a giggle over your email! 
 Who's Dana? 
 Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web sites:  www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records)  www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety, repair records)  www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test results" they have some info on SUV crash tests.  Since y'all don't have as many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident).  Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety... 
 You narratives aren't too long, I'm just giving you some grief! 
 I have created a database for the Legal Dept., somewhat similar to how the master swap agreement database works, for us to keep track of our approvals for EOL trading, as well as any executed amendments to the EOL Password Application, ETA, GTC, or any other EOL documents.  I have been inputting the data for the Houston based Credit counterparties, and was wondering whether you want me to input the London based Credit counterparties or not.  I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it for you.  Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you have an assistant do that.  Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very helpful).  It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty). Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at it just to see what I'm doing.  We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not fully operational yet.  Anyway, give me your thoughts...Don't make any changes, it'll screw things up... 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  As usual, no European power for U.S. counterparties until further ntocie. 
 Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated....! 
 As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your attention.  One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms. The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.  We need to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms evolve without  approval.  Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation change, if you make it in every agreement.  Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical component of the Fishkin Project).  Thanks for your attention to this. 
 Would you like to set up a time to chat?  My calendar is pretty clear this week, except for tomorrow at 2:00 pm. 
 We wish you the best for your vacation!  I hope the rest of the Credit Group maintains the high standard of diligence and promptness that you have established. 
 I haven't heard back from you about my EOL database.  I will hope that your lack of response means that you are busy, not in disapproval of my lovely database... 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  We have no changes to the amended counterparties, so the only counterparty really with a comment is Westcoast Energy, which we have not approved for power.  Of course, no European power for US entities until further notice. 
 My Apartment:  1.  Fix leg on sunroom denim couch 2.  Fix front of dresser drawer in back bedroom that is falling off 3.  Front door - handle is loose 4.  The window in the back bedroom behind the bed is missing trim.  I think the trim is in the closet in the living room.  The blinds won't be right if we don't get that trim in.  Downstairs Apartment:  1.  Fix broken window in front bedroom 2.  In bathroom, piece of wood has fallen off cabinet 3.  In bathroom, towel rack is broken.  Can you replace? 4.  Peter says ice cube maker won't shut water off when is on, so he just had it off 5.  Nancy said front door handle is loose 6.  Do we have any drips in sinks?  The floor refinishers will show up Monday morning.  They are going to refinish downstairs floors and my back stairwell.  I would like to recarpet upstairs.  Where do you suggest I go to get new carpeting? 
 Two emails and still no response...was it something I said?! 
 Can you change it on my calendar.  Thanks! 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  Since all the counterparties are amended counterparties, my changes are as follows:  1.  Statoil - no change in earlier approvals  2.  Texla -  I don't think it's a change, but they cannot trade US power, also there is no change for financial, I previously said and we continue not to trade financial.  3.  Avista Corporation- Washington Water Power Division.  For financial trading for Avista Corporation I previously said no financial trading.  I am going to open them up for all financial trading.  They can trade under the Avista Corporation name, or they can trade as Avista Corporation, acting through its Washington Water Power Division.   For power trading,  they can trade all US West power products, but can Enron can only sell to Avista for US East power products.  Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice. 
 Just a reminder to talk to Tim Belden... 
 You are the woman! 
 I have not heard back from DAPSA with respect to the Consent to Service of Process.  Can your business contact there give them a call?  Thanks. 
 Per my conversations with John Suttle in Credit, I am opening up the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products. 
 Just a reminder...to talk to Tim Belden.... 
 Why do we have two active masters?!  Because it appears that Synder/Santa Fe merged and Susan B. did not handle to multiple master issue! 
 In looking through Lotus Notes for EOL, it appears we have two active masters for Santa Fe Snyder Corporation.  Does anyone know which one is the active master? 
 The master agreement for this counterparty appears to not cover the Trade Option Exemption.  Are we adding that into confirms? 
 When would you like to discuss utilities...? 
 I went through our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and determined that the following masters do not permit power:  The Bakersfield Californian    newprint only Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG   no commodity transactions CGAS, Inc.      natural gas only (are currently shut down for trading because authority certificate only covered one trade) Coastal Gas Marketing Company   natural gas transactions only Credit Lyonnais New York Branch (AAA Program) no commodity transactions E.W. Scripps Company (The)    48.8 gram newsprint swaps only Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc.   no commodity transactions.  Weather is ok Mellon Bank NA     FX and currency option transactions only Midland Bank plc     FX and currency option transactions only National Westminster Bank    FX and currency option transactions only Palladium Insurance Limited    weather only Phibro, Inc.      energy price swaps based on fixed and floating prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products and/or call        and put options based on the prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products  Praxair, Inc.      natural gas only PXRE Corporation     weather only St. Paul Re (Bermuda) Ltd.    weather only Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited  weather only Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale  FX and currency option transactions only 
 TAKE A VACATION DAY! 
 Please find attached the referenced list.  For Enserco Energy, Inc., my previous approvals remain the same except for power, which has been shut down for trading (I can't just copy the last excel spreadsheet since the columns are not in the same order anymore).  Then, the only other new counterparty is also shut down for power but open for everything else. 
 We need to amend the master on Williams, and Mark asked me to see you about it because this type of amendment might have to be made to a number of counterparty masters.  When you have some time, can I come around...Thanks... 
 I will attend. 
 I have received executed copies of the following assignments of certain EOL trades (physical and financial):  1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Houston Pipe Line Company  2.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignee") and Enron North America Corp.  3.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and among Aquila Canada Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Enron North America Corp.  Copies of these assignments will be sent to the usual distribution group. 
 The EOL trade assignment letters are prepared off the same form we do our regular assignments.  There is no special language in the assignment form about online issues. 
 Attached are the Swap Group's form of Enron Corp. and Counterparty guarantees.  Erica, these forms are located at atty.fms/swaps/current forms/guaranty.doc. 
 I'm ready for a real challenge...!  It is always my pleasure to help you and Babs! 
 What the latest with Force?  Should we proceed with this amendment... 
 I have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of May 25, 1999.  This amendment deletes the prior Confidentiality provision in the ISDA Master Agreement and replaces it with our current Confidentiality language.  This change will allow either party to provide copies of the agreement to its Affiliates.  Copies will be distributed. 
 With this attitude, you are sure to work up in the standings of being our favorite Credit person... 
 The referenced counterparty is approved to trade all products except power. 
 I do believe you can look up who is working on this master in Lotus Notes... 
 Greg, check with Nella or Peter.  The ISDA 1994 Credit Support Annex should be contained in the binder I gave Peter during his secondment here in Houston. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 15, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be distributed in the usual manner. 
 And you just know I just hate to be right...! 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note the following:  1.  For Puget Sound, no change in our earlier approvals except for power. For power, open for West products, but ENRON SALES only for East products.  2.  For Ferrell International Limited, Credit shows them as an amended CP, but I have no record of seeing them before, so I treated them as a new CP.  Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 8, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty. Copies will be distributed in the usual manner 
 I spoke to Mark Taylor today and he said that he spoke this week with a lawyer from, I believe Skadden, that had been hired by the OMLX to talk to ED&F Mann about the CFTC issue.  I think Mark Taylor is waiting to hear back from the Skadden lawyer. 
 We have received the executed  Letter Agreement dated January 25, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with respect to the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be distributed in the usual manner. 
 We have received fully executed copies of the following assignments of physical natural gas transactions:  1.  Assignment of Various Natural Gas Transactions by and between El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and Enron North America Corp.  2.  Assignment of Various Natural Gas Transactions by and between El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and Enron Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Thanks for following up with this!  It is critical we have accurate information on our positions.  Continually busting our limits could subject the company to potentially substantial fines from the NYMEX.  Please let me know what Mike's thoughts are... 
 Oh, you little sweet talker...! 
 No, I didn't get it.  Just reply back to this email & reattach it. 
 Can we do a "See" dropdown like the Master Swap Agreement Database, so we can track name changes?  Thanks! 
 As a follow-up to our conversation, the referenced counterparty is not an eligible swap participant, therefore we need to shut them down for all financial. 
 What do you think about the situation below? 
 The Legal/Credit Meeting scheduled for today is canceled due to the absence of Susan Flynn. 
 Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  On Encal, the only amended counterparty, I don't know if this is a change or not from the prior approval, but Leslie shut them down for power.  All other prior approvals for that counterparty should remain the same. 
 Let me know what you think...I may go do my "long" run on Sunday, if you're doing one too, maybe we can meet for breakfast... 
 What are your thoughts on this... 
 Is this trade something you know something about? 
 I spoke to Mike Mulligan at Paribas and he said he had discussed this trade with Lee.  I don't know if you need any help from me expediting this amendment to the guaranty, let me know if you do.  Mike's number is in our Master Swap Agreement database. 
 Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments:  1.  BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me.  We got the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all financial. 2.  Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America.  That should be the name that goes out on the confirm.  All the counterparties on today's list are shut down for power. 
 Attached is the Enron Employee Referral Form and resume of my friend Patty Young, which I will be submitting to two groups for consideration.  Please let me know if anything else is needed. 
 I don't understand what it is I haven't completed.  Can you let me know so I can complete the form.  Thanks! 
 I'll pass on any other articles on the transportation industry that might be in our various derivatives magazines .  Glad you liked this one! 
 What if there is no specific job.  I spoke to Mary Solmonson in Global Contracts and she said they had several job offerings and to send the resume to her and she would take a look at it and forward it to the relevant groups? 
 EOL needs to hear ASAP whether Nicor Gas Company is approved to trade online...can you let me know...thanks! 
 Attached is the referenced approval list. 
 Attached is the revised Referral Form and Resume for Patty Young.  I hope this does it! 
 Tonight I'm going to see a house after work today and then I have a late Sergei workout.  But keep me in mind in the future...  I finally got your application accepted by our personnel group, so now I can forward it to the respective groups for review.  One of the bad things about big corporations are the forms you have to fill out to do anything... 
 That was funny! 
 We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement (which supersedes and replaces the Master Agreement [ECT] executed 1/30/97, dated as of 10/19/95):  Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:  10/19/95  Executed Date:  02/09/00  Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:  TXU Energy Trading Company  Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX  Confirm Desk:    As previously noted, we have agreed to a special form of confirmation acceptance letter 
 FYI, attached is the Confirm Desk's latest list of confirms requiring special provisions. 
 At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, since it's not such a large amount of money.  Sara Shackleton is heading down there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to give you a head's up about our thinking on this. 
 Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.  We had a nice lunch at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my house for a chat.  Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient. Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life.  I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night and we're all a bit excited about that.  Then Thursday night is our big night out at a blues club.  This email was a good idea.  Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting with her more than every two years!  I'll be in touch when I get back.   All my love, 
 We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) executed 04/08/99, effective as of 06/09/98.  Copies will be distributed.  We also received the originally executed Confirmation, Deal # EM3927.1,2 & 3.  I will sent it down to the Confirmation Desk. 
 Dear Mr. Zunic,  Pursuant to the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am attaching a sample form of our Master Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529 if you have any comments or questions. 
 With respect to the referenced lists, all the counterparties on these lists are amended counterparties and there are no changes to our earlier approvals.  FYI, Credit did not have Ionic Energy down as an amended counterparty, but per my conversation with Tom Moran, it was on the initial second list, and should be treated as an amended counterparty. 
 Below is the new drop down I need added:  Trade Option Representation (choose one only):  standard weather included enron must be offeree none other  Mike, the above should have a box to check, and the box should always check "standard" unless someone goes in and effectively changes it.  Then add the following:  Other trading provisions  pulp & paper FRABBA  Switching databases to the EnronOnline database:  We need to add a category for a new product, Credit Derivatives, have a comment box just like financial or power, have it follow after power. 
 This will confirm our conversation today regarding which European jurisdictions are approved for trading credit derivatives:  the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Finland and Switzerland.  The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.  Per our conversation, Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.  Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  I haven't said it for a few lists, but remember, no European power for US counterparties until further notice... 
 Greg,  It appears we send Dynegy Canada a draft ISDA in July of 1999, and got no response from them.  We will need to update the ISDA we sent them in July since our form has changed since then.  Once we get the go ahead from John Suttle in Credit as to whether we need to update the credit, we will prepare the ISDA Master Agreement you have requested. 
 My pleasure...! 
 There are no changes from my previous approvals for the two counterparties on this list. 
 No, they never gave me an updated copy. 
 It appears this class is on a Sunday & a Monday.  Did I get this right? 
 Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States Power Companies.  We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).  The counterparty that showed up on yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation (cpy ID #161).  The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota corporation.  I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals... 
 Robin Newman Matthew Bender & Co. 212/448-2168 
 With the execution of the Wisconsin Gas Company master, this brings the total executed financial masters to 400.  The countdown to 500 executed financial masters is now starting!  Congratulations to the Legal and Credit teams for getting us to this point and for a job well done! 
 Leslie,  Why am I getting this information below?  These counterparties are not on my approval lists for the last few days.  Did Frank ask you questions re: the counterparties below, and you just want me to put this info in the EOL Legal Database? 
 With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with, do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" equivalant rules? 
 Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think Mark was going to talk to you about it.  Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.  He feels he is having to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.  Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.  His phone # is 713/331-5049.  FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:  Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.  Even though Peoples Gas is a division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing license was not granted in that name.  Further, I earlier shut down Tampa Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas. 
 I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.  As we discussed, Dynegy Canada is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done with ECC.  Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA. Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in place with either ECC or ENA.  Works for me...! 
 Brenda Whitehead prepared that presentation and should be sending it to you. 
 I would be more than happy to update the database with any comments you may want me to add, don't ever feel bad, when I don't expect something I just need to know what it's about.  I hope we can open the EOL Legal Database soon so you can update any comments or notes directly into it. 
 In response to your email:  1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade online.  2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.  3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process should continue to be done through the Legal Department.

 Per the request of Mark Taylor, I am forwarding the attached. 
 Attached is the list of the counterparties that EOL wants to approve for emissions auction trading.  Please let me know ASAP if there are any counterparties on this list that should not be allowed to trade emissions auctions. 
 Per the note below from Brent, I am going to inactivate this master.  Also, per his note, it appears you should make a note to review the credit prior to approving any future trades. 
 Gracie,  My confirmation of the class showed the 8/8 and 8/9.  You may want to go in and check your schedule. 
 I had Calpine Power Services Company shut down for financial, and we got the master in signed, so I am going to open them up.  Can you add them to tomorrow's list.  Thanks! 
 I don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit derivatives, but attached is the list EOL sent me.  Many of the counterparties on the list are London based credit counterparties, and I will not be reviewing those, but I thought you might want to take a look at this to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at.  When I'm done (probably some time at end of the day since I just got the list yesterday and it's due today!), I will be emailing my approvals to Mark Dilworth in London. 
 Just a reminder to send me a memo asking me to delete Bob Shultz as and EOL signatory and add Sheri Thomas in his place.  Much thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated to reflect this change.  European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..  The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.  Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.  Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. 
 To confirm our conversation, can you add "Credit Derivatives" as a new products to my database.  We will need the same drop downs as the other produsts (gas trading, financial trading, etc.).  Thanks! 
 I am aware that you need a list from me, I am working on it right now.  I just got the list from EOL yesterday and I'm reviewing it as fast as I can. My goal is to get it done by the end of my workday, so you should have it when you arrive in the morning. 
 There should be no question of duplication of ISDA Master Agreement or any other master swap agreements between Houston and London, because Houston's contracting party is usually Enron North America Corp. and London's contracting party is usually Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  We cannot do business under each others' financial master agreements for legal and tax reasons.  ENA and Enron Canada Corp. can do business under each other's masters because the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went away.  Further, Houston and Canada subsequently entered into a Services Agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each other's behalf (necessary for tax and legal reasons). 
 Below is the list of the final work we need you to bid on for the downstairs apartment:  1.  Paint inside of bathroom cabinets 2.  Paint outside and inside of kitchen cabinets 3.  Fix bottom of drawer of kitchen cabinet located right of dishwasher 4.  Replace closet rod in front bedroom to match other closet's rod 5.  Hammer down shelf ends that are loose in closet in back bedroom 6.  Clean ends of door hardware that have drips on them. 7.  Rehang blinds (we'll have to buy new hardware for existing blinds and then I will have to buy new blinds if any were bent by the kids)  Did I catch everything?

 We have some files in an empty cubicle that kinda look like global contract files.  They have global contract sheets and numbers attached to the front of the documents in the files.  If they belong to anyone in your group they need to be claimed now, because we are doing a cubicle restructuring this weekend and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of.  Can you have someone come 
 Mark says I need to talk to you about the Credit Derivatives confirmation process... 
 Please add TXU Energy Trading Company to list.  We had an old style "ERMS" master in place, so they weren't allowed to do power, but now we have an ISDA in place (even tho' Brant Reves threw out the new guaranty, but that is another story!), so I am going to open them up for weather. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I am responsible for those counterparties originating from Houston Credit.  Edmund Cooper is responsible for the UK Credit based counterparties.  I am still resolving issues on about 8-10 counterparties.  If something doesn't make sense, let me know. 
 Can you let me know what the scoop is on those countries and I will update my memo.  Thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following countries to the non-approved list:  Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.  Below is the list, now updated to reflect this change.  Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..  Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches). This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.  Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. 
 You are the best! 
 Why does it always have to be my deals...?!!! 
 We've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX  Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.  The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.  It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend.  Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation... 
 We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add the rep into every confirm.  BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, and this has caused much difficulties.  I am going to count it as signed, since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.  Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me.  Much thanks. 
 We have received the executed  Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000.  This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Updating another blue file because Susan B., this time, has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes! 
 It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.  I didn't either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.  When you have a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel. 
 I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.  I communicated that to Bob Bowen.  He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business.  Wow! 
 Carol, will you handle this or Mark? 
 We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999.  This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities Act representation to the master.  Copies will be distributed.  Confirmation Desk:  you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now. 
 Here's the list with the missing counterparties. 
 Yeah! 
 Probably... 
 I just got a call from Dave and Frank and they tell me I have a whole week this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade Australian financial power.  I'll need to talk to you about his Monday. 
 Hey guys, take Monday off! 
 ISDA has published the referenced supplement.  Among other changes, the supplement adds hundreds of new gas, liquids and power price sources.  Copies will be distributed to you. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Some comments:  We got a master financial agreement in place with Calpine Power Services  Company so it has been opened up to trade all financial.  Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master" with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial products as well.  For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under what  names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email about this about a month to two months ago).  That letter had the counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its  Trammo Gas Division".  I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that name.   Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions... 
 David,  I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.  I am the lead contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group (financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and Credit teams.  I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).   Have your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?  Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) with respect to a trade?  Thanks for your help! 
 I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we always seem to need more time. 
 Sheri,  I need the trade date so I know what to date the termination. 
 I sent the documents to Paul Davis on March 6. 
 Actually, bluebonnets bloom for a short time, maybe three week early in the Houston Spring, in March, after heavy Spring rains have gone on for a bit, and when the temperature is in the 60's to 70's.  They would get fried and fade in the heat of a Houston summer.  However, I don't know the temperatures and rain condition of your summers, and what time of your year would replicate those conditions. 
 Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland, "Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc." is a bad name.  The correct legal name for this counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement database:  "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division".  I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters (713/544-5938, ext. 5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password Application with the name corrected.  Please show this correction in your records as well. 
 Please take me off your distribution.  I already bought my new car.  Thank youl. 
 I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and provisions.  Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that? 
 Did you forget something in your email? 
 Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.  1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian financial power.  2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading? Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not approve the London based counterparties.  3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.  FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by London when they arrive for work Friday morning. 
 As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty list.  Thinking through this product today and reading through my various emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved financial power product.  I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?  The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have been issued passwords). 
 Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the messenger)...  With respect to your form of online GTC:  It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty (a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with Enron Australia.  In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online "Deemed ISDA" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation).  As you can see when you look at our "Deemed ISDA" form of confirmation, there are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation includes, such as authority and tax representations, "arm's length transaction" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting "in respect of the same transaction"), no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, definition of "Transaction" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, "Website" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we usually say "Loss" instead of "Market Quotation", also,  Market Quotation and Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we need the word "integrated" with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a "single agreement" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our "severability" and "setoff" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, business day defined as Sydney only, etc.  Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in place.  I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.  After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help resolving all these issues... 
 Debbie,  Thanks for the heads up on this.  I've been trying to get David Minns for several days about various issues.  Keep me posted. 
 I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara. Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing contractual documents without Legal's initials.  There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us: (1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.  Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more after lunch.  On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.  Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on too.  Are you also working on this?  So that's what's going on... 
 Per an earlier conveersation with Dave, ee weren't quite sure if you have seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online, so I am sending you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the products we offer, as well as the Enron entity that a counterparty would enter into the trade with. 
 Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.  David Minns will have to get back to us about all the other products!  For the current U.S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for "US Power Financial Swaps".  I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine. 
 Thanks for returning my message.  I had an Australian issue come up and anyone who was familiar with Australian law was unreachable and I was in an absolute panic.  But as things usually do, this problem worked itself out too!  As usual, I am always humbly in your debt... 
 I have developed a database in which I keep track of the counterparties Legal has approved, any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty (I 'm giving away my secret that I just don't approve them on on pure whim!) and the products such counterparties are approved to trade.  Additionally, at the bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.  The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel spreadsheets.  If I have missed a counterparty let me know).  The information for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about 6-7 weeks ago.  I am going to have to go back and input the power data from the original approval lists.  As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been entered for those products. You should count them as being approved for everything.  Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will delete them.  I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look and I will be glad to hear any input.  Obviously, we are all working out the kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along, so this database may evolve over time.  The only people who should have change access are the Legal team (Mike Neves:  Mark Taylor, Carol St Clair, Leslie Hansen, Marie Heard and myself). Let me know if you have change access by mistake.  On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database confidential to the group we have granted view access to. Do not forward this email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval.  Much thanks! 
 I would like to take responsibility for the technical side of this, but in all honesty I must admit I'm just the idea guy...(I'm know I'm breaking all your illusions about me today, I'll have no more secrets!) 
 1.  Per my discussion last week with David Minns, I sent him a spreadsheet so he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products EnronOnline offers so he could determine whether an Australian based counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the EnronOnline products.  It was my understanding that he had not seen a comprehensive list off all the products we offer.  2.  However, on a going forward basis, David Minns or someone in Legal will need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new Australian based counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a Credit and a Legal signoff for trading every products we offer, whether physical, financial, power, gas, liquids, weather, p&p, US, European or other country based product, etc..  Houston Legal does it every day for every new Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every new London Credit based counterparty and Australian Legal will need to do the same.  If some other system will be in place in Australia, David Minns will need to discuss that with Mark Taylor and David Forster. 
 Please find attached referenced lists.  It is not clear to me yet how we are going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.  I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties... 
 Now might be your time to plant!  I'm already miserable with the Houston summer heat.  It's already in the high 90's with high 90 humidity.  After 4-5 more months of this it's going to get pretty old!  How's little Sophie.  Any new cute things she's doing you need to tell me about? 
 Mark,  I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you... 
 Lou,  I left Mark Tawney a voicemail to call me re: the ISDA sample form.  I'll need to know a little bit more about the company so I send them the right form. 
 The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who still needs to complete his training).  Please let me know if you cannot log in.  I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their perspective why you should not be able to log in. 
 I have tried to call him directly but he was not available. 
 Yes, I left him a voicemail telling him I needed to know a little more about the counterparty so I could make sure i send them the right form (are they US or non-US counterparty, insurance company, energy company, etc).  Also, the name and address of his contact and I will send it directly if he would prefer that. 
 We have received an executed amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated March 20, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I will be out Friday afternoon and Monday afternoon for my termite and house inspections for my new house. 
 Per my voicemail, the attached confirm is still a moving target with the tax lawyers, I'll be in touch once we resolve the tax language. 
 I have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial confirmation process and ISDA Master Agreements.  I have also seen information on your company in the January 1999 issue of Risk Magazine.  I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the Legal Dept. and am looking at software systems that can help us manage our documentation needs.  If you are unfamiliar with our company,  Enron is the largest integrated marketer of energy in the United States.  We have a Web Page located at www.enron.com.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. is the marketing affiliate of our parent, Enron Corp.  I would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide, and after I have a chance to look at the information, would like to talk to you or a representative from you company in some depth.  I am located in Houston, Texas and my phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Thank your for your attention herewith. 
 We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in April.  If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to address them in our training.  Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll check them against our schedule.  Would your group organize this lunch or ours?  How many people are we talking about.  Only Global Contract or Global Counterparty too?  Let me know the details so we can start planning... 
 Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going forward basis.  To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power. This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us evidence of their FERC licensing. 
 On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but we are not there yet.  On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am opening them up for all financial and power. 
 I spoke to Harry Collins, one of our emissions lawyers, and he said there should be no problem trading emissions with a governmental entity on the emissions auction website, as long as they can trade emissions generally.  If you have any specific questions, call Harry Collins at x39692. 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  NOTE:   This master appears to have been signed in 1996 and didn't make its way down to Houston until now.  Type of Contract: Master Agreement (ECT Canada Form)  Effective Date:  06/16/95  Executed Date:  06/24/96  Enron Entity:  Enron Capital and Trade Resources Canada Corp., now known as Enron Canada Corp.  Counterparty:  Originally, NOVAGAS CLEARINGHOUSE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, now through name changes and merger, DYNEGY CANADA INC.  Transactions Covered: Energy price swaps or option transactions only (no pulp & paper, weather, interest rate & currency or FX)  GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  We need to get this master inputted immediately into the EnronOnline System so all of the confirmations for ENA and ECC will immediately roll up under this master.  CONFIRM DESK:  Please immediately start rolling up all the ENA and ECC trades under this master, whether online, offline, or brokered trades. 
 Novagas has a long and tortured history...when you've got a few hours and want to be incredibly bored I'll share it with you.  Let's just say that Canada has been the only one aware of this signed master.  You can quote my somewhat eloquent words "if it ain't in Legal it ain't!" 
 You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in with the rest of Legal's.  Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.  Once we are in agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.  The theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian counterparties.  Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m. the next day (which will be your morning) from the transmittal of the list. 
 In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.  Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week. Much thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Kathy Bolan at PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation (and my confirmation thereof with Messrs. Suttle and Bowen), all cross-border trades between PG&E Canada and ENA should go under the master between PG&E Canada and ECC. 
 Thank you for your help.  I look forward to hearing from your U.S. person. 
 We have received the fully executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 1, 1999 between ECC and the referenced counterparty. This First Amendment adds the British Columbia Securities representation to the ISDA Master Agreement.  Confirm Desk:  You no longer have to add this representation to every confirmation. 
 I have not started responding for Australia yet. 
 Can you add Paul Radous in Credit with full edit capability to this database.  Much thanks! 
 Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.  I have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and physical power (through EPMI).  Can you please let me know first, if you have a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties and date of the contract.  Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a RUSH. 
 As usual, you are the best! 
 Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.  We just got a master in signed with them and they cannot trade weather, pulp & paper & fx. Much thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Kathy Moore this morning, please open the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products. 
 Ughh... 
 Mark said you would know who it is in London that prepared a "script" for your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal.  Liz Sager is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and needs to prepare a similar script for them.  If you could let me know who to contact I'd appreciate it.  Thanks for your help! 
 Thanks for your help in getting this done.  You're a star! 
 Mr. Holtz,  At the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am enclosing a sample copy of the referenced Master Agreement.  This agreement is subject to Legal and Credit review of the counterparty.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529.  We look forward to hearing from you.     Tana Jones Sr. Legal Specialist 
 Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.  We got a signed master agreement in place with them and I need to change the approvals. Thanks. 
 Can you please add the new credit person below for full edit priviliges to the Financial Trading Agreement  database.  Much thanks! 
 Did you notice on the spreadsheet for 3/27 they opened a new power product, US East Power Phys Firm ICAP? 
 Do you have any idea what David is trying to get at! 
 I am flying, are you?  If you are on my flight I would be happy to have you drive to the airport with me.  If you need to know my reservations, I can email them to you. 
 Is everything OK? 
 You be the man!  Can you email or fax the trader guidelines Scott is talking about.  Much thanks! 
 I'm glad to hear that everything is good.  I'm so excited for you, you'll be a wonderful mother!   XXOO 
 Attached is the proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement with Platt's. 
 Some notes on the attached lists:  3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my earlier approvals.  3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do pulp & paper and weather under it. Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status. In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine what if anything they can do.  3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week. 
 On this Statoil Trade, I guess this is a physical trade done with ENA.  Can you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so I can attach them to my assignment.  I am forever in your debt... 
 Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".  Not to get you worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!  After all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.  (Not to belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".)  We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after viewing, we don't want the other lads to get jealous!) 
 Attached is a proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced party. 
 Obviously Frank, you are trying to kill me...! 
 What ever happened to that CGAS certificate we were trying to get in connection with my swap agreement?  Last note I had was that resolution we were trying to get requires approval of Board for each trade and you were going to talk to Mark about how to resolve this.  Was it resolved? 
 David has sent us a memo re: Procedures for Approval to trade in Australia that I think you will find helpful. 
 I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap participant.  For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.  So this ball is in Credit's court. 
 Per your request... 
 Sounds good to me!  Saturday, 8:00 am at Buffalo Grille it is! 
 Attached is the referenced Confidentiality Agreement.  I hope to have the Fieldston one to you shortly. 
 Attached please find the referenced agreement. 
 Per the request of Sara, attached is the form of US online GTC (w/collateral). 
 We have received notice that the referenced counterparty is updating its phone system and is changing all of its phone numbers.  I am sending a copy of the notice to the usual distribution. 
 The list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for documentation, which includes Connie Sutton from Global Contracts.  As to what numbers they are replacing, they are replacing all the phone numbers we might have had across the board with this counterparty.  If you would like to see the numbers, obtain a copy of the notice from Connie Sutton.  As I just mailed it, it should get there in a few days. 
 Per my voicemail, attached is my list of agreements. 
 Your big opportunity appears to be here!  Some guy in the for sale database under misc messages is looking to put together a team for the year 2000. This is your big break... 
 Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade credit derivatives.  Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" , "amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives. Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.  I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't. 
 There is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on the 3/30/00 list, so I am not sending that list.  On the list for 3/31/00, first, David Minns is in the Houston office today, so I gave the response today for the one Australian counterparty on this list.  We are meeting with Mark on Wednesday to try and figure out the approval process for Australia, so maybe after Wednesday I'll start responding for them.  Second, on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have been indicated as credit derivative counterparties, so none of the counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives (even though I haven't "X'ed" them out). 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated April 3, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Attached are the Confidentiality Agreements for the referenced counterparties. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  Remember, no credit derivatives are approved for any counterparites unless Credit has indicated they are a credit derivative counterparty on the list. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated April 4, 2000 with the referenced counterparty amending the Electronic Trading Agreement .  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received the executed copy of the amendment dated April 5, 2000 to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received fully executed copies of the following Confidentiality Agreements:  Energy Argus, Inc. dated April 5, 2000  AccuWeather, Inc. dated April 4, 2000  Copies have been faxed to the counterparties.  I will also send copies to Dave Samuels for your files. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Again, my note about credit derivatives not being marked, and also, I am still not responding for Australia yet on a going forward basis. 
 Are we trading with the referenced counterparty? 
 Russell,  In the future please put me on all notices about counterparty trading.  I am responsible for the Legal Department's approval of online counterparties across all product areas and need to know any limitations that might affect a counterparties' ability to trade.  Thanks! 
 Troy Black called me about that C.A. I passed on to you.  He said he needed it to go out today and also passed on words from the counterparty to the effect that the C.A. was "non-negotiable and that if we had any comments they need to be minor, or forget about it..."  There you have it! 
 We have executed a Letter Agreement dated April 10, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 She seemed very nice, like she would make a good employee.  I spoke to Liz Sager who, although she didn't directly work with her, got report from her old law firm of people that did, and Liz said to was extremely well liked, and very energetic. 
 I have a letter on its way to Mike Moscoso right now (interoffice mail).  We requested 5000 for nat gas any one month, but were only approved for an additional 2000.  So we went from 15,000 to 17,000.  Welcome back! 
 Attached is an updated list of the Confidentiality Agreements. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  I am not sending the list for 4/5/00 because all of the counterparties on that list were Credit declines. I have responded for Australia Legal on the 4/7/00 list.  Remember, no credit derivatives approved unless specifically indicated (which none are). 
 We do have it signed.  However, the Company's name was not correct in the agreement so I spoke to Wayne Greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead and change the name on the C.A. he signed, and I just wanted to get a copy back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his agreement. 
 Bob, can you send me a copy of the EnronOnline confirm so I can prepare this.  Thanks! 
 Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke. I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees. Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?  We sent execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on the inactive status. 
 I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email below.  Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response. MUCH THANKS!  For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.  What rules, besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off exchange trades you might enter into.  For instance, here in the U.S. energy commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options might be governed by the SEC.  Besides the exchanges your email reflected, what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might enter into? 
 I have not been getting a response from my outside the U.S. attorneys, so I just emailed them a reminder again, and tried to make them feel really guilty.  I hope that works! 
 Actually, we girls have that built in guilt gene, it just improves with age...but do I need to speak to your mother?  Is there anything you would like to confess...? 
 What can I say...?! 
 fax: ( 713) 646-3490 
 David,  What Australian laws besides the rules of the exchange would govern the trades? 
 Can you please prepare a print out for us of all the financial masters your records reflect and what type of agreement we have executed .  Thanks! 
 FYI,  To date, we have executed 21 amendments to ETA's. 
 We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement from the referenced counterparty and I have faxed it to counterparty today.  A copy will be sent to Dave. 
 Thanks for your response!  On online, when there are Australian counterparties I will just wait to hear from you and include your responses with mine (even tho you will  probably tell me they can only trade Australian power!).  Do you have a back up yet? 
 Oops, what a surprise!  When I went to file away my file on the CFTC Form 40, I noticed I already had a file in the regulatory cabinet where where had filed the form in 1995 and 1997.  Maybe we have to file these every other year? 
 We have received the executed Termination Agreement dated as of April 10, 2000 terminating the referenced trade.  Per the request of Jennifer de Boisblanc Denny, this termination was prepared because the customer hit the same product twice on EOL and two exact transactions were entered into the system.  I will send the original (fax) down to Bob Bowen for handling. 
 Attached is the referenced agreement.  Please do not hesitate to call me if I can be of any further assistance.  I am a paralegal in the Legal Dept.  My direct phone no is (713) 853-3399. 
 Mike,  Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment screen for the new products.  The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth  Thanks!  By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the master swap list.  I think I am going to need your help with that. 
 will someone be sending us the report? 
 I look forward to seeing you!  As soon as I get the recipes, I'll forward them on! 
 Who is Legal requested the master? 
 Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 for our luncheon.  Can you please confirm that that date is good for your group and also the total head count.  Suzanne will take care of ordering lunch for us.  Thanks! 
 Effective March 1, 2000, Aquila Energy acquired the assets of USGT (U.S. Gas Transportation Inc.) , with the acquiring entity being USGT/Aquila L.P.  USGT has assigned the Electronic Trading Agreement it executed with ENA to USGT/Aquila L.P.  A copy of the assignment will be forwarded to Frank Davis. 
 That envelope should probably go to Rob Milnthorp.  I'll have a copy walked down to John Lavorato here.  It is a list of all of our NYMEX positions, and the list should be provided by Rob to any traders trading NYMEX out of Canada. 
 What's your pleasure on the below guarantees? 
 I have nothing but the counterparty's request for assignment. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated April 12, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  For Tosco Refining Company, it should be set up as Tosco Refining Company, a division of Tosco Corporation. We need to get the incorporated entity on the hook. 
 There is an Australian counterparty on today's list. 
 No conflict with me.  I sent the date of the 24th to Anthony and asked him to confirm it with his people and get back to me. 
 Per our conversation, attached is the form of Amendment to the ETA, revised to reflect your correct name.  Also, while I was revising the document, I added today's date, and the page number and footer reflecting the document name.  Call me again at (713) 853-399 if you have any more questions, otherwise, I will await your fax of the signed amendment and bring it to one of our officers for signature. 
 Can you please add David Minns, a lawyer from our Australia office as an auhorized person with full privileges to the Master Swap Agreement Database (of course, only I should have keyword change and deletion ability). 
 tana jones will attend 
 Is your counterparty on today's list approved? 
 Edmund,  You are the only person I have now not heard from.  When can I expect to get your response?
