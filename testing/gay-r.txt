t he thinks I am pointing fingers.  Although I think the people with the authority also ultimately have to accept the responsibility, I think Laine has done an incredible job on many fronts simultaneously (and I have said so to Mariella when queried).  However, maybe this thing is just bigger than all of us. I just don't know any more.   It's true there is a lot of pressure and I'm sure Laine is absorbing most of the blows.  I have taken a lot of heat from Global Finance and Kishkill myself.  It's true that over the last 6 months I have not always been able to pay attention to the flood of e-mails this project generates each day. However, as you know, my style is to focus on a task with great intensity so I usually find the e-mails relevant to the issue I have square in my sights.  It's also true that on a number of occaisions I have been inadvertantly left out of the loop (such apparently was the case here).  I think it is unreasonable to assume that I have seamless communication with Tracee and Felipe or that these two young associates can even discern everything that is important. They are really struggling with the complexity of this project, everything is new to them, and they don't have the benefit of experience to know what is normal.  As a result, increased patience and communication are in order.  At this point I am trying to insure that the model we put in front of the lenders is credible and if we elect to present an undocumented issue in our favor than I want to be sure that I can defend the position.  I think we made great strides in toward developing a story which hangs together yesterday, although albeit in a painful fashion.  I want to reassure both you and Laine that I am committed to getting this done, I no longer have anything on my plate but this, and I am not going to break ranks when questioned by  the numerous folks nosing around.  The tough projects are what determine what we are made of.  I am comfortable with you forwarding these comments to Laine at your discretion. 
 Could you please take a moment to rspond on the attached. Thanks You 
 Thanks Christiaan,   but, why not 2 combustion turbines at 90 MW's each and the steam turbine fro whatever we can get?

 Robin I have a conflict with this date because this is the time for the Global Finance PRC which I will need to attend. Thanks. 
 P.S.  I'd like to rear end you too. 
 Phone number at Enron is 713-646-7582  Address:  Rob Gay Enron 333 Clay Street Houston, TX 77002 
 Those dates are fine for me.  Copies of the docs will be sent your way shortly. 
 I am happy to sign but I'm not technically in the ESA chain anymore.  My understanding is that Britaldo has assumed this role.  If it will expedite things and Ben will accept my signatrure then I can sign. I don't want to step on anyone's toes. 
 Did I make you laugh? 
 Hi Chelsea,  How is it going.  I'm sure you are doing a fine job with the kids  Love  Dad 
 This is the document which controls our base equity contributions and our contingent support.  It is not the final version and is currently being turned to reflect the sponsor's comments from Friday 12/15/00 
 This is the sponsor undertakings which we commonly refer to as the Central Bank Indemnity. 
 Citibank commitment to purchase OPIC notes 
 Rick,  I understand from a statement attributed to Tony Apps that the pipeline is now delayed to May 24, 2001 from the previous April 7, 2001.  Is this your understanding as well? 
 I'm going to try and catch Chris Dutton tomorrow morning.  Regards 
 What is the date of the law referening the Furnas right to contract for=20 energy and does it apply to their ability to contract for long term capacit= y=20 without a bid? 
 Could you attempt to get Lucio to respond?  Thanks  Rob 
 Luis,  It may be important to substantiate officially Furnas' need to show 300MW available even if constrained.  Is there a way to demonstarte that from public records?  Secondly.  can you provide the technical description of the system constraints and what is involved in overcoming them.  For instance does a new transmission line have to be built or new transformer installed? How long would it take to obtain these or other items and correct the problem? 
 Sorry, I meant Lucio 
 Rob's EGF page completed. 
 Blanca What is this all about.  The timing here is really bad for all of these folks, many are on vacation 
 It's getting pricey, especially on the fee side.  But what are the options at this point. Peter informs me that we  have been limited on talking to banks which pretty much dilutes our leverage.  I also think that the person doing the negotiating has no accountability to her clients.  I think you should scream bloody murder (perhaps to the new bosses of the region) This is going to be a huge drain on the P&L. 
 Did you forget me? 
 I will be in the Global Finance PRC all day tomorrow so can you present Guille in the ESA Directors/ GM PRC? 
 Thanks for the Book. I think I will enjoy it immensely in retirement. Merry Christmas and best of luck to you in the new year and the new job.   Regards,  Rob 
 This will be fine 
 For once I remembered.   Hope you have a good one and all is going well.  It was nice to see ya'll at Christmas.  Tell Terry that Mom and Laurie loved the trunks.  I was quite happy with the A&M cardholder as well so let Jason and Erin know for me.  Too bad the Aggie lost that wild one in Shreveport (could you believe that snow).  Conrats again on your appointment to the board of the KofC.  Hope 2001 is a superb year for you.  Regards,  Rob 
 Hi Jamie,  Tried to call you today to keep in touch but the phone just rang. Hope you are enjoying Indosuez.  I have announced that I am leaving Enron at the end of February when my contract runs out.  With them getting out of international infrastructure it is time to move on.  I am going to retire for a while and see how the life of leisure suits me.   Give me a call when you have a minute (713-646-7582).  Regards,  Rob 
 I would be happy to help.  What do I need to fill out or provide?   Maggie Li @ EES   01/03/2001 04:22 PM 
 Yes, 713-345-6003  Thanks 
 Why? 
 Jose, I think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history. However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as I understand it.  The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate. Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along the lines of:  1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements?  2) Could any consequential damages be assessed?  3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras?  4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement which was payable by EPE?  Could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis?  5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage?  6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the agreements?  7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under the PPA?  9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability?  10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance protect us in any of these instances?  (Note: the US$20MM Sponsor liquidity facility provides some comfort to the lenders)   John, stop me if you think I am off track.  If you have other questions which you think need to be addressed please continue .... 
 Sorry, I've been in all day meetings Mon & Tues.  I'll get to it early tomorrow.
