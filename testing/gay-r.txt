 Maybe just half a day for me. 
 Patti will definitely be out on Friday.  I am thinking about being out (I have a lot of vacation left). 
 Bob:  the only other thing I might add is that it makes a record of confirmed nomination information that may help in discrepancies (wrong contract #'s, etc.).  Otherwise, this is a great starting point.

 Toni:  can you please work up an offer for Josh Chapa for $60,000?  Do not make the offer until you hear back from me, but I would like to move on this asap.  Thanks. 
 Toni:  I've been gone the last few days, so could you give me an update as to where we are on Cynthia's offer and/or her response?  Thanks. 
 Toni:  I would like to extend an offer to Cynthia Lara.  I interviewed her last week.  The offer should be $58,000/year.  If you have any questions just let me know or contact Patti Sullivan @ x30494 or Bob Superty.  Thanks for your help. 
 Bob:  not too many new ones.  1.  Continued to see increased volumes and transactions on desk.  As of November, we have increased volumes to over 5 Bcf/day, up from about 2 Bcf/day last six month period.  We are continuing to handle month end close, and get all volumes scheduled daily.  2.  Continued to give support to the contract exchange project.  We have given my time and the resources from the group.  3.  Re-staffed the group after we lost some key, experienced personnel.  We have the new guys up and running and hope to really make some things happen from here on out.  If I think of any thing else I will let you know.  Thanks. 
 Jana:  go ahead and set me up to interview the people whose resumes I have received (I did receive them).  Thanks. 
 Jana:  I would definitely like to have an analyst start as soon as possible. Let me know what the procedure is (i.e. do I interview, will an anlyst just be assigned to me, etc.)  I had already talked to Mason Hamlin before, and he opted for another rotation, although he was perffectly acceptable to me.  So let me know what I need to do and when I could expect an analyst.  Also, a new hire analyst is acceptable.  Thanks. 
 You are awesome.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  we had no cuts attributed to the outage.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  here is our status from this mornings outage event.  NWPL:  we were able to manually input 80% of next days nominations.  Since we were not able to EDI, we will have to manually input all successive nominations for the day, as well as all actual scheduled volumes in Unify. We were also only able to get in our 80% of nominations with NWPL's help, as they extended the nomination deadline for us.  The other 20% of next day business will be nominated as an intra-day.  El Paso:  basically the same as NWPL..  We were able to manually get in 100% of nominations, but only because El Paso kept their system open an extra hour for us.  Let me know if you need aything else.  Thanks. 
 Jana::  I am the manager of West Desk Logistics, and I would like to start having analysts rotate into my group.  The gas trading desk director, Phillip Allen is also very high on this idea.  Could you give me a call so we could discuss?  I would like to get one of the new hires as quickly as possible. My extension is 31991.  Thanks. 
 Toni:  give me a call so we can discuss Josh.  Also, I need Cynthia Lara scheduled for interviews as soon as possible.  Thanks.  You can reach me at 31991. 
 Veronica:  per your request.  Thanks. 
 I guess whoever would like to.  Everyone seems to need people right now. Thanks. 
  kam:  do i need to do anything? 
 charles:  the 2.20 price is the correct price.  it was changed to reflect this.  let me know if you need anything else.  thanks 
 Kim:  attached are my more detailed remarks on citizens and the cuts.  please let me know if this will be ok.  thanks. 
 Stephanie:  scott never called back yesterday, after repeated calls.  I called him a few minutes ago, and he wanted his lawyers to talk to Gerald, before they make a deal.  So at least the ball is starting to roll.  Will let you know what happens.  Thanks   Randy
