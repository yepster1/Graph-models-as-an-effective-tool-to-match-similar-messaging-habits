 refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).  Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material default. 
 I believe that is correct. 
 I noticed on your web site that you have a number of Joana Zjawinska's for sale including "Love, Life  & Money Suite 2"  (which we currently own) and "Startled".  I was wondering if you would consider a trade where we would provide "Love Life & Money" (framed) and we would receive "Startled"? 
 As far as I know only the Hermes fee is refundable (less a small, unknown admin cost).  We may also have some fees payable, we will have to check. 
 Hi, we have been missing each other on the phone.  Were you able to trace the package?  My home Email is RGGDEE@AOL.com 
 The insurance has been purchased by Enron exclusively to cover our equity and our subd debt through our commercial program (not OPIC).  We  have covered the following investments to date on Cuiaba.  EPE                 $235MM GASMAT $  60MM GASBOL $132MM  Up to US$200MM could be reimbursed for an insuarble event.  However, that $200 may be limited by draws associated with insurable events at other projects.  This $200MM could be further limited by draws from other projects because the program has a cap of $250MM total, but the cap can be reinstated following a draw with an exclusion for the country where the previous hit occurred. 
 Thank you for the refund.  I am still hopeful you will be able to find the card.  Its a fine piece of history.  Regards,  Rob 
 I have attached my review of the electrical list.  This should allow us to have another discussion.  The ones with oK we want but I would like to discuss further your "costs" for these items because you have a separate mark-up. 
 He and I talked. You can stop bothering him for now. When we get him next week will extract our pound of flesh and we will make him buy the beer. 
 The address for St. Mary's church is as follows:  1612 East Walker League City, Texas 281-332-3031  If you could have your brick man see about the brick and the color of the mortar..  Thanks  Rob 
 When would you like to get together to go through the comments to the specs? 
 Thanks so much for the card, and remembering.  Regards 
 I'll touch base with the appropriate folks.  Regards,  Rob 
 will do 
 I think this will take about 1-2 hours.  It can be done by phone but in person would be better.  I would like to make sure that our documentation is clean before we start.  The specs have a lot of discrepencies with the drawings, the Bordeaux, and our contract.  Also, I am not sure that we each have a drawing of the electrical which matches and conforms to the lists we are working on with Bill.  I would also like to see whatever supplement we are going to sign to the contract so we can make sure that there are no misunderstandings on what is included. I think we have everything worked out but there are a lot of players and we all need to be on the same page.  I can make time to finish all of this just let me know what your schedule is (and Bill's, Joe's etc if they are needed).  Thanks 
 OK we are on.  I'll see you there. 
 I am interested. Would that be framed? I'll talk it over with my wife. 
 This is just to inform you that finally, this morning Carlos Miranda=20 (Superintendente de Hidrocarburos)  of SIRESE approved TBS-Transredes FT=20 Amendment and TBS-Andina/Maxus assignment. I=01%ll fax you a copy of the le= tter=20 as soon as we receive it. =20   Another CP met.   Regards   Rob 
 terrific,thanks 
 Could you then sell our Love Life & Money Suite.   Is this done on consignment or how do you operate.  We may also have some other artists to discuss because we are building a new home and we will have less wall space in some cases and different needs in others.  Thanks  Rob 
 I guess you got tied up on some real work.  Call me back when you have time. Are you happy?  The London job sounds great and sometimes the best things happen to us unexpectedly.   It was nice to hear your voice briefly.  I miss seeing you. 
 I need to take a day off if you do not mind Tomorrow, Friday Feb 9 to look after my son who will be out of school. Dee will be traveling with Chelsea to a dance competition. Call me on my cell if you need me. 
 On Friday we distributed  RFPs for securing bridge gas.   Letters went today to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.  We have given them until March 2nd to respond.  Pete Weidler will meet with YPF (hopefully with Ernesto Lopez Anad?n) the week of the 19th. 
 Ok.  Best of Luck - Rice is a good school.   Maggie Li @ EES   02/12/2001 10:25 AM 
 Thought you might be interested.  Cuiaba is really taking a toll.  Regards,  Rob 
 Call me when you have a minute.  Thanks 
 Sneak Preview     I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say about the Ridges and completion of the gas line in  connection with the financing. Also on the Interconnection issue we are still waiting on the Tozzini memo.  We either need to have someone riding herd on Tozzini on this (I thought it was Jose) or I need to go to SP and make this happen. 
 John, can you arrange this call?  Blanca can help make the arrangements. 
 Can you make 10 copies for the 10:00 AM mtg?  Thanks 
 There are prepayment penalties associated with IFC loans.  As to the lender Veto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and should not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered lenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks $40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the lender of record for the B banks).  Unanimous consent items would then require both OPIC and FMO to consent. 
 We will need to craft a response 
 We will provide the appropriate clarificatiions ASAP. 
 I was reviewing the pictures you sent.  You are not only an adventuress but also a Goddess.  Happy Valentines day.  I turned Pete down on the offer to stay.  I guess I'm just ready to move on and this feels pretty dead end here.  But I'll try and catch up with you from time to time if I can.  Beija  Rob 
 I have not been able to find out any details except that apparently he decided long ago that he would take some time off after becoming a partner and so now he is going to do it.  I have never received a call from Bob Draggon.  Should I still be expecting one or have you already convinced him?  Dan Castagnola is being requested as my replacement on Cuiaba and Peter Anderson is also being discussed.  I will be involved primarily to provide history and guidance, but it will be from my home or parts unknown.  You can feel free to call me at any time (281-334-2360).  I will be in the office here thru March 1.  Kindest Regards  Rob 
 Thanks. Same here. 
 I was thinking of you on the appropriate day but somehow I never managed to let you know how much I care about you. I'm thinking of you now too and hope you are happy and doing well.  Love  Rob 
 Could each of you please advise your availability to Blanca Bollom for this and Eddy could you coordinate with anyone from outside counsel who you think needs to be on such as V&E, Skadden, or Tozzini.  Thanks 
 She means Cliff Rankin. Can you see if he can make it. 
 confirmed 
 Hello my darling.  It is great to hear from you.   The photo brought back memories of a wonderful day with you. You are so beautiful.  I want to kiss you all over.  Love  Rob 
 In non-default situations the Lenders allow the banks to have rights and typically substantial input on waivers modifications etc.  As you can imagine the IFC would not want the liability of being responsible to B banks if they changed the deal without their consent and the B banks would e uncomfortable turning over that right to a third party.  They would lose control of the credit process. 
 Once again you made my day. You are really a wonderful person, you know?  Don't worry I'm not falling off a cliff - you will hear from me again.  Also I'll give you a call before I get out of here next week.  Lots of love,  Rob 
 Given the nature of the questions I agree verbal is the way to go.  I'll try and arrange. Is tomorrow ok? 
 We are headed for the abyss here, but we cannot keep this from the banks. Let's go ahead and get it on the table. 
 you are so fine!!! 
 Yes, we have not been able to pull Laine and Jose away from their very important activities on the Ridges, the Siemens negotiation and the Furnas/ Brazil Inc. efforts.  I think Eddie Daniels is going to try and start pulling the scedule together this week and next.  Thanks for the follow up.  Please let me know if the passage of time is endangering this effort.  Regards,  Rob 
 Brad, is there a time this week when you can do a conf. call to cover these questions?  Please advise.  Regards,  Rob 
 I have something at 10:30 but I will jump on as soon as I can. You go ahead though. 
 Thanks,  I'll pull it together and let you know what time. I'm shooting for tomorrow. 
 Nobody could do this today.  We will schedule for next week.  Regards,  Rob 
 Please note that all of the communications below are priveleged and confidential attorney client communciations.  What do you think the possible liabilities are from the Toxic Waste created below.  Ouch !!!  Maybe the attorneys need to conduct a seminar. 
 My e-mail is: RGGDEE@AOL.com  home phone is 281-334-2360.  Will advise of cel # when I get one (soon). 
 Donna:  what is Gay day?  I do not want to miss any significant events. 
 Ina:  from scheduling. the following people will attend tonight:  Suzanne Christiansen Patti Sullivan Matt smith Ted Evans Jan Sutherland Stacey Brewer Hillary Mack Shelly Mendel.  As you know, I will not be attending.  Thanks for everything. 
 You are a gentleman.  Just remember me for the closing dinner! 
 Diane:  if you could handle this please.  Thanks. 
 Phillp:  here is Richard's revised letter.  Let me know what you think. Thanks. 
 As discussed in Richards's prior memo, as discussed in Donna's prior memo, the scheduled quantities have now been turned off from now until midnight. 
 Bob:  not too many new ones.  1.  Continued to see increased volumes and transactions on desk.  As of November, we have increased volumes to over 5 Bcf/day, up from about 2 Bcf/day last six month period.  We are continuing to handle month end close, and get all volumes scheduled daily.  2.  Continued to give support to the contract exchange project.  We have given my time and the resources from the group.  3.  Re-staffed the group after we lost some key, experienced personnel.  We have the new guys up and running and hope to really make some things happen from here on out.  If I think of any thing else I will let you know.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August and beyond.  1.  We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's transport to be close to $1 million/ month.  2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.  3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time.  4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on management duties.  5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several different jobs at a time.  6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million to the desk. 
 Just anything you want me to know about to represent you would be fine.  I feel comfortable with where you are going to be placed, and can represent you just fine with Kam's input.  How are things going?  How's the baby.  Hope all is going well.  Take care.  Randy 
   Molly:  thanks.  I will be out this afternnon and tomorrow.  If you need anything let me know.  Thanks again. 
 Thanks  Well done. That's the best rate we have seen for some time. 
 George:  a rather cynical view, don't you think? 
 Bob:  we would be looking at El Paso an
