ok.   concentrate mainly on gas and power.  maybe some weather and products.  identifying any high risk/reward longer term vol trades we should be doing. 
 he'll be sitting with and reporting to me 
 director 
 it's going to take complete rejection of phys molecules to get solidly under $3.  i expect some really good chop for 2 weeks.  have enough people waiting for sub $3 to buy back all their shorts...don't think it's that easy from here,. 
 puts i assume.   for what months? 
 take-out, wine, and movie? 
 yes 
 how bout i bring it? 
 i need significant lead time to prepare for boots day.  please advise earlier next time. 
 how about you get the food 
 i'll get the movie and wine.  my suggestion is something from central market but i'm easy 
 John: Here is my analysis of my guys: Mike Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he ha= s run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the y= ear and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you= get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sol= d 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed b= y gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july = have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first = half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations= .  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little = too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money = in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curv= e shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicap= ped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Re= quired to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop John Griff= ith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often = has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs = to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' e= lses positions.  Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot f= unction without one of us on the desk. =20 Computer causing problems.  will email with other guys later. 
 any chance you can go to the game tonight?  i've got the good ones.. 
 interest in diamonds tonight?

 1.  Did API's indicate that there may have been switching from resid back to gas?  2.  Did the 2 crude traders that left quit or get fired? 
 Under new rules instituted this year by Commissioner Bud Selig, an umpire can automatically eject a pitcher if he believes he's throwing at a batter. He does not have to issue a warning before an ejection. Fletcher did not warn Mann for hitting Gonzalez or Cordova. "The umpire said Bartolo threw the ball at his head and that's an automatic ejection," said Manuel. "But the ball missed his head by three feet. It tipped off his bat." Colon said he wasn't trying to hit Servais. "I will protect my teammates," said Colon, speaking through bullpen coach/interpreter Luis Isaac. "I can hit anyone I want at any time. That's why I feel bad. I wasn't trying to hit him. The ball slipped." Fryman defended his pitcher. "At no point, do I approve of throwing at someone's head," said Fryman. "But that pitch did not surprise anyone in the ballpark. Bartolo should not have been ejected. There should have been an immediate warning to each bench. 
 i took a week and a half off during the same time that Bo Collins of EL Paso left so naturally I am going to El paso.  I'm not going anywhere unfortunately.  I'm in for July 31 if you've got them 
 David: Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances? 
 I have no good thoughts about the market.  everybody wants it to go down to 2.80 so I covered my short at 310-5.  cash very strong at these lower levels with some gen load.  should act to flatten curve as good producer selling in back.  playing range and selling vol.  think aga may surprise lower than expectations. 
 had phone problems ...lost my charger.  It was good.  I may be the most influential in the world of finance in the past 50 years 
 those certainly were the good ole days. 
 i really have no idea.  probably lower just becasue of the trend and overwhelming bearish view of the market. 
 what happened to you last night?  couldnt get ahold of you on your cell. 
 flat.  i had  my lowest var in over a year this morning 
 Kim: I will not be at the may 18 management mtg as I will be in NY on business. 
 that's fine.  the later the better but definitely after 2:30 
 I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective. 
 remind me of that bet again 
 me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness.  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong.  however, if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be, the turnaround will be very quick. 
 how about your local bank?? 
 selective memory maybe 
 if you're around stop by around 500-515 today to talk about all this stuff 
 Appreciate the offer but I won't be able to get out of work, 
 big plans tonight? 
 with? 
 yea...talk to john griffith about getting this info.  if you want to get a sense of my position, stop by monday afternoon. 
 i didnt mean to get so run over 
 yet his price forecast from last week is 2.60ish for next summer...is that the struggle between bullish next summer but coming out of the winter with a lot of gas in the ground? 
 what's your longer term 3-12 month view of heat?  thinking about buying against short natty for next summer. 
 think trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowing that tropical activity will develop at some point.  however, think the failure from 335 last thursday will weigh on people.  think that nobody wants to own above 325, only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 5-10 cents higher unless aga is very bullish. 
 if the number last week was right, then that looks possible.  however, 2 weeks ago the # came out higher than everybody thought so all the models were jacked up.  aga is certainly much better than the api but still cant put too much into one number 
 not really.  i actually don't think the market's going to move too much even though the range of expectations is huge.  there are enough people on the sidelines to mute a move either way 
 For extra credit.... If the company is worth 150% more under management A rather than 50% more, does your answer change? 
 me thinks below but won't really move until closer to expiry 
 i'm just here to do my job and not worry about prestige, or something 
 i probably would have told you within the first 2 months 
 Hey, Surprised to hear from you.  jeff is in charge of nat gas operations and reports to sally beck who is in charge of all back office ops.  as of this morn, he is still here.   i've heard some wacky enron rumors before but this one is pretty good.  where'd you hear this? 
 1. i would guess notional value $2-3 bil per day including financial derivatives. 2. probably doubled market share in gas since eol 3. probably 25% of our trades are intl 
 Can I assume we are ready to test the limit orders? 
 i would still like to conduct the test.  we may have 10-20 internal orders at a short interval after aga 
 thanks. 
 thanks for doing that interview for me.  can you reply to this? 
 you dont like my ideas 
 exaggerations...word travels everywhere doesnt it?  how'd you hear?  me thinks everybody short and everybody wants the market to go down.  I'm relatively flat and would love to squeeze all the fuckers out so I can sell them 20 cents higher. 
 i think there are so many shorts that some of the weak guys are squeezable here.  not all and not massive short covering.  just think the boys will be buying in front of next week's number.  best trade is to be long now and sell right before number 
 you're right about the email address.  thanks. as i said, if your product allows enron to reach more customers, we would have interest in participating in the structure. John 
 someone's got too much time 
 i just cant get too enthused about the short side.  why did cash go out trading +5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand.  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week.  fine.  what's it going to trade next week.  the gas daily swap implies flat, but it's lagged the actual spread all month.  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen.  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space.  so either the market is wrong (maybe but a dangerous assumption to make) or I don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve.  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high, but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast.  march is off 8 cents since jun 29.  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354, then why is sep too high at 298? 
 yea, i'd be willing to take a look at any of these ideas. 
 hey: thanks, we already have the front 2 spreads out (u/v,v/x).  do you think there would be interest in the strip spreads? 
 yea

 With the daily chaos that ensues on this floor, sometimes communication is sacrificed.  Fortunately, we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information.  I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well. 
 With skilling gone I move up one spot...from 147th to 146th.  This market sucks!!  Right back where we were before the # last week.  I have so little interest right now.  just glad i held onto the short straddle position.  wish i had something intelligent to say but i don't. 
 i'll pay a grand total of 0 
 in regards to the stock, tell me about it. flat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while. think the next push down doesnt come again until late october.  im buying z 300/250 put spread for 11.  still looking for 3.1 by end of season.  probably 2.95-3.0 for nov 31.  who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario? aga's... think high 70's is neutral the market.  if it comes out 70-85 you can shit on vol.  that'd be good for me. 
 hard to say odds on a revision.  don't think aga would make a revision, but an individual stg field could.  another option is that a stg field that realizes they fucked up just fades the number over the next several weeks such that each number going forward is bigger than expected.

 We have the whole curve out.  The nymex is just another trading platform that is inconsequential to markets we make except for arb opportunities and for the fact that our swaps settle against the nymex settlement.  our volume is pretty normal at this point. 
 i've been selling.  was long 500 and selling out.  everybody will  be expecting the crude draws.  they dont matter.  think this is tremendously bearish all energy demand.  supply shocks are the only question, but I dont think US will end up fighting a war against the middle east.  Who cares if we nuke afghanistan? 
 all I hear is that all the funds are going to get squeezed as soon as the nymex opens.  fuck, i don't know, but I'm not going get long crude hoping to squeeze the funds.  lost that game too many times. 
  huh? 
 the nymex is so technologically incompetent that they have no idea.   after working on it for 18 months they're trying to buy are technology now 
 if cash/futures is 10-15 then oct will have a very weak settle.  they are trying to use the regular access system on the internet which was supposed to come out two weeks ago but they delayed because the firewalls and security issues hadnt been solved 
 Scary how we have the same sense of humor.  Havent told anybody yet.  So I have a favor to ask: whether we never talk again, just become good friends, or grow old together with 6 kids, please never,ever refer to me as the energy guy.  You can refer to him as that, just not me. Officially tired of watching the news.  Actually there is very little new about it.  Channel 12: the local viewpoint.  CNN: the national viewpoint.  CNBC:  the business viewpoint.  ESPN: the sports viewpoint.  Pat Robertson Channel: God's viewpoint.  The politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing.  "We interrupt the State Dept's news conference to bring you the Justice Dept's news conference where we expect there going to say 'no comment at this time' frequently."  I have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens, but meanwhile it's driving me nuts. Just found out another girl I knew is missing. I was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through.  I met her after that. So let's talk about something better.  We'll start shallow.  What kind of music do you like? John 
 I don't remember him but it is my understanding nobody has been heard from that worked in the Carr office in the wtc. 
 Please call me in the morning so I can 3-way with an EOL technical rep to find out happened.  One looked at it this afternoon, and according to his preliminary analysis, the order was placed at 10:57 and never canceled.  Obviously that is counter to your knowledge of the transaction.  Let's straighten this out first thing in the morning. John 
 13 September 2001 3:28 PM  Hey, by the way, did you ever find your cell phone??? Network traffic very heavy right now so you might not get this until tonight. John 
 Gad: Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.

 i had to cover some.  too much risk.  rode most of it back down.  i think this whole event is bearish energy.... 
 nobody important 
 good point 
 your welcome 
 I'm going home.  Have fun tonight.  Talk to you tomorrow. 
 I see I've made quite an impression on you msled. 
 I created 2 new deals that reversed the deals mentioned. 
 So, well....I was thinking, um, you know.  Uh, never mind.  But actually, I was wondering (cough,cough) that, well.  Ok, I'm just gonna say it.  Are you you ready.  Ok, here it goes...  Would you like to get a drink some time?  J  p.s.--Whew, I was never good at asking girls out but I think that went pretty smoothly. 
       most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5. 
 i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here. 
 Agree with the first paragraph.  Bets get tougher from here.  Not so obvious and require much larger size to get same juice.  Generally not a good position considering the current world order, or disorder.  Not much juice in gas basis either.  This is where we see whether we are good traders or just great fundamentalists. 
 Hey: 1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state. 2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.  Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary. 
 P.S. - Can you bring me some free samples of the bladder control medicine.  It'll save me some money. 
 Please change my address of record to John Arnold 2000 Bagby #15403=09 Houston 77002  Thanks, John 
 you working out today? 
 I'm running out the door to go drinking with the boys at front porch, right next to my apartment.  I don't think your dad would like me so much.  Will explain later.  Sorry about your day.  Maybe you can find some happiness in the book of prayers.  Maybe you can find more happiness in the money.  Talk to you later. 
 wow...how did our guys do? 
 yea, that was for oct a couple hours before expiry.  dont have a whole lot of interest being fundamentally long crude.  maybe for a scalp buy if we get overdone which we might be this morn.  T Boone how? 
 are you going to the game 2 nite? 
 it wouldnt be fun if I were fair. 
 maybe they're for more sophisticated palates 
 Lucky sob 
 sorry,sorry,sorry Yesterday was just a little crazy.  Crude had it's biggest fall in 10 years so that translated into a very busy day.  Plus my best employee was just offered a job across the street for a big chunk of money.  At least I made money. I should be getting my phone line at home today (of course they've been saying that for 5 days now) at which point they can install dsl.  Thatll make it much easier. Went to the bb game again last night.  Love them stros. How'd you're presentation go last night? Did the doc talk good about your drug? Have a good one, Jonh 
 cold 11-15.  oct expires tomorrow.

 see you there 
 Seems a little out of whack but as we seen time and time again, fundamental relationships don't have to hold in the short term. 
 BBB+ credits dont go bankrupt overnight.  we can get downgraded overnight, though.  put a clause in the contract that if we get downgraded below inv grade there is some sort of orderly liquidation of the swaps.  talk to credit about how we handle this with others. 
 How about next wednesday?? 
 I actually went to go talk to him yesterday but he was already gone and he's on vacation today.  I'll talk to him next week.  Probably better for him to hear the benfits from my mouth.  We do need to talk to him before we get too far.  EOL working very well as of late. 
 there are few scenarios whereby that spread comes in except if you take it to settlement.  if dec is strong, jan is strong too.  if dec is weak, jan retains some risk premium. 
 it's an aquired taste 
 me thinks so 
 yep,  what are you doing later? 
 no thx 
 i think they worked this out. John 
 why is george down? 
 thank god i got out on friday.  had a much better month trading crude than gas. 
 yea 
 you coulda sent me this 8 months ago.... 
 i couldnt do it.  it took 13 minutes for my alarm to wake me up. 
 not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  just for market making skillset.  The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias. 
 Funny that they say mixed response to new ceo's 
 Someone in my group or myself will attend. 
 got your running shoes on? 
 mike maggi resigned this morning to take a job at a competitor.  He is under contract.  Lavo has been advised.  What do I need to do? 
 not really and no 
 ended up getting in late last night.  monday night football turned into tuesday morning football. 
 sucks to be mediocre, huh? 
 elpaso, same thing  Want to trade options? 
 outright long....a long time from now. looks like with cold weather curve is going to reshape.  front up, back nothing 
 is there a password or just knowing the address 
 hey buddy: heard you're in town.  any interest in going to the bb game tonight? have some right field homerun catching seats 
 Hello: Wondering if we can meet to pick up the tix.  I work and live in downtown.  Please advise or call me at 713-557-3330. 
 just got some tix in right field for tonight's game.  any interest? 
 why is anybody giving you scoop? 
 i think cash gets much stronger over the coming weeks relative to nov.  first inclination when cash comes up is that futures go up.  however, there is an 80 cent spread between cash and december.  cash can easily go up without dec moving. 
 just bot them.  I'll save one for you.  just let me know asap. 
 any interest in going to bb game tonight.  crude reunion.  jt, racecar, and me.  tix in HR #70 catching territory. 
 Sounds good.  I have cash.  I work at the old Enron building.  Just give me a call when you're close and I'll meet you on the street right in front of the building. 
 maybe we just hold all the gas until next winter.  we'll worry about that problem next september. novy expiry can go anywhere.  Too early to say.   Probably around $2 though as I cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the US is a net injector the first 1-2 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing. 
 Can you meet this guy if I'm off the desk? 
 i'm just kidding.  i'm getting a haircut from 530-600.  i'll call you when i get out. 
 For anybody that doesnt know, Maggi resigned today to go to El Paso.  I will be sending out an email with a broader distribution this afternoon.  Please keep this quiet until then.  Plan to meet at 4:30 today to discuss the ongoing structure of the desk. 
 I'm going to put out an email this afternoon 
 you suck.  how pissed will you be if the guy next to me catches 71.  call me before you leave tomorrow. 
 can you find out the scoop on ravi thuraisingham as far as reviews, rankings, etc.   thinking about hiring him. 
 me thinks people are trading the headline and not the story 
 ene: the india story.  I lok at it and say we sold india.  then realize we the gas, not the assets. 
 no.  waiting for a rally to sell.  if dont get one will stay out. 
 no.  Have had 2 late nights in a row and it doesnt get much better rest of the week.  had to get  an extra hour of beauty sleep.  can you tell? 
 I went to the Front Porch after the crappy game and then went back to my front porch with billy white.  he wouldnt leave.  stayed until 1:15.  get the feeling he doesnt get out much. 
 actually a terrible game.  bonds didnt get a ball out of the infield in the air.  granted we werent exactly pitching strikes to him. 
 you i guess. 
 not enough 
 come on up tomorrow afternoon. 
 yea 
 I would pay $300 for the tix tonight.  I feel ripped off for the crappy game I had to sit through tuesday. 
 yea, can you meet me at enron again? 
  Pull this up and click on hit chart http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?statsId=3918#    Your tix are sec 154, row 12, seats 1-4, on the aisle of sec 155 http://astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_seating.jsp 
 at least I made $100 for my services 
 can you email lavorato maggi's address 
 nope 
 going to the game.  I'll be at the front porch tomorrow... 
 drinks on tickleknees if you do 
 depends on the legal outcome.  thhere is still a possibility we get all of our money back, although a roe of 0% for 10 years.  Still, a better roe than broadband investments 
 can we meet at 4:00 instead? 
 because we're $10 off the lows or because you think we're overvalued? 
 what do you think now? 
 you doing anything tonight? 
 no need.  the drinks will be warm by the time I get back up to the 6th floor. 
 yes, he'll be at work on monday.  can you have docs ready sometime during the day?  by the way, these are crappy pics.  The prediction company says you go 4-7. 
 2-9 YOU'RE A HACK 
 Eddie Gaetchens (?), Marty, and Kevin from Man are coming down Wednesday if anybody is up for dinner or drinks 
 maybe we need a closer in that seat 
 want to play hookie and go to the bb game tomorrow at noon? 
 no way.  we're still paying $5000 for new employee referrals 
 they're giving away a porsche boxster or a cardboard boxcutter? 
 my little junior league girl.   so sweet. let's leave around 1130ish 
 she starts at 12:12 
 sure.  just call me when you get out 
 jeans 
 I'm wearing a shirt too 
 maybe after the game. 
    most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5. 
 how about we celebrate the near completion of your deal and have tickleless pay for it. 
 I never knew your fantasies... 
 Do you want to drink beer?  I'll work on sneaking a bottle of Opus in otherwise. 
 Not so impressed with David goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivatives for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyonnais for a while.  The only value I see in him is that he worked at BP for a while and might have some knowledge as to how they work. 
 that was pretty funny. Do not still have the double date thing.  I need a favor in return for interviewing your boys.  Remember Mark Findsen.  He's looking to get back into the business, possibly from the trading side.  I actually think he might make a better orig guy.  He has been in the crude and products markets for 10+ years.  Has no experiece in trading energy but has been day trading equities for past year.  He asked if he could get a round of interviews at Enron.  Could you set up a round for him? 
 maybe,  some specialization is beneficial though. 
 sounds like it's clean from your side.   I HATE SWAPTIONS!! 
 If these problems are not being addressed as they should be, call me and I'll get on it.  This is unacceptable. 
 Sorry,sorry, sorry. Havent had internet access at home for past 5 weeks.  Much easier to write these at home as when I'm done trading I don't want to look at my computer. For november, very neutral.  Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching, and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with cash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt, the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents at settlement.  Been buying a lot of y/y cantango as I think next summer will be a piece but longer term gas story still very real and customers know it.  Wouldnt be surprised to see 2/3 go to 50+.  I think x has some room to go up, but not a lot.  Dont want to play the market from the long side as been burned before trying to get long a market that is still in a downtrend.  Seems like the curve will just keep rolling down with each expiry.  All the winter months might settle 2.25.  As such, the best thing to be short is jan. 
 LOSER 
 what's brian's last name? 
 is that with or without two snoozes? 
 bad mormon brian 
 Johnny: I'll get Mark Findsen to call you.  Can you have at least 1 trader interview him as well. Thanks, John 
 Savita: Any chance we can introduce limit orders to spreads? 
 Sushi on Thursday at the new place in the Village? 
 going to the game? 
 cancel above.  we'll do it next week 
 got whalley's for today at noon.  can you go?

 I just found a taker. Sorry.

 I'm in. 
 can you make a reservation for 8 at vallones at 6:30 today. 
 sorry, just got your msg.  cant go today. by the way, you're a lousy friend. 
 don't worry about it 
 I'm sure he'll come down whenever we ask.  Should I tell him to get his butt down here and show us the love? 
 your welcome.  It was really good to see you again.  Maybe we can so something again before 2 months 
 All good 
 He should call you today or tomorrow morning.  I do not have a list of interviewers in mind.  I would like Bill White to talk to him though. Thanks. 
 Jennifer: I don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it primarily pertains to our views of the market.  I would speak in such generalities that it probably wouldn't be a good interview. John 
 Hey: That's one hell of a bd celebration.  Don't think I can hang in you guys. Was definitely a little sleepy yesterday.  Went to the bb game and then had a biz dinner last night.  I was almost asleep driving home at 8:30.  At least I was sane enough to yell buy and sell at random points during the day. 
 I assume you're going to let people select news categories such as us energ= y news and avoid articles about paskistani oil fields. 
 Any time tomorrow afternoon around 3 or 4:45 to discuss? 
 Just following up to see if the recruiting season has started and to make sure everything is going okay.  If you need anything, just say the word. 
 I've got a mtg from 4-4:30ish so either before or after 
 If you have blackberry, keep me informed about pira 
 ng lows in place but q1 forecast $2.2  ??? don't understand. also, what's longer term forecast i.e. past mar 03 
   --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 you goofball  go to www.snopes2.com , click on rumors of war, and then go to the first en= try about halloween. 
 that night i had so  much brain damage i couldnt function.  as opposed to ???? 
 yes 
 what is our flight schedule for monday? 
 any substance to their argument or just their beliefs. 
 The y/y spreads have come in decently over the past week and a half.  The 2/10 spread has moved from 104 to 94.  It may be a good time to move the 3-10 to a cal 2 trade.  Pira just gave their seasonal conference in NY and they are very bullish long term gas. Pira's forecast		Nymex Cal 2 	2.45		2.99 Cal 3	3.00		3.31 Cal 4	3.70		3.40 Cal 5	4.00		3.48 Cal 6	4.10		3.57 Cal 7	4.20		3.66 Cal 8	4.30		3.75 Cal 9	3.60		3.84		(TransAlaska Highway Pipeline) Cal 10	3.80		3.93 3-10	3.84		3.59  Regardless of what you think of Pira and long term price forecasts, the rest of the market does listen.  They have a tremendous amount of respect in the industry and affect how customers and producers hedge.  The flow, which has been buyers over for the way backs, I think will get more pronounced, especially if the front goes down.  In the past week, I've sold Duke 40,000/d Cal 6-10 and 25,000/d Cal 7-10.  I've sold PGE maybe 30,000 day Cal 4-5.  The only seller has been El Paso whom I believe is hedging production.  He is trying to pressure the y/y spreads as a spec trade that I think was/is being done to front run the corp hedges.  I've used it as an opportunity to put a lot of spreads away for inventory down the road.  If you want to buy this strip back in the next 6 months, I think it's going to be much easier/cheaper to roll it closer. 
 which way? 
  [Arnold, John]  We're working out today at 4:30 
 i guess i have to keep my 395 price target.  just nothing bullish in the near term except crude.  and that's not enough now.  need to get to a new price regime to pick up more demand quickly. 
 I hated it 
 1.  I'm going to see T Boone Tuesday  2.  Fine me for Var for Friday.  I promise I'll buy on Monday. 
 How about 7:00 
 Joey: Can you round the price of following EOL deals from 10/9 with Cargill to four decimals while keeping the spread price the same: 1985332 1985333  Thx, John 
 no clue.  not a movie buff. 
 5-3-2 +255 - 120 = 135 your way 
 What money?  I don't know what you're talking about 
 I'll get it at lunch. 
 damn, thought you forgot 
 exactly 
 none 
 you got robbed...  -35 
 it's the one thing that could really hit the market.  There are a lot of gas hedges on against those trades.  If they are torn up, a lot of gas in the back gets sold off hard.  Plus, The dynegys of the world lose $1 on their hedges. 
 tom o'grady - aquilla - 861-527-1564 
 me, me, me....you girls are all the same 
 do you have any time today around 5? 
 Darren: I think Dutch Quigley spoke to you about an individual who is trying to get set up with EOL for his personal account.  The person is Tony Annunziata from the Smith Barney AAA fund.  He meets the suitability tests as far as net worth and knowledgable investor.  He is also willing to post via LC or wire.  I gave him your number.  I would appreciate if you could expedite his credit application.  Thanks, John 
 stg adjusted means factoring in cost of carry and taxes stg curve looks more realistic in market areas when you add basis on. 
 Tell him I'm free to meet Oct 19, 2085 at 2:00 AM.  See if that's ok with him. 
 I referred him to Lavorato 
 Liz: Just wanted to thank you for the astros playoff tix.  Thanks for thinking of me.  Maybe you'll invite me up to see your new digs before the move.... John 
 your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this level though. 
 This guy is working on an EOL project for me right now.  Can you send him a file with our EOL trades for today or yesterday with product, price, buy/sell, and timestamp but counterparty names deleted 
 3:00 up here 
 I want to have a group mtg from 4:00-5:00 today to discuss some of the enron issues and then vol if we have a chance. 
 so how'd it go in NY? 
 Just wanted to thank you for the gift basket.  I usually don't like them because they have crappy wine, but that was actually a really good bottle.  Sat out on my patio last night drinkning
