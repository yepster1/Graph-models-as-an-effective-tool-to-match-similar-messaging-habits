 they cant see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this level though. 
 only if you promise to post regular updates on the trucking market.  call chris gaskill to get the password. 
 will see you there (most probably) 
 Hey Adam: sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in touch, john 
 this is my idea of vacation... 
 Hello: I am not able to pull up the link for the short term outlook for natural gas.  Can you please make sure the link is updates. Thanks, John 
 yes i will 
 do you know what my user id and password are? 
 i like that feeling...as long as someone doesnt punch you in the gut.  i'm going to san antonio at lunch today to play soccer so i just took the day off.  catching up on 2 weeks of email.   i know how to relax don't i 
 absolutely...though i'm not sure how you do it.  call chris gaskill and he should be abl to help. 
 Jeff: To explain the P&L of -349,000  : We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000. The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.  Looking out for you bubbeh: John 
 almost forgot about you.... will take care of .  we'll keep you guys together close to the traders. 
 no 
 Stranger: Any interest in getting a drink or dinner Tuesday?  havent seen you in forever. 
 Stephanie: Please set up Mike Maggi for trding on Intercontinental Exch. Thanks, John 
 my email as far as i know is jarnold@enron.com.  not on msn though. i made space for your 8 people as well as ferries, roberts, and the other person (??) you requested.  Come down tomorrow and i'll show you the layout again. john 
 can you take care of this... 
 Jean: I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further.... thanks for the article. john 
 would like to meet to review to make sure i understand.  may only take a couple minutes.  are you free at 330 on tuesday? 
 remind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year.  granted it won't behave that way again until close to expiry, but i like the j/k outright much moreso than the condor. 
 can you get me the number of our contact at the Delano.  I have a personal favor to ask them. john 
 pookie: check this out: www.sailmainecoast.com/index.html

 kimberly: any interest in accompanying me to maggi's bd party sat nite? 
 welcome to the world of electronic market making. ..      it's fun ,huh? 
 sure 
 may be looking to sell some naked calls soon.  can you check that i would be approved to sell 200 of either 65 or 70's expiring somewhere between jul-jan. also, if i sell naked calls with a tenor of more than one year that expire worthless, do the gains get counted as LT cap gains? 
 sure, how about thursday at 3:30?   would like to get update on ENE's lng projects as well.   Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   04/24/2001 07:28 AM 
 my numbers from mar 15.  would raise jun-augy by 10 cents because of the supportive weather we had from mar 15-apr 15 
 are we first?  if not, when does the road show start and/or when does the basic theme get distributed around the industry? 
 1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor. 2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity. 3. the obvious 4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall. 5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably. 
 can you send jean a list of her seat numbers 
 thanks a lot 
 awfully close...... 
 yes 
 yep 
 fuck you 
 do you mind if i go out with the boys from work tonight? 
 Hello, I noticed you carried several of the 98 Zoom Zins.  Any chance you have the 33 year old vines version?  Please advise, John 
 you think i'm going to put this in ellectronic form?  no way. 
 Mike: Please resend the forms needed although I may have sent the necessary docs with the courier that delivered the check.  Do not believe we've seen the worst yet.  Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a while.  Even with the rally today I do not believe we've seen the worst yet. 
 Please send it to me. john 
 jeanie: i really need the docs on both phantom stock and options. please please please  john

 7:2 at 2:1 
 That's what I'm talking ABOUT !!!! 
 mike: just want to confirm you received my money and forms. also, checking to see if i am set up to sell naked calls on ENE.  may be looking to do something this week.  probably 100-200 contracts. john 
 the 14 mm loss was due to a booking mistake that could not be corrected before the books were posted and is being corrected tonight 
 fuck you 
 i'll take 10:1 this morning 
 schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out. 
 eat my shorts 
 fuck you 
 Is it possible to reschedule the commercial meeting from Wednesday. Wednesday is the busiest day of the week for the gas floor.   Please advise, John 
 fuck you 
 fuck you 
 i dont remember if we fixed these yet. 
 the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1. that's all the juice i'll pay. 
 Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front frequently. 
 Dave: I need a favor.  I'm trying to create an internal only Cal 2002 product for our power guys. Product controls is saying it will take  a week from monday to get it created.  any way to speed it up? 
 the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different. 
 what kind of odds.   the market is saying it's 8:1 chance.  I'm saying there is a much better chance than that.  i think it's 2:1 
 2.75 ... but yea 
 may = 495  the rest is the same 
 Errol: I did not write up these access trades from Friday.  Please make sure they are in. John 
 looks good to me.  have you sent for materials yet? 
 i went to get the tix this morn and couldnt get them.  i'll probably go to dinner.   sorry 
 australia definitely sounds cool.  might be a little tough though. i'd be in for keemah if you want to do that 
 http://gasmsgboard.corp.enron.com/msgframe.asp 
 yes 
 fuck you 
 hey: just wondering if you're still up for sailing lessons and if you've found out anything??? 
 what time did you get in? 
 Took the wrong checkbook to work Friday.  Will call your courier on Monday hopefully. John 
 what's your view of crude from here over next 1-4 weeks? 
 agree 
 good to me.  get prices for the different types of rooms 
 got tix for tonight 
 assume we're driving the 328 up to mom this friday after work 
 assuming we're driving the car to dallas tomorrow after work... 
 liz: are the diamonds still available for tonight's game? 
 yea they were doing spoofs on the rules of business.  i'll tell you about it later.  kind of funny.   however, it took 2 hours for 30 seconds of film 
 arrive some time friday night. leave some time sunday. 
 do you still have the magazine and if so can you send it to me? 
 i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer versus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 and contango for natty? 
 Mike: Two questions regarding fees: 1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type investment into the hedge funds? 2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity. However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?  Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my above-market returns compromised by high fees. Thanks, John 
 planning on going.  which night are you inviting guys for?  also, heard there were some issues about contract negotiations.  don't know specifics but if you want to discuss give me a call.  might be able to mediate this a little bit  if you want. 
 good to hear.  met john galperin today.  give me a call soon to  dicuss how to most effectively use the line. 
 please add 
 maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is that relevant. 
 i talked to fred today.  i think he's in so lets assume it's a go.   when is the last day to cancel and get our money back? 
 no actually i was here until 700  ... filming a movie 
 unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation. second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution. third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade. if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this helps, john 
 Congrats, thought you were headed to aig.  how long til you get to short natty again? 
 txu buy 200 u @5255 
 are you in for the game? 
 i've realized i'm too old to stay up til 1 on a school night 
 no not necessarily... just sick of her at the moment, 
 i may have some u2 tix for tonight,   wanna go? 
 you think that's a valid excuse?   whatever.... 
 you're right though...it seems like bo and i are always on the opposite side of each other. 
 fyi : bo is a big put buyer and fence seller today.  though he is trying to defend j. 
 In regards to gas: what signals do you for in determining your view? what resources do you use to formulate a price view? give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer. where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest level we've been at in past 5 years? what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market? what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? What do you expect in the next 5? how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given day?  In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty What are delta/gamma/theta? if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero? Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts? If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal? what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if corresponding futures are trading $5? what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase? 
 Ina: Can you set up a 5 minute mtg with me and all of the assistants and runners in regards to what we discussed this week 
 thanks 
 I understand you are out of one of the wines.  Please fill remaining order. thanks, john 
 Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way. Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up. 
 As long as I own Enron stock, the desks are my colleagues.  Feel free to share the info with Hunter and Chris.     Clayton Vernon @ ENRON 03/26/2001 03:45 PM 
 Kim: Can I get  4 tix for the following games: Apr 21 or 22 vs. St Louis Jun 15 vs Texas Jun 17 vs Texas Thanks, John 
 thanks, i'll check it out 
 use 380 
 http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp 
 will call you tonight 
 where are you getting those numbers? 
 yes i dont know.  both have their merits 
 Mike: which one of the hedge funds closes today? 
 yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds, eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y/y surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists for rest of winter.  by late december, just trying to find a home for gas. think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle. 
 just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me. weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down. spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we haven't moved down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.-when we start beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will get short. customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we're coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be strong. when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the mrkt just a timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400. 
 We ahave not initiated a 24/7 gas product yet but are creating the capabilities to launch at some point in the near future 
 hey podner: where are you buying me dinner tonight? 
 maybe a drink after work...

 Do you have interest in having a semi formal party at the guggenheim for our ny counterparties?  was thinking it might be a good pr move.
