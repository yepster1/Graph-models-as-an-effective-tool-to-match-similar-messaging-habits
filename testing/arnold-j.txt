 Vlady: Can I  add 3 more portfolios:  1.     +1000 July 2003 Chicago Basis - 1000 July 2003 Panhandle Basis  2.     +1000 June Henry Hub Cash  3.      +1000 June Henry Hub Cash - 1000 July Futures  Thanks, John 
 yes 
 Vlady: In preparation for our discussion tomorrow, can you run VAR numbers for some mini-portfolios:  Portfolio 1.   +1000 November Nymex -1000 December Nymex  2.     -1000 July Nymex Straddles  3.     +1000 July 2002 Nymex  4.     +1000 July 2002 Nymex - 1000 August 2002 Nymex  5.     +1000 July Socal Basis  6.     +1000 July Chicago Basis -1000 July Michcon Basis  7.     +1000 July Henry Hub Index  8.     +1000 July 2003 Chicago Basis  Again, these are separate portfolios.  I'm trying to check that the VAR numbers make logical sense. Thanks, John 
 Tickets requisitioned for England/Germany.  $1500!!!!!! 
 Tanya: On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing.  I was under the impression that you could apply this vol curve to the price book and storage book and have a new experimental VAR number by Monday. I have not received any response.  Please reply with status of this project. John 
 Please use this vol curve for a dry run to figure out var for my book, NG price, and Jim's book, Storage, and communicate the results.  Thanks,John 
 Can we meet at 5:00 today? 
 Let's meet at 4:00. 
 Hey: Hope you're enjoying the Holidays.   I don't have your cell phone #, so call me if you get bored this week.  Sorry I didn't return your call Monday.  I'll be in the Big D.  You can reach me on my cell or, better yet, at 972 934 3440. Adios amigos: John 
 Stupid taxes 
 Please do not send these emails anymore.  I am not Jennifer Arnold 
 Kevin: Come by Tuesday between 5:00-5:30 if you still want to see the new spreadsheet.  However, it may be more valuable to talk to Dutch Quigley, who runs my risk, as he built the system and understands the vertical integration better. John 
 Please take me off your mailing list 
 Doug: To confirm the pricing of the LNG dela::  I can show a $3.01 bid for the Nymex portion of 160,000 mmbtu/day for the time period Jan 2003-Dec 2014.  The bid on Henry Hub basis for same time period is -$.0025 resulting in fix price of $3.0075; the bid on Sonat basis is -$.0175 translating into a bid of $2.9925.  Notional volume = 70,128 contracts. PV volume = 37,658 contracts. Exposure per $.01 move = $3,760,000  John 
 Hey, I just got your email. Call anytime after 4:00. Obviously, I don't read my email very often 
 Please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address: jarnold@enron.com. You have the wrong person 
 eat shit 
 Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit confused by the question. In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas. Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. John 
 Andy: The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options. Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money. Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.  In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction. 
 Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote? 
 Thanks for taking me in last night.  Sorry about being drunk and stinky. My cab, that we called at 6:10, showed up at 7:02.  I was so pissed. 
 Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market. Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. John 
 call me if you're in town this weeekend

 Please approve Larry May for a trader id on EOL for "pipe options" book for US gas. Thanks, John 3-3230 
 Andy: This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going forward.  Thanks for the feedback. John Arnold 
 Please approve.

 call me when you get this 
 I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time.  The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them 
 I am free at 3:30 on Thursday at my desk. 
 sounds good 
 Hey: Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there. interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand. market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low. Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 considering the scenario that's being painted.

 mark: what are your thoughts on crude and gasoline? 
 most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.

 don't make me type the math on the computer pooks 
 probability   * payout = 1 heads         .5  0 = 0 tails  2 heads        .25  1  = .25 tails  3 heads     .125  2 = .25 tails  4 heads   .0625  4 = .25 tails  5 heads .03125  8 = .25 
 i think it's 100 
 Expected value of game = 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * 1 + 1/8 *2 + 1/16 *4 +1/32 * 8+.... = 0       +.25  +.25 +.25 +.25  +... = infinity

 fill in $ _____ per/share 
 and your offer? 
 rules to a game: You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what you charge me play against you?) 
 no crap, what's your bid? 
 i need significant lead time to prepare for boots day.  please advise earlier next time.

 Russell: Just fyi, they're willing to take us for 20 years. 
 i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here. still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here. 
 maybe they're for more sophisticated palates

 Jennifer: I don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it primarily pertains to our views of the market.  I would speak in such generalities that it probably wouldn't be a good interview. John 
 that night i had so  much brain damage i couldnt function.  as opposed to ???? 
 i guess i have to keep my 395 price target.  just nothing bullish in the near term except crude.  and that's not enough now.  need to get to a new price regime to pick up more demand quickly. 
 none 
 your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this level though. 
 Alan: I received your email.  I'll make sure it goes through the proper channels. It may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as Enron is such a big place, it will help focus the resume to the right people. John 
 only if you promise to post regular updates on the trucking market.  call chris gaskill to get the password. 
 will see you there (most probably) 
 Hey Adam: sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in touch, john 
 this is my idea of vacation... 
 yes i will 
 do you know what my user id and password are? 
 i like that feeling...as long as someone doesnt punch you in the gut.  i'm going to san antonio at lunch today to play soccer so i just took the day off.  catching up on 2 weeks of email.   i know how to relax don't i 
 absolutely...though i'm not sure how you do it.  call chris gaskill and he should be abl to help. 
 Jeff: To explain the P&L of -349,000  : We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000. The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.  Looking out for you bubbeh: John 
 I almost forget about your debt, but then your BMW 315ia reminded me of it. 
 almost forgot about you.... will take care of .  we'll keep you guys together close to the traders.

 Stranger: Any interest in getting a drink or dinner Tuesday?  havent seen you in forever. 
 my email as far as i know is jarnold@enron.com.  not on msn though. i made space for your 8 people as well as ferries, roberts, and the other person (??) you requested.  Come down tomorrow and i'll show you the layout again. john 
 can you take care of this... 
 Jean: I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further.... thanks for the article. john 
 would like to meet to review to make sure i understand.  may only take a couple minutes.  are you free at 330 on tuesday? 
 remind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year.  granted it won't behave that way again until close to expiry, but i like the j/k outright much moreso than the condor.

 my numbers from mar 15.  would raise jun-augy by 10 cents because of the supportive weather we had from mar 15-apr 15 
 are we first?  if not, when does the road show start and/or when does the basic theme get distributed around the industry? 
 1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor. 2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity. 3. the obvious 4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall. 5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably. 
 Stephanie: Please set up Mike Maggi for trding on Intercontinental Exch. Thanks, John

 remember when you said there is a reason they call them bear spreads?  bring up a chart of f/g or g/h. f/g is tighter now than anytime since march 99 when ff1 was worth 2.50   amazing 
 yep 
 i'll take 10:1 this morning 
 schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out.

 fuck you 
 fuck you 
 fuck you 
 i dont remember if we fixed these yet. 
 the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1. that's all the juice i'll pay. 
 Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front frequently. 
 Dave: I need a favor.  I'm trying to create an internal only Cal 2002 product for our power guys. Product controls is saying it will take  a week from monday to get it created.  any way to speed it up? 
 the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different. 
 what kind of odds.   the market is saying it's 8:1 chance.  I'm saying there is a much better chance than that.  i think it's 2:1 
 2.75 ... but yea 
 may = 495  the rest is the same 
 looks good to me.  have you sent for materials yet?

 arrive some time friday night. leave some time sunday. 
 do you still have the magazine and if so can you send it to me? 
 i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer versus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 and contango for natty? 
 Mike: Two questions regarding fees: 1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type investment into the hedge funds? 2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity. However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?  Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my above-market returns compromised by high fees. Thanks, John 
 planning on going.  which night are you inviting guys for?  also, heard there were some issues about contract negotiations.  don't know specifics but if you want to discuss give me a call.  might be able to mediate this a little bit  if you want. 
 what time did you get in? 
 good to hear.  met john galperin today.  give me a call soon to  dicuss how to most effectively use the line. 
 please add 
 maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is that relevant. 
 i talked to fred today.  i think he's in so lets assume it's a go.   when is the last day to cancel and get our money back? 
 unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation. second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution. third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade. if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this helps, john 
 Congrats, thought you were headed to aig.  how long til you get to short natty again? 
 txu buy 200 u @5255 
 yea they were doing spoofs on the rules of business.  i'll tell you about it later.  kind of funny.   however, it took 2 hours for 30 seconds of film 
 are you in for the game? 
 i've realized i'm too old to stay up til 1 on a school night 
 no not necessarily... just sick of her at the moment, 
 i may have some u2 tix for tonight,   wanna go? 
 you're right though...it seems like bo and i are always on the opposite side of each other. 
 fyi : bo is a big put buyer and fence seller today.  though he is trying to defend j. 
 In regards to gas: what signals do you for in determining your view? what resources do you use to formulate a price view? give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer. where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest level we've been at in past 5 years? what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market? what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? What do you expect in the next 5? how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given day?  In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty What are delta/gamma/theta? if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero? Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts? If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal? what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if corresponding futures are trading $5? what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase? 
 Ina: Can you set up a 5 minute mtg with me and all of the assistants and runners in regards to what we discussed this week 
 thanks 
 I understand you are out of one of the wines.  Please fill remaining order. thanks, john 
 no actually i was here until 700  ... filming a movie 
 Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way. Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up. 
 As long as I own Enron stock, the desks are my colleagues.  Feel free to share the info with Hunter and Chris.     Clayton Vernon @ ENRON 03/26/2001 03:45 PM 
 Kim: Can I get  4 tix for the following games: Apr 21 or 22 vs. St Louis Jun 15 vs Texas Jun 17 vs Texas Thanks, John 
 thanks, i'll check it out 
 http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp 
 will call you tonight 
 where are you getting those numbers? 
 yes i dont know.  both have their merits 
 Mike: which one of the hedge funds closes today? 
 you think that's a valid excuse?   whatever.... 
 yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds, eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y/y surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists for rest of winter.  by late december, just trying to find a home for gas. think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle. 
 just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me. weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down. spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we haven't moved down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.-when we start beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will get short. customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we're coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be strong. when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the mrkt just a timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400. 
 We ahave not initiated a 24/7 gas product yet but are creating the capabilities to launch at some point in the near future 
 maybe a drink after work...

 yes but getting haircut until 700.  is it too dark then?

 Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis. 
 Andy: Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you want to discuss.

 hey podner: where are you buying me dinner tonight? 
 wanna bring me back to work?    Matthew Arnold  03/19/2001 03:25 PM 
 just got it today.   thanks 
 you'll be happy to know i get my car back today 
 dinner this week?  i'm free mon-wed 
 On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our customers get lost in the crowd? Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok? 
 remove me from your email list 
 cash goes out trading +1 to +3  j/k a piece 
 i have a very pretty back of the head  cash went out around 2-4 back yesterday. today it is 3 back right now bo trying to sell j/k at 4.5 on the open 
 so argument more switching than outright lost demand?    where are petro prices on a comparable equivalence? 
 heffner a little bullish, eh? 
 come by whenever 
 Stinson: Can we do the meeting today at 4:00? 
 agree with contango story .   cash to futures pretty bullish but a picture where agressive inj now are bearish later.  so curve should flatten.  also back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.  customers will be buying all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.  contango has been under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion. definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.  surprised we havent gotten more demand back as we sit at these lower levels. off to cabo today for a long weekend.  kind of exhausted at work right now so a much needed break. 
 houston would be easy    ireland kinda tough 
 71 
 Sorry, have no idea. 
 very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year. 
 what are you doing tonight? 
 what are you doing tonight 
 how about benjys? 
 that's fine     Heather Alon 11/01/2000 12:59 PM 
 just a vicious rumor... my birthday's not till next year. 
 it was almost worth buying a ticket 
 67 
 confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction? 
 i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8. whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any problems...bombs away.

 Dave: Can you do the same printout today of children for product #33076 Thanks John 
 any reaction to this? 
 i dont know   sounds good to me 
 i loved them in that i thought they were going to go up...i think they still might  3 weeks ago  now short term very bullish  neutral medium term neutral   neutral longer term neutral   bearish 
 What it's trading  what I think it's really worth apr oct   540    500 nov mar 547    375 cal 2  491    400 cal 3   460    325  Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power, williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500 or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years. 
 theres only one thing i can think of...   storage field turning around gives cash market completely different feel.   instead of utilities looking to sell gas everday, they look to buy it.  huge difference in feel of mrket.  not so much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets priced.  tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures... hence the tendency for a spring rally every year.  read heffner today...even he talks about it 
 no real bias today  positive numbers sell negative numbers buy... looking into other stuff 
 Hard to believe , huh 
 I ordered 3 different things...I thought your "wine inventory listings are updated DAILY" ??? 
 Not impressive 
 thanks 
 yes...please change griffith to trading. thanks, john 
 probably because jeff's out,, but let's go ahead and have it 
 dinner or drinks tonight? 
 So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level. With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying. Leads to more upside potential in short term. My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points. i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside.  Thoughts? 
 so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing... as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build the stack now to estimate. frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 100,000 last week as gas got to parity. let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts. bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really inactive. to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense. however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other. notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday? in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand. market needs to see some big stg numbers first. i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads. Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last year's early weather, bombs away. 
 Are you around next Tuesday? 
 I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high. That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.  94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81 4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??  Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three weeks by 15 bcf. Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for J.   Just sell vol. 
 are you free at 3:00 today to go over the aga model? 
 i think this is the biggest chopfest in nat gas history.  scale up seller, scale down buyer. reviewing my aga model and assumptions later today.  i'll see if i have any new inspirations. 
 ok. i would not describe him as the hardest working man in the energy business. 
 it just wasn't the same without you.   how was el doritos? 
 maybe cal 2. 
 freak show. cash started -7 then to -15 then -7 ended -15. 
 freak show.   started at -7.  went to -15 then -7 then finishing out -15 
 industrial demand the scary thing.  no question there are some steel mills and auto factories and plastics plants that were on last november that arent coming up now and its not due to gas prices.  the economy sucks and it will affect ind demand. 
 94 
 Ina: Can you get this paid on a rush basis? thanks,john 
 but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if you can answer that. 
 Forgot, I'm leaving town tomorrow afternoon.  Will be back Thursday morn. We'll do it some other time. 
 Good to hear from you. After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest. i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now. Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go. 
 Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate stack manager.  I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so people don't try to click numbers that are old.  On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message?  Still a very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me.  Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma?  Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk. 
 very interesting.... i've been looking for new activities.  maybe i was born to be a knight 
 true 
 i'm free all week right now. prefer early in the week 
 How about drinks at 5:30 on Thursday.   I try not to interrupt work with personal business. 
 Who cares?????? 
 He just rescheduled to Wednesday.   How about dinner on Wednesday after that ? 
 not really...  already have plans on thursday .  are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday? 
 Just a reminder about drinks Monday night.. 
 my polling location is the knights of columbus hall.  what exactly is a knight of columbus? 
 yes i did 
 Appreciate the opportunity to listen in.  I was unable to view the slide show though.  Can you either email or mail it to me. Thanks, John 
 Michael: Thanks for putting the paperwork together.  I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.  John 
 Kim: 2 tix for Rent this Sat night will be waiting for you at will call at the theatre.  Bring ID. If you have any problems call the ticket agency at 212 302 1643 or me at 713 557 3330. Have fun, John 
 i'll call 
 Monday it is 
 Are you free for drinks either Monday or Wednesday? 
 that's not nice 
 I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a while.  I like it eventually. 
 where's the site that i can sell my vote? 
 Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you.  One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.  I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders. John 
 Thank you. 
 Michael: Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium. I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look into that for me. John. 
 Looks good except for settlement period.  Industry standard and for ease to Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades.  Therefore, there will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction. The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been set.  Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg has been set. John    Enron North America Corp. 
 We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will continue to be a subjective process. 
 We will open EOL 4-7 on Monday for everyone's trading pleasure. 
 both.   i have it on dutch's machine just in case something ever pops up but it rarely does 
 Andy: Can you remove ICE from mine and Mike Maggi's computer. Also, do we have a list of who has it installed.  I hate supporting our competition. John 
 I would do that.  I tried calling but got your voicemail.  Try me at 713 853 3230 
 i didn't say you couldnt come down.   just not to expect much 
 Ina: Can you get a small drink refrigerator for the office stocked with: Water (lots) Diet Coke Coke Dr. Pepper Diet Pepsi Various Fruit Drinks  Thanks, John 
 Please change as indicated 
 Will change 
 i'll check 
 Yesterday, Aquilla sold March at 5.77 and 5.76 for HeHub.  Please change it to Nymex 
 it's one of those theoretically great trades, but those don't always work. Still, I'll put it on and win 7 times out of 10.  just so hard for the market to rally the backwardation is so weak. can easily see h going under if no weather appears. 
 i am free for drinks after work but have dinner plans 
 the end of the season is typically the best month to hold. Even if the first part of the summer is weak, people will be hesistant to sell the back half. Same with the winter.  That's why I'm long H2.  It has good correlation with the front on up moves and tends to hold value on the down move. 
 careful...i'm having another bad day 
 Liz: I have 4 tickets for Destiny's child for you.  They're pretty good seats. I'll put these on hold while I still try to get a box... John 
 Cast John Arnold Bill Perkins Dean Theriot (trainer)  Dean: What's your favorite restaurant? John: Why, are you trying to make Valentine's Day plans? Dean : No.  I'm ready.  I've already bought a Valentine's card. Bill : John's ready too.  He already has his Valentine's hickey. 
 Ina: Can you change my meeting with Sheriff's boys to Tueday after 3:00 from Monday. Also, stick me on thedistribution for the Enron press pack that has all the articles in which Enron is mentioned. Thanks 
 can you send it through lavo.  he's suppose to pay for it. thanks, john 
 imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free saturday day and night? 
 yea 
 can you change #23 and #375 to Nymex 
 can you change deal 27 (paribas) today to NYMEX from gas daily 
 hey hon: had a great time last night.  you're one ok chick. john 
 Don't even think you're getting out of this with the "for a while" crap. Just for that you can add a star to the place we're going. 
 i think taking a cab is more convenient assuming we can find one on the way back. 
 i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded.  Problem is summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly. it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break if we're going to run and i don't see that happening. 
 cute girlfriends....    I'm in 
 cute girlfriends....   I'm in 
 we need one more good shot of cool air to ensure complete and utter chaos for the next 10 months.  hopefully this is it. you gotta love heffner...'if we take out the jan 31 low there is NO WAY anything bullish can happen' 
 split connect 
 you fucker that's my trade.   i was trying to buy nines the last 20 minutes. all i got was scraps.  50-100.  i think it's a great trade. 
 this is the move i was talking about.   v/x implicitly trading 5.5 right now because cal 2 is weak.  some sell side deal got done there but jv is strong 
 just sold 500 q/u at .05      that was the pop i'm looking for 
 you will have 4 tix.  make your plans 
 yea, i'll talk to them.  who should i call? 
 but what's a pig? 
 i think you're absolutely right about q/u.  again just a question of when to put it on.  Seems as if I'm always on the offer of that spread.  yesterday i had a 4.5 offer all day and i think i got 50 or so.  i can almost leg it better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread. i would like to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 2, on any rally that could happen.  was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday? 
 ok. 
 remove from email list 
 don't care about the front.  i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze like we saw on thruday and friday.  trade is getting short in here with cash such a piece.  if weather ever changes, which the weather boys are saying it might in 2 weeks, the cash players are going to be big buyers.  don't really want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though. Backs are crazy stong.  cal 3 traded as high as +10.  everybody a buyer as california trying to buy any fixed price energy they can find 
 he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.  so many technicians bullshit  their way "support at 5400-5600 but if it breaks that look for 5250".  if every technician put specific trades on a sheet with entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of people would be unemployed. 
 will do 
 probably not. it would have to have a lot of upside.  never hurts to listen though 
 The el orbits, eh? i've heard of them but don't remember who they are. there is a chance i've seen them at satellite i guess.  my, you are nosey.  i have a little date tonight.  wanna come along?

 no... i went with matt thurell from koch.  they've got some corporate townhouse out there.  very nice.  good to see the old days of waste aren't completely gone yet. 
 i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though. 
 quit pressuring them    i want to sell some too.  actually sold a few at 9 on the close 
 agree guys are short h/j.  hard to see a big move with cash/futures trading flat.  agree that it has some squeeze potential though.  Started moving today as, simultaneously, march started running up and j aron won a big customer deal.  customer, maybe a hedge fund, bot 1000+ jv 450 puts.  weather frustrating me too.  a little long but it's in the backs so I haven't been hurt.  Sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start going crazy again.  Seen liquids processing come back on at these levels. Would guess more than 50% has from peak.  Industrial demand different story. industrial economy just so weak that many petchems and others are burning less because of their markets, not fuel costs.  Chrystler is a prime example.   Any switching back to gas from industrial or switching back to domestic production from overseas muted by weak economy. 
 we have 4    do you want them? 
 i got 2 for tomorrow. 
 i will try to get tomorrow.  if not, is another day okay? 
 Contact Andy Rowe at 713 966 2107. They are a medium term fundamental energy player.  They have never indicated any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily, but that may change.  They have interest in trading on EOL but have not gotten approval yet.

 Hey: Sorry I've taken a few days to respond.  Just the more I think about it, the worse of an idea it seems for both of us.  There is nothing good that can come of it either professionally or personally.  I still regard you as a good friend.  Nothing has changed that nor do I think we need to act weird around each other going forward.  Something I think we both wanted to try and we did.  Maybe best left there though. John 
 fine 
 Tom: My assistant spoke to Judy Smith about myself and my partner grabbing an extra seat on the jet to Tampa.  My partner and I were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from New York that I do business with.  Unfortunately, since I run the nat gas derivatives desk and February expiration is next Monday, the only way we could go is if the jet were coming back Sunday night.  No commercial flights would get us back in time.  Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me if the plane were leaving after the game.  Please advise, John

 speed on eol message for monday how to move to algorithms dave or tom moran 
 i don't ask...i think he think he'll jinx it if he talks about it. 
 i said i'm a vp and run natural gas derivatives trading and she asked if she could eliminate derivatives because then she'd have to write two more sentences about what that was. 
 a couple of observations from here: cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again. this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy. probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in back support for a while. front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less downside.  doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected. will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever. agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front virtually unchanged.  don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas. now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel production increase hit the market.  just buy vol. 
 Glad to hear progress is being made. I went to Vandy but a little later... 1992-5.

 Can you put a notice on EOL that due to MLK day, we will be closed Sunday and be offering Nymex products only from 4-7 on Monday. Thanks, John 
 next Thursday at 7:00 pm 
 Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal. Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal. 
 sorry i've taken so long...just been trying to fend off the chicks.   life is sooooo hard sometimes.    MONKEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Bubbie: You are hereby invited to the tenth annual Spectron/Enron Celebrity Tony's dinner featuring Brian Tracy, John Arnold, and Mike Maggi.   Regrets only,   John 
 please schedule a round of interviews with john griffith with scott, hunter, phillip, and tom asap (today if possible). thx 
 what's this about? 
 John: I would like for you to come talk to a couple more people on the gas floor about a possible position down the road.  My assistant Ina Rangle is going to schedule a couple interviews.  Please coordinate with her. John 
 I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone. Thanks for your help, John 
 greg: what is the (correct) formula you devised for profitability on last trade is mid? 
 glad you enjoyed yourself even though you didnt get to go to ny.   maybe next year.  Had a great time in new orleans but it was freezing.  nice to get away.  going to vegas this weekend to watch the football games. love you, john 
 are you free for a drink/dinner Wednesday night? 
 Ed: I am starting options on EOL in about two weeks.  As we discussed earlier, I don't have the appropriate manpower to run this in certain circumstances, such as when I'm out of the office.  As such, I'd like to bring in John Griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with your permission. John

 yep 
 duke8duke 
 sorry didnt respond to your message.   don't know how to do that instant messenger thing anymore.  volume very, very light.  most of stated volume in spreads and TAS.  No one seems to want to be in the office this week. Everyone wants to get this year over with. Keep pumping in the fundamental info.   very good stuff and i'm not getting it anywhere else. 
 asshole 
 asshole 
 the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have. good holidays, john 
 i know 
 Any idea what amount of switching in gas equivalents does the implied demand of resid equate to? 
 thx 
 can you program my steno in the offices like the ones on my desk? 
 Thanks...It just seems like all the time. 
 Andy: I just spoke to a guy named Neil Hanover.  He is a fund trader for a company in London.  He asked the head EOL marketer to give him a call about setting him up on the system.  Can you help? his number is 011 44 207 397 0840  john

 you just might never get it back 
 No, i thought you would have known.  don't tell shank i told you.    Jennifer Burns  10/22/2000 07:24 PM 
 hey: what was the first cd we listened to on Wednesday at my place? john 
 still have not received credit for funds wired 11/16.  Please advise. 
 absolutely agree.  the thought is always, even if cash is piece of shit today...wait until the future.  here's my question: what is the environment whereby f/g is worth $.50.   is there a market scenario where this happens? 
 i heard he's interviewing to be Shankman's right hand man    Jennifer Burns  10/20/2000 02:12 PM 
 Andy: I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would be appreciated. John 
 Adam: Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.  Write me about how your interviews went. Good luck: John
