just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.  I'll give you a birthday call later. Robin 
 Kathy,  I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position. Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are not shown on this report.  Brian,  I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report containing December 12th basis positions.  Thank you for your help. Robin

 Jack,   Here is the file for November.  If you have any questions give me a call.    Robin x57478 
 I'll tell you later.  When we're not at work (that should give you a pretty good hint). 
 I can't imagine what she'd be doing with him.  Maybe we are going to acquire a company with a decent analyst program!!  R 
 I had to look for something in my sent mail earlier.  At least half, if not more, of the emails I send are to you!! 
 I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.  Robin

 Bon chance en francais! 
 No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible. They just keep saying the same things over and over.  What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later. 
 No not the HR Spy.  I was in the middle of emailing you when Jennifer walked up to chit chat.  I didn't even think about it and left my email up the whole time she was here.  But I went back and read it and I hadn't written anything incriminating yet.  Talk to ya later.  How was Spanish? 
 Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy outside now.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd starting chanting "Sit down, Pat!"  Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip. 
 So is that a yes now or is it still a no? 
 Congrats on finally accomplishing something.  Have got some good gossip, but I almost got busted a minute ago so you're gonna have to wait!!  Robin 
 Brian/Kathy,  I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points. Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Robin

 I'm here.  My phone's not working(no signal in the woods), but I'll call you when I go to Ruston tomorrow afternoon.  Have a good weekend.  Robin 
 Here's an example of the GRMS spreadsheet. 
 Are you kidding me?????  I'll be 2008 before we know who won this election!!! 
 If we'd known that we could have stayed longer and had a few drinks.  I haven't accomplished anything since I've been back so it wouldn't have mattered to me. 
 What's going on? 
 Did you get caught sneaking in late?  I didn't.  I don't think anyone knew I was gone. 
 Here you go.  This is the P&L we reported as of 3/2/01.  Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
 Kathy,  I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for December.  Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.     Thanks, Robin 
 Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!!  Later, Robin 
 What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river.  I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday. I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm there of course.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 I have to clean out my inbox every few minutes so someone doesn't see my email pop and see all the emails from you!!  Our "privacy" is definitely not going to last long. 
 I think this is a good chance to get back on our Monday schedule.  Not that I don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I could go to lunch.  Robin 
 You're so sweet.  You're making me miss you already. 
 I definitely have time.  Give me a call when you want to go. 
 How's everything going?  Did you finish on time? 
 Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance.  Robin 
 No Problem! 
 Hope everything's okay today.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent Gossett he kept saying summarize "his" accomplishments, and "his" strengths, etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.  I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.  RR 
 What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start until 8:45 right?  Bye, Robin 
 How do you come up with all this?  Did someone teach you how to write accomplishments?  This is awesome.  I hadn't thought about integrating my goals into my accomplishments.  And you consider me an overachiever!!  Thanks. 
 Please remove me from your distribution list as I have moved to a new group.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here's the list.  John Lavorato Louise Kitchen Jeffrey Gossett David Baumbach Frank Hayden Hunter Shively Scott Neal John Arnold Tom Martin Phillip Allen Mike Grigsby Binh Pham Bradley Jones Bilal Bajwa Robin Rodrigue  Binh Pham or Bilal Bajwa will be the people publishing the report.    Enron North America Corp. 
 How did you start your accomplishments?  About the only thing I'm coming up with is "Once upon a time I didn't work in risk and I had a life."  There's probably a better way to do it though. 
 Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange. Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.  See you at lunch. Robin

 Tom,  I would like to attend.  Thank you, Robin 
 Of course I remember.  I have a great Spanish teacher.   I'm RSVPing as soon as I send this so I'll see you tomorrow at lunch if not before.  Robin 
 Dawn,  I can't believe it...I just saw Phillip Allen laugh!!!  Like laugh out loud! Shocking isn't it?  I don't know what caused this phenomenon but I thought you'd like to know about it.  Later, Robin 
 Hey,  Do you want to go to the brown bag tomorrow?  RR 
 Gwen,  My new address is:  958 W. Cuyler Apt 1S Chicago, IL  60613  Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thanks, Robin 
 Te quiero tambien. 
 Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last crack b/c if I didn't you would have!  Robin 
 I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the "secret" lasts. Was she mad at you?  Talk to ya later, Robin

 You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get out of here I'm ready to go.  So go home and watch a couple of movies and then I should be ready to go. 
 What you talkin' bout Willis?  Actually I just got back about 3.  I went home and took a little nap!!  It was awesome.  But to answer your question yeah I'm ready to go.  I probably shouldn't leave, but I'm definitely ready!!! 
 You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it should be a nice 20 hour day today.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  Enjoy a doughnut for me. Robin

 It's been how long...all of maybe a day since you picked on me.  Besides you have the whole weekend to look forward to. 
 Hey Girlie,  Well, it's official.  I'm moving to Chicago.  This is my last week in Houston.  I start work up there on March 12th.  If your free for lunch sometime this week let me know.  Robin 
 Unfortunately I'm afraid that your last estimate is probably the most realistic.  Today is my favorite day of the month...we're rolling everything today!!!  Let me  rephrase that I'M rolling everything tonight.  Maybe that way I won't have to reroll it in the morning!! 
 You mean I'm not half-way yet???!!  I was planning to go home about 11.  You didn't expect me to be awake in Spanish did you?

 Debbie,  Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.  I already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module. Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to submit to ensure I get the proper access.

 My morning was great...no problems, everything nice and quiet the way I like it.  But this afternoon has been a little hectic.  Oh, well, it's making time go much faster.  Well except for the meeting with disable...that dragged on and on.  I'm so excited about getting out of here at a decent time.  If people will quit asking me questions so I can finish changing formulas on the basis report I'm going to get out of here by 3...that's my goal anyway.

 I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me nuts.
