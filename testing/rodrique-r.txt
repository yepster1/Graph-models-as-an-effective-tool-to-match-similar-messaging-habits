 I still haven't caught her.  Supposedly her meetings end at 5, so if I don't get her then I'm leaving.  Have fun at dinner and don't stay too long when you come back.  Bye.

 I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her.  Talk to ya later. 
 When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have nothing else to do I might as well go. 
 Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar?  We got an email saying we were required to attend one of the sessions.  So that's what I'm doing this afternoon.   Yippee! 
 About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that you blew him off.  R 
 I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here. 
 Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers that.  I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good.  Do you have lunch plans? 
 I hate Canada. 
 What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  Hope you're having a good day. Robin

 I'm leaving.  I'll see you Monday.  Hope you have a good weekend.  Te quiero. Robin 
 She does seem pretty impressed that she's effectively the first person we've told.  I think she feels priviledged. 
 I don't think she thinks we kept it a secret very well.  She also didn't think 2 and a half months was very long. 
 Brian,  We have someone new doing the P&L now.  Please include him on all emails. His name is Bradley Jones.  His extension is 713-345-8960.  Thanks, Robin 
 Apparently she thought Valentines was like a first date.  Now she knows we've been dating since December. 
 Binh Knows...she quizzed me as soon as I sat down. 
 Jeff said if we were going to spend that much we should go to the Carribean, so I'm going to research that further.  Let me know if you have any destination suggestions.  RR 
 Hey,  Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke. Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information.  Talk to ya later, Robin  PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch? 
 I'm just glad you sent it to the right person. 
 Apparently you can't open the link so here's a print screen of the website. 
 Susan,  I'm trying to schedule a time and place for our farewell Happy Hour.  Let me know if this works for you.  http://www.qixo.com/Details.html?uRsltID=LF00  Robin

 I usually am right.  Stop laughing!! 
 Why would they want me at that meeting? 
 Does Mariner sound familiar? 
 Maybe if you had done more to relieve my boredom yesterday I would have been more willing to drive you back downtown.  I'm glad you made it back somewhat safely.  Later RR 
 Hey Lynn,  Thanks for checking up.  Laura and I spoke Tuesday.  She was going to contact HR and get back to me.  That's the last I've heard.  Robin 
 Nancy,  I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.  BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST  IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently used region code.)  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help, Robin 
 So you really were working on something and not just making up stories so I'd think you had a job!!  Authur Andersen has everyone checking up on a certain Enron subsidiary you might have some interest in.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon. If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon. That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when I hear something.  RR 
 Sounds good. 
 I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs.  I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm.  Bye RR 
 There's no need to lie.  If you don't have anything interesting to tell me just admit it.  I'm bored not dillusional. 
 Hey Bags,  It's good to hear from you.  I wish I could make it, but I'm going home for the weekend.  Hope you guys have fun.  Bye, Robin 
 That does not qualify as something interesting.  You need to try harder. 
 Tell me something interesting...I'm bored. 
 Hey,  I haven't eaten yet either.  Give me a call and we can decide where to meet. 
 How's your day going?  Mine's actually been extremely boring!  If only I could have had this kind of day yesterday I could have actually done my GMAT homework...oh well. 
 Nancy,  The OPTIONS-EXOTIC-PRC book should not have EXCELSHEETS as the database id. This post id is calced and officialized in ERMS.  The book administrator informed me that this post id contains only option premiums and does not contain positions.  Hope that answers your questions. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today? So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been nice to chew someone out.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Happy Valentine's Day to you too!  And I'm not antiromantic...I'm just not as romantic as some people.  It could be worse.  I could be like my mom...she's less romantic than me.  Tambien te quiero MUcho.

 What was she sentenced for? 
 It really makes me think something's up since he's this organized... 
 Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better. I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today.  Hope your day gets better. Robin 
 Burton,  The book INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  is in the AGG-GASlI portfolio, not in the AGG-GAS III and IV portfolios.  Please add this book to both the AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Thanks, Robin 
 Strong Drugs!!! 
 We saw an even better one the other day.  Someone was trying to sell a 1972 Calladic Hurse.  It's white with orange flames on the front fenders!!!  And it has a huge stereo system in the back.  Now what kind of freak owns something like that and why would you announce it at work? 
 Thanks.  You're the best.  Robin 
 Hey Lynn,  Is Laura back in the office?  I was hoping we could start working with HR early this week, so there would be a possibility that we would have a decision made by the end of the week.  Thanks, Robin

 Are you going to be able to leave anytime soon?  If you are I'll give you a ride.  Let me know. 
 Nancy,  The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.

 Well I'm not exactly busy, but I do have a couple of things I could do. Could you do 4:30 or is that too early? 
 What did she say? 
 What's going on?  Are you busy?  I'm going to try to get out of here early again today.  If there's any chance you can get away by 5 let me know and I'll hang out.  RR 
 Stacey,  I have a couple of questions for you to ensure that we report the positions correctly.  First, is this a Power East or Power West book?  Second, when can we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader for this book?  Thanks for your help. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey girl,  I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave without saying goodbye.  We'll have to get together for lunch once I have some definite plans.  Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off. Robin 
 Tom,  It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected.  Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
 Huh? 
 Here's the extent of what I know about Chicago. 
 Thanks for the update.  Robin 
 Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.   Let me know if you change your mind. Robin 
 You need to quit smokin' crack!!! 
 That was too weird...great minds think alike I guess.  I think our emails must have crossed in the server. 
 Irena,  Someone delivered an envelope for you.  I put it in your top right desk drawer.  Robin 
 Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's really scary.  Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.  I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be specific!!  Robin 
 The FT-NEAST-WH books were set up in the Agg-Gas II portfolio, but never added to the AGG-GAS III or AGG-GAS IV portfolios.  Please add these books under the J_Mrha porfolio in AGG-GAS III and AGG-GAS IV.  Thanks, Robin

 Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman. Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only going to get worse!!

 I'm going home...can you believe it?  Give me a call when you get out of here.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Not yet.  But I haven't given up yet. 
 I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  Now get back to work!! 
 Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a hotel I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, Robin 
 Frank,  I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once Feb rolles to intramonth the "From date" on the calc is changed from the Jan 1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR calc not the post ids.  Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a while.  Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.  Te quiero. Robin

 That was funny...in fact it was the funniest thing I've heard all morning.  I'd rather go to lunch. Thanks anyway though. 
 I have nothing to do either but I'm just surfing the web.  I'm not as dedicated as you are. 
 Hey,  It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  Enough whining for now.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Wei,  I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.

 You are one sick puppy!!  I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges. Let me know when you get them back and we'll go to lunch. 
 Yeah, give me a call.  I'm headed home to do GMAT homework. 
 Yeah, I heard.  It took an act of Congress and I'm not exactly thrilled. I'll tell you all about it later.  Do you have French tonight? 
 I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should have the "offer" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in the mood for it!!  I'll let you know what I find out. Robin 
 You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing is that Emily finally finished high school.  I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly. I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find something out.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Hey,  I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Lynn,  Have you heard anything from HR?  Is there any hope of me knowing something today?  Thanks, Robin 
 Good b/c I didn't really feel like going anyway. 
 I'm surprised you invited me to the class!! 
 If you wanted to see me for lunch you should have just said so.  There's no need of going to the extreme of having a Spanish class...people are going to get suspicious.  RR

 I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows.  They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup. Actually, I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's her last day.  I would invite you but then you'd just be disappointed when we left without you.  Talk to ya later, Robin  Ps  Your boss actually has a reason to be stressed today!!  I wouldn't want to be in that meeting.

 Hey,  Several of us are going to lunch today.  It's kind of a combination birthday party and going away party for Crystal.  Oops I shouldn't have told you she's coming...just kidding.  You're invited if you want to come.  But I understand if you are too busy today to take a long lunch.  Let me know if you want to come.  Robin

 Lynn,  I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the necessary arrangements.  Thank you for your help, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Here is the file that Kori prepared Friday.  Let me know if you need anything else. Robin 
 Any hope yet? 
 Hey Becky,  Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your knee doing by the way.  I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong. And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's actually going to happen.  You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview, much less to live up there.  Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  Robin 
 I'm in no hurry. 
 What's he doing now?  Let me know when you can get away for a second and we'll go buy stamps.  I just surfing the web to see what I can find out about Chicago, so my schedule's pretty flexible. 
 So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let me know if you want anything from downstairs.  No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually.  Are you still planning to go work out at lunch?  Hope everything gets better. Robin 
 I told Gabriel about your hairdryer story.  He was appropriately disgusted. I'm writing procedures for what I do...ya wanna come help me?

 Harry,  A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday. Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.  Robin 
 Are you sure about that email address???  I sent one and it bounced...or was that just another test?

Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while.  Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.

 It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 You sound chipper anyway.   I'm actually bored today.  We haven't had any problems today.  I'm not used to that so I really know what to do with my time.  That and it's Friday and I don't really want to do anything. 
 How did you get back to your desk that fast? 
 How's you day going?  Mine's much better.  Haven't heard from Canada all day.  Did you come in early today? 
 EFF_DT PORTFOLIO_ID DOWN95 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-COAL 2,542. 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-CRD 28,844. 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-GAS 1,094,625. 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-PWR 131,193. 1/11/01  AGG-MANAGEMENT 1,202,894. 
 As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was "They'll listen to Sally."  Hehehe.  We'll see, but I'm not convinced that Canada will listen to anyone. 
 So what's the verdict? 
 Kathy,  The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.  Robin 
 Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."  And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian p&l and for the originations total.  Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.  I'll whine more later, Robin 
 I can drive.  So what ever you want.  I was thinking Churassco's, but I'm definitely open to suggestions. 
 Shifali,  Please see the attached email.  If anyone else in your group grants Middle Market Nymex Originations please forward them this email.  Thank you, Robin x57478

 You crack me up...I think I only know one person who has worse luck at work than you do, and that would be my EMT friend that broke someone's glass eye. I can't believe your boss is making you work on Monday...even we don't have to work Monday.  I'll talk to ya later, Robin 
 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.  Robin 
 Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.    Enron North America Corp. 
 That's fine.  Just let me know when you want to go.  But give me a few minutes, we're working on something.  It shouldn't take but about 10 minutes. 
 Hey,  How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?  Bye. Robin 
 Beginning this week an Origination report will be given to Fred Lagrasta each morning.  The information for this report is taken from the Origination schedule tab of your P&L file.

There is also additional information that is now required for all Middle Market Nymex Originations.

 How funny is that that I was emailing you at exactly the same time you were emailing me! 
 Hey,  What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring. Anything interesting in your world?  It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.

 I'm gonna have to kill Rock.  He managed to screw up 3 days worth of Basis Reports on Friday!!  How I have no idea.  I had already rolled everything.  All he had to do was query and calc it.  Go figure.  Robin 
 Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you can stop by and visit.  RR 
 I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my brother's cd.

 That would be such a shame if you couldn't go.  You might just have to come with me again.  Just don't go and not be able to come back. 
 What website did you find that cruise on? 
 Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off. I'll just have to stay here all by myself.  If we go to lunch today, it'll have to be kind of quick.  I have my meeting with the analyst people at 11:30 and another meeting at 1:00.  Bye. RR 
 Ohhhhh.  You have a real problem sending messages to the wrong people, don't you? 
 I dropped it off on my way this morning.   It's really no big deal to drive across the street on my way in. 
 No I mean are you awake or are you just sleeping at your desk.  By the way, thanks for taking the movie back last night. 
 Are you awake?

 Are you just hanging around waiting on me? 
 I can't believe you aren't going to be here for New Year's Eve!!! 
 And I thought you were a nice guy!!  Boy was I wrong! 
 Sorry for kind of cutting you off earlier, but Gossett was hoovering.  It's not exactly career enhancing to make your boss wait.  I'll call you later, Robin 
 What???  I'm confused. 
 What  you talking about, Willis?  I thought you were in Chicago.  Last I heard it was a little bigger than most college campuses.  For sure bigger than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes the day pass much faster.  Good night. Robin 
 Any last words for your car before I leave for my nap??  Don't worry I'm a "safe driver."  I'll sleep a little extra for you.  How's everything going this morning? 
 Hey Becky,  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be running marathons by now.  I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.  Robin

 Accounting Magic.  Am I good or what? 
 Yeah, give me about 10 minutes. 
 You better decide soon.  I'm only waiting on Canada. 
 Read what Kathy wrote...What am I supposed to go tell Lavo he's wrong!!  I know she's the best risk person we have, but give me a break! 
 I'm low on clean clothes...I need to think if I have something to wear! 
 Try this one.    Thanks, Robin 
 Here's the file from Jeff. 
 So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else. 
 I wasn't worried about you making it.  I was worrried about you making it back in time to give me my presents.  I work with a guy in our Chicago office.  He said it was pretty bad there.  I told him you were headed up there and he said he hoped you didn't mind delays.  Glad you made it safely.  You know you can buy disposable cameras at most stores.  Try to stay warm. Robin 
 I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch. If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up for whatever you want to do (within reason that is).  Gotta go Canada's calling. Robin 
 I'm headed to become a "safe driver."  Robin 
 I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's just no pleasing some people.  I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH. Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.  I'll give you a birthday call later. Robin 
 Kathy,  I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position. Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are not shown on this report.  Brian,  I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report containing December 12th basis positions.  Thank you for your help. Robin

 I had to look for something in my sent mail earlier.  At least half, if not more, of the emails I send are to you!! 
 I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!

 Bon chance en francais! 
 No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible. They just keep saying the same things over and over.  What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later. 
 No not the HR Spy.  I was in the middle of emailing you when Jennifer walked up to chit chat.  I didn't even think about it and left my email up the whole time she was here.  But I went back and read it and I hadn't written anything incriminating yet.  Talk to ya later.  How was Spanish? 
 Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy outside now.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd starting chanting "Sit down, Pat!"  Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip. 
 So is that a yes now or is it still a no? 
 Congrats on finally accomplishing something.  Have got some good gossip, but I almost got busted a minute ago so you're gonna have to wait!!  Robin 
 Brian/Kathy,  I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points. Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Robin

 Here's an example of the GRMS spreadsheet. 
 Are you kidding me?????  I'll be 2008 before we know who won this election!!! 
 If we'd known that we could have stayed longer and had a few drinks.  I haven't accomplished anything since I've been back so it wouldn't have mattered to me. 
 What's going on? 
 Did you get caught sneaking in late?  I didn't.  I don't think anyone knew I was gone. 
 Here you go.  This is the P&L we reported as of 3/2/01.  Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
 Kathy,  I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for December.  Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.     Thanks, Robin 
 Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!!  Later, Robin 
 What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river.  I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday. I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm there of course.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 I have to clean out my inbox every few minutes so someone doesn't see my email pop and see all the emails from you!!  Our "privacy" is definitely not going to last long. 
 I think this is a good chance to get back on our Monday schedule.  Not that I don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I could go to lunch.  Robin 
 You're so sweet.  You're making me miss you already. 
 I definitely have time.  Give me a call when you want to go. 
 How's everything going?  Did you finish on time? 
 Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance.  Robin 
 No Problem! 
 Hope everything's okay today.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent Gossett he kept saying summarize "his" accomplishments, and "his" strengths, etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.  I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.  RR 
 What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start until 8:45 right?  Bye, Robin 
 How do you come up with all this?  Did someone teach you how to write accomplishments?  This is awesome.  I hadn't thought about integrating my goals into my accomplishments.  And you consider me an overachiever!!  Thanks.

Enron North America Corp. 
 How did you start your accomplishments?  About the only thing I'm coming up with is "Once upon a time I didn't work in risk and I had a life."  There's probably a better way to do it though. 
 Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange. Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.  See you at lunch. Robin

 Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last crack b/c if I didn't you would have!  Robin 
 I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the "secret" lasts. Was she mad at you?  Talk to ya later, Robin

 You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get out of here I'm ready to go.  So go home and watch a couple of movies and then I should be ready to go. 
 What you talkin' bout Willis?  Actually I just got back about 3.  I went home and took a little nap!!  It was awesome.  But to answer your question yeah I'm ready to go.  I probably shouldn't leave, but I'm definitely ready!!! 
 You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it should be a nice 20 hour day today.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  Enjoy a doughnut for me. Robin

I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group so I don't have to do anything.  Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?  Bye-bye. Robin

I just had to rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other than that I'm okay.  And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?  Talk to ya later, Robin

 Are you thinking that there's a problem with Canada's position? 
 No Problem.  One question though, why are we taking Enovate out of Agg-gas?

 Debbie,  I would like to have access to the VAR reports in RisktRac.  I am responsible for preparing the Gas Benchmark and the VAR report that is given to ENA management each morning.   Therefore I already have access to the VAR information.  Please let me know what I need to do to be granted this access.  Thank you, Robin x57478

 Kathy/Brian,  As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are spelled correctly in all position files.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks, Robin 
 Will,  Please send me the official book names so that I can set this up in the bench.  If you have a copy of the book request that should have all the information I need.  Also, please let me know what trader is responsible for this position.  Thanks, Robin

 Jeff,  I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.  Talk to you Monday. Robin 
 Don't worry there's no rush.  Take your time and exhaust all your other options...don't worry it doesn't hurt my feelings that you are trying desparately to get out of spending the holidays with me.  Just kidding.  Have a good weekend. Robin 
 Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  What'cha doing for lunch?  Robin

 Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space?? I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me the longest and I'm still not happy with it.  Have fun bowling.  I'd love to see your shirt!! Robin 
 Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your boss yesterday?  Later, Robin

 I'm so impressed.  You mean you actually got to leave the building...wow. Actually you won't believe this but I left the building for lunch.  I just went to Chick-fil-A, but at least it wasn't Enron. 
 Huh??  I'm confused. 
 Sorry it took me so long to reply, we had a slight crisis here.  I went to Shreveport on Nov. 2.  That would be about right for when you left b/c you left me just in time to have to roll the month by myself...just kidding.  RR 
 I couldn't send myself a net send.  Guess I'll just have to talk to myself the old fashioned way. RR 
 I'm not sure specifically what you're refering to...Do you mean someone on the financial book's love life (ie Susan or Kori), or the HR spy?  Glad it worked, now maybe you won't get fired.  Have you gotten something to eat yet?  Robin

 Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the "fun run" on Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.  As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here. I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in seasoning.  I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might see and for fear he'd think I was interested.  Gotta go to a meeting. Robin 
 We're going to try for the conference room next to Bob Hall's office, but if that's taken we'll just meet at Frank's desk. 
 Frank has asked me to let you know that our VAR meeting will be at  9:30a.m. this morning.  Thanks, Robin

 Hey Becky,  What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war. He said, "Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very well so I left."  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people!!  How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's all anyone's talking about around here.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron statue of a tree?  Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch.  Robin

 I'll be there. 
 Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They screwed their position up again today.  My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a message on it that said, "Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you."  Are we having Spanish class today?  Robin  PS My forearms are a little sore, but that's all. 
 Thanks.  How was the rest of your weekend?  RR 
 Yeah, but you know I can't resist an opportunity to make a sarcastic remark. 
 What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do. Thanks for the help with this.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me. Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well. So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a group of top quality American athletes.  Bye.  PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than Gossett. 
 PS.  Tell him I'm definitely interested. 
 Yeah that very interesting.  What exactly is the origination team doing now that they've already signed the deal with blockbuster?  Are they trying to sign up customers or providers or what?  RR 
 I don't think most people would understand the humor, but I thought it was really funny.  Especially after the week I've had!!  RR 
 It works...that's pretty neat by the way!  See ya Friday (It'll be your turn to vent). Robin 
 Let me know if you need anything else.  Robin 
 I didn't want this just popping up on your screen.  So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.  He must think I'm the biggest idiot in the world.  I'm going to have to change my name to get another job after he fires me.  When he saw me standing outside his office this last time he just spread his hands like what could possible be wrong now!!  If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back now's your chance.  I think John would pay you $100,000 to take back over.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 Chris,  Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need any more information.  Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 contracts over the same period.  Robin

When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your dumb butt. When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the porcelain god. When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt. This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end. Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

 Dawn,  Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know.  Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  Hope you enjoyed your trip.  Robin 
 Hey Greg,  I just got you email, but I do want to be in on the gift for Becky.  Count me in for $20.  I'll bring the money down in the morning.  Where are you located now?  Thanks, Robin 
 See you tomorrow. Robin 
 I'm not here...at least my mind anyway.    I take it you aren't too busy today.  We need to plan on going to lunch sometime soon.  My last day is next Thursday.  Yippee!!  This is my last bidweek...Thank goodness. 
 Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day. The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  Bye, Robin  PS If I forget my bras, I'm just not going to bother!! 
 No one would notice if I forgot my bras!!!!  Thanks for the well wishes. I'll take lots of pictures so you can see them.  I can't wait for this week to be over...only one and a half days!!  Robin 
 I no longer need to receive Hyperion updates.  Thank you, Robin 
 Just a reminder I'll be in Derivatives Tues. and Wed.   I'll have my phone with me in case anyone needs anything.  Thanks, Robin 281-300-9145 
 Phillip,  I will be in class Tuesday and Wednesday.  Jeff and Chris will have my number if you need to reach me.    Robin 
 Have a good weekend!  Robin

 I thought of you two when I read this!!!  You are some of the only people who would understand!!  Robin 
 Have a good evening. Robin 
 Okay, here's a trivia question for you.   There are two siblings.  One's an engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting firm?  Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner in New Orleans.  I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the special olympics...then I might stand a chance!  Congrats on the job. Robin 
 I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes. I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know. And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.  We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.  Talk to ya later, RR 
 Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.  What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I enjoy the fact that this is on your company email.  I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I don't think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have two right now.  Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Are you trying to make me blind like you?????  RR 
 I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug them into anything.  I think I'll have them as a decoy in case I end up with an annoying neighbor for the flight.  Everyone around me knows my travel plans as well as I do.  I think I must have become a little annoying myself.  Well back to work.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 What are you doing??  I'm bored.  Did you have a good weekend?  RR 
 You have no idea just how appropriate that is today!!!  Thanks for the laugh!  RR 
 I'll take your Visa.  Just let me know when you've mailed it.    You have a Platinum card, right?  R 
 I actually just did it for my mom...otherwise she wouldn't have gotten a gift at all!! 
 I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my brother's name on the gift.

 How much did you pay for your clubs?  By the way, I thought using company email was a nice touch.  We were named one of the top 100 companies to work for...number 24 to be exact.  They are pushing for #1 next year.   I think it's the Analyst program that's holding them back right now!!!  Well back to pretending to work.  Right now I'm training and there's nothing to do in the middle of the day with this job, so there are two of us trying to stay busy doing nothing right now!  Later, RR 
 You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store). You did a very good job picking it out.  Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them for ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to the driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on this sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the "golf junkies" but I'm not sure you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day thinking "I need that!"  Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Robert,  Here are the machines I've logged on.  1.  The computer to the left of my desk, 3275d.  2.  Both of my machines.  3.  Both of Rock's machines, 3275f.  4.  Gabriel's computer, 3275g.  Thanks, Robin 
 So are you going to enter??? 
 Gabriel,  I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day. However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  Thanks, Robin  PS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd.  I'll be in a little early tomorrow to tie it out for the 24th.  Bye. 
 How scandulous of your mother!!  My mother would never use sucks...but my dad told me something pissed him off one time.  I was completely shocked...I didn't even know what to say.  I know it's hard to imagine me speechless, but I was.  You should know by now that I'm heartless and that my grandmother will have to go the hospital all alone.  I had to listen to her last time whine about how no one respects her.  It took everything I had not to say, "Of course we don't respect you.  We all know you're crazy."  What are you doing for lunch Friday (as in probably the day you're reading this)?  I'm going to come in early b/c I've been bombarded as soon as I walk in the door the last two days.  Let me know if you want to go to lunch.  I'll call you when I get in.  I'll be praying for Megan. Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  It came to our attention yesterday that the PWR-GAS-LT-MGMT-PRC book is included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  This book is officalized by Jenny Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.  Therefore, I don't believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Also please ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Here is the detail and position for IM Canada yesterday.  It seems that the price txt file didn't get run last night (our fault).   I'll make sure that gets done tonight.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course!  Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you know!  RR 
 I will not be able to attend this meeting. 
 Refined Products recognized $30,600 in Originations on their P&L that was not included on their Orig Schedule.  Thanks, Robin 
 I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the bottom.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal carcasses with cancers, tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for human consumption as long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a general loosening of slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends Aug. 29. One critic already weighed in, saying she did not want to "eat pus from a chicken that has pneumonia," but also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, infectious arthritis and diseases caused by intestinal worms.    In Their Own Words  Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his Huge Hooter Haven strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town for the Billy Graham Crusade that weekend: "I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly keep up with preachers. Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never entered my mind that (it was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium."    http://www.msnbc.com/comics/nw.asp 
 Refined Products recognized $6,300 of Originations on their P&L that was not included in the Originations file.  Thanks, Robin 
 I will be attending the dinner.  Thank you, Robin 
 I have not taken any time off this time period.  Thanks, Robin 
 It's a shame you don't know someone who wants to get involved!! 
 Yes, I got it a few minutes after I sent you the email.  Thanks.  Robin 
 Are you still working on the CanadaPower file?? 
 Thanks.  Have a good weekend, and I'm looking forward to the Term book adventure next week.  Robin 
 Tempting, but no thanks...I'm probably more likely to go running at 6am on Sat. than willingly subjecting myself to itchy. 
 Brad,  Here is the book that was set up for John Arnold's crude position.  The attached spreadsheet should contain all the information you need, but should you require additional information please do not hesitate to call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Thanks for making my day by sucking me back into a world with mental images of someone standing there scratching!! 
 A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were lost "in a series of small fires". The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated, nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which  it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that  it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be considered to be an "unacceptable fire," and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he had lost in the "fires". And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine. 
 No prob, bob. 
 The NG Price book granted $1,400 of Middle Market East Originations that was not recognized by the Intra-East book on the NGP&L.  Thanks, Robin 
 Now that was funny!!  RR 
 NOT A CHANCE...I don't even get near the water here!! 
 She's been drinking the water here, hasn't she? 
 You guys should submit an eRequest to get access to all the Gas Reports on the Executive Viewer.  Here's a list of the reports you'll want.  Origination Schedule Natural Gas Prices Natural Gas Basis Positions Natural Gas Profit & Loss by Book Natural Gas Net Fixed Price Positions by Book Natural Gas Basis by Trader  Also, Brad you need to request access to the O:/Bench directory so that you'll be able to save a copy of the NGPL in this directory each night.  Bilal, you'll need access to the O:/Gas_Trad and O:/Bench directories.  Robin 
 There was at least a third of it left, but it's in the trash now.  You're welcome to come get it.  I'm craving the brownies that I know are on my counter at home. 
 I find this joke even funnier coming from an Aggie grad.  Robin 
 The NG Price book granted $500 of Middle Market Central Originations that was not recognized by the Intra-Central book on the NGP&L.  Thanks, Robin 
 That's your FAVORITE joke!  That was a really lame joke...in fact it was pathetic.  Remind me never to take you to an open mike at a comedy club...actually I don't think you'll ever have to remind me! 
 Now I'm scared. 
 Well I feel privileged to be included in your daily entertainment.  RR 
 You must have more fun at your office than we have here...that or you've just lost your mind!!  Robin 
 Here you go.  Robin 
 What kind of twisted diet are you on???   I had a sandwhich.  Nothing too exciting.  Did the potatoes hire anyone?  Later, Robin 
 That's all well and good, but where are my text files???  Just kidding. Robin 
 I would like to change my parking contract from the Clay garage to the Allen Center garage.  Thank you, Robin 
 I would like to change my parking contract from the Clay garage to the Allen Center Garage.  Thank you, Robin 
 No I promise I didn't....your post-id crashed my system.  I had your book and the power book and the Nymex book all coming in at the same time and the system just stopped.  We're going again though, so I should have your position in a few minutes.  RR 
 I would like to attend the Cornell Brown Bag.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Please use the book id FT-CAND-PWR-PRC  and name the file CanadaPower_08022000.  These are the only changes I am having to make each night.  Thanks for your help.  Robin 
 Here you go!  Robin 
 Hey Brian,  I'm having to plug your positions again.  I checked the conversion factors and I have the same ones that you have on the IM Positions tab of your excel file.  Let me know if you have any ideas as to what the problem might be. I'm attaching a copy of the positions that I pulled in and the detail.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.    Thanks, Robin 
 What makes you think I talk to her at all...I just have to listen. 
 Me bored??  I think you must be more bored than me to talk about ear cleaning.  There's this new person that sits down the row from me and she baby talks...what's up with that!  It's so irritating.  Well now that I've gossipped about someone 10ft from me I better send this email before someone walks by and reads it.  I think I'll skip the run this week.  RR 
 You are so picky!!   RR    Enron North America Corp.

 Kenny,  I'm not in accounting any more, so I no longer need this email.  Thanks, Robin 
 I promise I didn't forget about you tonight!  RR 
 Why did you send my message back to me with no reply of your own??? 
 I have not taken any time off.  Thanks, Robin 
 I'm SO Sorry that I forgot about you. 
 Did you get my message about the books? 
 Hopefully the third times a charm!  Robin 
 That was hilarious.  I especially liked the chain saw and the flame thrower!  RR 
 Nancy,  Here's the book request I spoke with you about.   This also needs to be added to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII, AND AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Please include as a separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  Please let me know when this book is set up.  Thanks, Robin 
 It sounds pretty good, but I'd rather talk to mom and see if there's something specific he wants before we get that.  B/c for all his talk about using the computer he usually ends up using his books instead.  I'll call mom either tonight or in the morning.  I'll let you know what I find out.  Robin 
 Hey,  I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny that you wrote that to my from your work email.  Well it's about time I got started working today.  Robin 
 Yeah, like this week.  And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones.  And I can't seem to find my catalog to order mom something.  I requested a new one but I don't know if we'll get it in time.  You need to just go wander around a home depot and find Dad some useless gadget.  Later, Robin 
 Brian,  Well, we're a lot closer, but we're not exact.  I'm attaching a copy of what I pulled when I loaded the new files.     Thanks for your help,  Robin 
 Brian,  Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position. Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve this variance.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how we did.  Robin 
 Brian,  Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all unique what you had was fine.  If you have any more questions just give me a call.    Thanks, Robin 
 Sorry it took so long.  Robin 
 Kathy,  Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.  Thanks, Robin 
 Good luck with your meeting. 
 How is the FT-Exotic file coming?  Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  The INTRA-CNT-TRANS problem was on my end.  It wasn't defined properly in the bench.  Thanks, Robin 
 Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  Did the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book get included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio?  Thanks, Robin 
 Carol,  I have attached the items you requested.  If you need any further information please let me know.  I work in the evenings so if you need anything before 2:00 please call my cell phone.  The number is 281-300-9145.     Thank you for your help,  Robin x57478 
 Here are the FT Positions.  Let me know how they look.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here are the FT Positions including the Exotics.    Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  It seems that the criteria in the GD-NEW-PRC0 portfolio was deleted.  Please add this back so that we can pull positions into the benchmark.  If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Nicole,  This is the position EXCLUDING Exotics.  I haven't been able to load the text file yet.  But I'll send that as soon as I have it.  I also included the detail.  Let me know if I can help.  Robin x57478 
 I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today? I've been "training" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who knew the reports besides me.  I told him it was going to be up to him and Binh to know all the reports.  I told him I wasn't going to leave my new phone number.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 713-345-7478  Thanks, Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  We need to set up a new Intra-Central Physical Book.  INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY  There are already Intra-Cnt-Trans Price, Basis, GD, and IDX books set up. The region code for the physical book should be CENTRLTRSP.  If you have any questions please let me know.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Ramesh,  Here are the Intra-Central books that are pulling the wrong post ids.  Let me know if you need anything else.  BOOK ID   7/7/2000 POSTID  INTRA-CNT-MKT-PHY  773281  INTRA-CNT-MID-PHY  826984  INTRA-CNT-GULF-PHY 483279  INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY 483282  INTRA-CNT-MKT2-PHY 773283  If you have any questions this weekend you can leave me a message at work or call me at home.  My home number is 713-781-0545.  Thanks for your help, Robin x57478 
 Here are your positions including the exotics.  Robin 
 Kathy,  Here are your FT Positions exlcuding the exotics.  Are you going to send me the exotics spreadsheet tonight?    Thanks, Robin 
 Thank you.  Robin 
 Here is the file containing the positions before the exotics file was added, positions including the exotics file and the detail supporting the positions.  If you have any questions give me a call.    Robin 
 Nicole,  These are the FT Canada positions excluding the Exotic text file that Kathy sent.  I'm going to pull it in shortly and then I'll resend you your positions.  Robin 
 Ramesh,  Could you please resend me the email with all your groups pager numbers.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  I just spoke with Gary Stadler and he said the number doesn't really matter for our purposes but it must be unique for the system.  He suggested you just make it a consecutive numbering down the file.  Robin 
 That's just disgusting.  We had PF Chang's.  It was good but it keeps coming back to visit!! Just thought you'd like to know that. 
 Kathy,  I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more guidelines for the text files.  1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)  2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.  3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.  4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a zero.  5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please use a zero.  The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you have any question, please give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel file that Brian saved in the directory.  Thanks, Robin 
 Please format the text files to be processed through GRMS in the following manner.  1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date. 2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97 3) The book names must be the same every day. 4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no value.  GRMS will not recognize a N/A in a field that is supposed to contain a number. 5) Please name the files in a manner consistent with those below.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Is Kathy going to send text files tonight?  Thanks, Robin 
 That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.  Thanks, Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is the New Date Bucket format that we need for your mini-benches for the Benchmark(not the Lavo Bench) for July.  1. July 2. Aug. Index 3. August 4. Sept 5. Oct 6. Nov 7. Dec 8. Jan '01 9.

 Chris,  The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today. However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today. When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here are your positions and I also included the detail.  Let me know!    Thanks, Robin 
 Please set up the following book in the GRMS and in the GRMS Portfolio Heirarchy.  INTRA-CNT-MKT2-PHY  Thanks, Robin 
 Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge $6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him. 
 Here is the detail of yesterday's position.  Let me know if there's anything else you need.    Thanks, Robin x713-345-7478 
 Hey guys,  Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM Canada.  Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve variances before the system is shut down.  Thanks, Robin    PS for future reference my extension is 713-345-7478.

 I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  Well I better get busy.  Bye.  We still need to go to lunch sometime.  RR 
 I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)  GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9  GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3  GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)  If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic please let me know.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Here you go! 
 David,  Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.  4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process must be started over.  7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position.  8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently in the bench.  10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it.  If you have any more questions let me know.  Robin x57478 
 I told you about this Friday...you were probably just not awake enough to remember.  I'm going up there on Friday morning (after the checks) and coming back Sat. afternoon.  If I can get an apartment Friday I'll probably try to fly standby and come back earlier Sat.

 Virendra,  Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that are fixed price gas daily deals.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Here are you positions. 
 Gas prices are so high that when I pulled into a station this morning and asked for a dollar's worth, the attendant dabbed some behind my ears.

 Could you please ensure that these books are set up the same in GRMS as in ERMS.  They have been officialized and are still not pulling the positions in automatically.  I am having to manually override the post-ids.  BOOK NAME    6/21/2000 POST-ID  INTRA-CAND-WEST-PHY  816302  INTRA-ST-COVE-BAS   816594  INTRA-ST-COVE-PRC   816593  Thank you, Robin x57478 
 Hey Guys,  We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you show a position of long 241 contracts.     Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Here are your positions.  Let me know if they're okay.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Tomorrow I'm going to be here really early in the morning, so I'll probably be tired tomorrow night.  But I could go to the concert if you can get tickets.  B/c Thursday I'll have to pack and get some sleep for my flying trip to Chicago Friday.  Bye, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Gary,  Could you please add the books below that are in red to the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Thanks for the info on the INTRA-CND  book.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark. Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a copy of what you reported.  As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.  Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Good luck in your new job.  I've had fun teasing...I mean working with you.  Robin 
 I just got your email, so it'll be a little while.  I'll let you know...that or I'll just leave and not bother to tell you!

 I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she ruined your weekend.

 Why does that not surprise me.  Besides I told you to wait until you were a little more lucid...that should be much longer than a few minutes...more like a few years!! 
 Read what you wrote sometime when your not so tired, and let me know if you understood it....b/c I sure didn't!!  I have no idea what you're trying to say.  So just imagine me nodding my head and smiling politely.  RR 
 1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.  2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to properly represent originations on the NGP&L.  3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.  4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so that the information                need only be queried once.  This was accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.  6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report to the Benchmark.  7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would like to see them also please let me know.  Thanks, Robin

 It's b/c you don't have me there to control things!!  Just kidding.  Sounds like you as busy as we are.   So quit reading your email and get to work!!  RR 
 GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun? Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a father's day gift for my dad.  Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later. RR 
 Take 2.  See if you like this one better.    Robin 
 Here are you positions.  Have a good evening.    Robin 
 Laura,  Here's what I received from the Analyst program.  Robin 
 Wow,  I think this is a record you guys.  Here are you positions.  Let me know how it looks.  I fixed the conversion factor issue we were having so our out months should be closer tonight.    Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go.  Let us know if there are any problems. 
 I told you I had a rough day!!!  I was DYING by the last game.   I've never felt that out of shape.   So what are you still doing here? 
 You must be having a bad day!!  But you know it's not my fault...and there's nothing soft about softball!!  And I slid yesterday, twice, so I have a little bit of a rasberry on my calf.  Did that get me any sympathy?? Probably not!  I hope you finish close soon. 
 I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that's this sore.  We should be sore though.  We played 5 games.  And I played every second of every game.  Now don't you feel sorry for me?! 
 What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it felt like.  Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always asking and driving you crazy.  Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.  RR 
 Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling different factors.  Let me know how the position looks tonight.    Thanks, Robin 
 I'm sure you were excited to see this email.  You get to reroll the whole year...again!!!  Have fun with that entry.  Robin 
 It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at apartments.  Robin 
 I'm going.  Thanks, Robin 
 Ivonne,  Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I turn it in to?  Thanks, Robin    Enron North America Corp.

 Kathy,  I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to remind him at the end of the month.  I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.   Bilal Bajwa x713-853-3409  P&L-  Bradley Jones  x713-345-8960  Positions- Binh Pham x713-853-5791  Thanks, Robin 
 Oh we're going now...I have the tickets. 
 Got 'em.  Let me know when you can get out of here.  I guess we'll have to ride the bus.  I'm not sure.  Unless you want to try to bribe the parking people again. 
 Wanna go to the Rodeo? 
 I sent Charlene an email this morning and surprise, surprise I haven't heard anything.  Not too much going on right now.  Talk to ya later. 
 I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday.  Robin 
 Did you see?  She completely blew me off.  I submitted a more specific question this time. 
 Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring this up as something great they've done to improve communication.  R 
 Are you watching this eSpeak?  Either no one is asking interesting questions or they are censoring them.  I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned PRC reps, but she hasn't answered that yet. 
 My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake. You'll be invited too of course.  I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?  Talk to ya later Robin 
 Hey Richard,  I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  I'll let you know if anything changes.  Robin 
 Kathy,  I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.    Robin

 Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We need to all go to lunch before I leave.  Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR 
 As long as he leaves after me I think it's great!!! 
 Hahaha.  That was pretty funny.  I have a feeling that's the reaction my grandmothers will actually have. 
 I thought you  comments about the "flexibility" of the program were hilarious.  I just talked to Laura.   I'm moving to Chicago.  I'll give you all the details and dates later. 
 Susan,  The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named M_Maggi.  If you have any questions, give me a call. Thanks, Robin

 I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her.  Talk to ya later. 
 When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have nothing else to do I might as well go. 
 Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar?  We got an email saying we were required to attend one of the sessions.  So that's what I'm doing this afternoon.   Yippee! 
 About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that you blew him off.  R 
 I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here. 
 Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers that.  I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good.  Do you have lunch plans? 
 I hate Canada. 
 What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  Hope you're having a good day. Robin

 She does seem pretty impressed that she's effectively the first person we've told.  I think she feels priviledged. 
 I don't think she thinks we kept it a secret very well.  She also didn't think 2 and a half months was very long. 
 Brian,  We have someone new doing the P&L now.  Please include him on all emails. His name is Bradley Jones.  His extension is 713-345-8960.  Thanks, Robin 
 Apparently she thought Valentines was like a first date.  Now she knows we've been dating since December. 
 Binh Knows...she quizzed me as soon as I sat down. 
 Jeff said if we were going to spend that much we should go to the Carribean, so I'm going to research that further.  Let me know if you have any destination suggestions.  RR 
 Hey,  Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke. Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information.  Talk to ya later, Robin  PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch? 
 I'm just glad you sent it to the right person. 
 Apparently you can't open the link so here's a print screen of the website. 
 Susan,  I'm trying to schedule a time and place for our farewell Happy Hour.  Let me know if this works for you.  http://www.qixo.com/Details.html?uRsltID=LF00  Robin

 I usually am right.  Stop laughing!! 
 Why would they want me at that meeting? 
 Does Mariner sound familiar? 
 Maybe if you had done more to relieve my boredom yesterday I would have been more willing to drive you back downtown.  I'm glad you made it back somewhat safely.  Later RR 
 Hey Lynn,  Thanks for checking up.  Laura and I spoke Tuesday.  She was going to contact HR and get back to me.  That's the last I've heard.  Robin 
 Nancy,  I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.  BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST  IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently used region code.)  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help, Robin 
 So you really were working on something and not just making up stories so I'd think you had a job!!  Authur Andersen has everyone checking up on a certain Enron subsidiary you might have some interest in.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon. If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon. That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when I hear something.  RR 
 Sounds good. 
 I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs.  I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm.  Bye RR 
 There's no need to lie.  If you don't have anything interesting to tell me just admit it.  I'm bored not dillusional. 
 Hey Bags,  It's good to hear from you.  I wish I could make it, but I'm going home for the weekend.  Hope you guys have fun.  Bye, Robin 
 That does not qualify as something interesting.  You need to try harder. 
 Tell me something interesting...I'm bored. 
 Hey,  I haven't eaten yet either.  Give me a call and we can decide where to meet. 
 How's your day going?  Mine's actually been extremely boring!  If only I could have had this kind of day yesterday I could have actually done my GMAT homework...oh well. 
 Nancy,  The OPTIONS-EXOTIC-PRC book should not have EXCELSHEETS as the database id. This post id is calced and officialized in ERMS.  The book administrator informed me that this post id contains only option premiums and does not contain positions.  Hope that answers your questions. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today? So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been nice to chew someone out.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Happy Valentine's Day to you too!  And I'm not antiromantic...I'm just not as romantic as some people.  It could be worse.  I could be like my mom...she's less romantic than me.  Tambien te quiero MUcho.

 It really makes me think something's up since he's this organized... 
 Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better. I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today.  Hope your day gets better. Robin 
 Burton,  The book INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  is in the AGG-GASlI portfolio, not in the AGG-GAS III and IV portfolios.  Please add this book to both the AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Thanks, Robin 
 Strong Drugs!!! 
 We saw an even better one the other day.  Someone was trying to sell a 1972 Calladic Hurse.  It's white with orange flames on the front fenders!!!  And it has a huge stereo system in the back.  Now what kind of freak owns something like that and why would you announce it at work? 
 Thanks.  You're the best.  Robin 
 Hey Lynn,  Is Laura back in the office?  I was hoping we could start working with HR early this week, so there would be a possibility that we would have a decision made by the end of the week.  Thanks, Robin

 Nancy,  The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.

 Well I'm not exactly busy, but I do have a couple of things I could do. Could you do 4:30 or is that too early? 
 What did she say? 
 What's going on?  Are you busy?  I'm going to try to get out of here early again today.  If there's any chance you can get away by 5 let me know and I'll hang out.  RR 
 Stacey,  I have a couple of questions for you to ensure that we report the positions correctly.  First, is this a Power East or Power West book?  Second, when can we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader for this book?  Thanks for your help. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey girl,  I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave without saying goodbye.  We'll have to get together for lunch once I have some definite plans.  Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off. Robin 
 Tom,  It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected.  Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
 Huh? 
 Here's the extent of what I know about Chicago. 
 Thanks for the update.  Robin 
 Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.   Let me know if you change your mind. Robin 
 You need to quit smokin' crack!!! 
 That was too weird...great minds think alike I guess.  I think our emails must have crossed in the server. 
 Irena,  Someone delivered an envelope for you.  I put it in your top right desk drawer.  Robin 
 Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's really scary.  Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.  I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be specific!!  Robin 
 The FT-NEAST-WH books were set up in the Agg-Gas II portfolio, but never added to the AGG-GAS III or AGG-GAS IV portfolios.  Please add these books under the J_Mrha porfolio in AGG-GAS III and AGG-GAS IV.  Thanks, Robin

 Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman. Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only going to get worse!!

 I'm going home...can you believe it?  Give me a call when you get out of here.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Not yet.  But I haven't given up yet. 
 I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  Now get back to work!! 
 Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a hotel I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, Robin 
 Frank,  I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once Feb rolles to intramonth the "From date" on the calc is changed from the Jan 1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR calc not the post ids.  Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a while.  Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.  Te quiero. Robin

 That was funny...in fact it was the funniest thing I've heard all morning.  I'd rather go to lunch. Thanks anyway though. 
 I have nothing to do either but I'm just surfing the web.  I'm not as dedicated as you are. 
 Hey,  It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  Enough whining for now.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Wei,  I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.

 You are one sick puppy!!  I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges. Let me know when you get them back and we'll go to lunch. 
 Yeah, give me a call.  I'm headed home to do GMAT homework. 
 Yeah, I heard.  It took an act of Congress and I'm not exactly thrilled. I'll tell you all about it later.  Do you have French tonight? 
 I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should have the "offer" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in the mood for it!!  I'll let you know what I find out. Robin 
 You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing is that Emily finally finished high school.  I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly. I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find something out.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Hey,  I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Lynn,  Have you heard anything from HR?  Is there any hope of me knowing something today?  Thanks, Robin 
 Good b/c I didn't really feel like going anyway. 
 I'm surprised you invited me to the class!! 
 If you wanted to see me for lunch you should have just said so.  There's no need of going to the extreme of having a Spanish class...people are going to get suspicious.  RR

 I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows.  They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup. Actually, I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's her last day.  I would invite you but then you'd just be disappointed when we left without you.

Please let me know if these dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the necessary arrangements.  Thank you for your help, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Here is the file that Kori prepared Friday.  Let me know if you need anything else. Robin 
 Any hope yet? 
 Hey Becky,  Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your knee doing by the way.  I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong. And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's actually going to happen.  You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview, much less to live up there.  Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  Robin 
 I'm in no hurry. 
 What's he doing now?  Let me know when you can get away for a second and we'll go buy stamps.  I just surfing the web to see what I can find out about Chicago, so my schedule's pretty flexible. 
 So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let me know if you want anything from downstairs.  No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually.  Are you still planning to go work out at lunch?  Hope everything gets better. Robin 
 I told Gabriel about your hairdryer story.  He was appropriately disgusted. I'm writing procedures for what I do...ya wanna come help me?

 Harry,  A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday. Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.  Robin 
 Are you sure about that email address???  I sent one and it bounced...or was that just another test? 
 Harry,  A little birdie told me today was your birthday.  Happy Birthday!!!  Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.  Robin

 What's going on?  Nothing is happening down here.  I know I whine when I'm too busy, but frankly I'm having trouble thinking of things to do today.  Are you guys busy?  Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while.  Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.

 It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 You sound chipper anyway.   I'm actually bored today.  We haven't had any problems today.  I'm not used to that so I really know what to do with my time.  That and it's Friday and I don't really want to do anything. 
 How did you get back to your desk that fast? 
 How's you day going?  Mine's much better.  Haven't heard from Canada all day.  Did you come in early today?

 As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was "They'll listen to Sally."  Hehehe.  We'll see, but I'm not convinced that Canada will listen to anyone. 
 So what's the verdict? 
 Kathy,  The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.  Robin 
 Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."  And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian p&l and for the originations total.  Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.  I'll whine more later, Robin 
 I can drive.  So what ever you want.  I was thinking Churassco's, but I'm definitely open to suggestions. 
 Shifali,  Please see the attached email.  If anyone else in your group grants Middle Market Nymex Originations please forward them this email.  Thank you, Robin x57478 
 Are we still on for lunch?  Where do you want to go?  Robin

 You crack me up...I think I only know one person who has worse luck at work than you do, and that would be my EMT friend that broke someone's glass eye. I can't believe your boss is making you work on Monday...even we don't have to work Monday.  I'll talk to ya later, Robin 
 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.  Robin 
 Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.    Enron North America Corp. 
 That's fine.  Just let me know when you want to go.  But give me a few minutes, we're working on something.  It shouldn't take but about 10 minutes. 
 Hey,  How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?  Bye. Robin 
 Beginning this week an Origination report will be given to Fred Lagrasta each morning.  The information for this report is taken from the Origination schedule tab of your P&L file.  It is imparative that all the information is filled out for each origination granted.  The item most commonly overlooked is deal volume.  There is also additional information that is now required for all Middle Market Nymex Originations.  Please add the following columns to your Origination Schedule: Buy/Sell Term of the Deal Price Pub Code  If you have any questions or you are no longer responsible for updating the origination schedule, please call me.

 Unless you want to do it, I'd give it to her.  I hate just standing by someone's desk waiting for them to see me and get off the phone.  Good luck. 
 How funny is that that I was emailing you at exactly the same time you were emailing me! 
 Hey,  What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring. Anything interesting in your world?  It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come visit you before I go to my class.  I don't want to hang around down here until 6.   That is if you aren't too busy today.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 I'm gonna have to kill Rock.  He managed to screw up 3 days worth of Basis Reports on Friday!!  How I have no idea.  I had already rolled everything.  All he had to do was query and calc it.  Go figure.  Robin 
 Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you can stop by and visit.  RR 
 I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my brother's cd.

 Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after Christmas.

 Sorry for kind of cutting you off earlier, but Gossett was hoovering.  It's not exactly career enhancing to make your boss wait.  I'll call you later, Robin 
 What???  I'm confused. 
 What  you talking about, Willis?  I thought you were in Chicago.  Last I heard it was a little bigger than most college campuses.  For sure bigger than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes the day pass much faster.  Good night. Robin 
 Any last words for your car before I leave for my nap??  Don't worry I'm a "safe driver."  I'll sleep a little extra for you.  How's everything going this morning? 
 Hey Becky,  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be running marathons by now.  I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.  Robin

 Accounting Magic.  Am I good or what? 
 Yeah, give me about 10 minutes. 
 You better decide soon.  I'm only waiting on Canada. 
 Read what Kathy wrote...What am I supposed to go tell Lavo he's wrong!!  I know she's the best risk person we have, but give me a break! 
 I'm low on clean clothes...I need to think if I have something to wear! 
 Try this one.    Thanks, Robin 
 Here's the file from Jeff. 
 So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else. 
 I wasn't worried about you making it.  I was worrried about you making it back in time to give me my presents.  I work with a guy in our Chicago office.  He said it was pretty bad there.  I told him you were headed up there and he said he hoped you didn't mind delays.  Glad you made it safely.  You know you can buy disposable cameras at most stores.  Try to stay warm. Robin 
 I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch. If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up for whatever you want to do (within reason that is).  Gotta go Canada's calling. Robin 
 I'm headed to become a "safe driver."  Robin 
 I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's just no pleasing some people.  I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH. Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.  I'll give you a birthday call later. Robin 
 Kathy,  I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position. Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are not shown on this report.  Brian,  I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report containing December 12th basis positions.  Thank you for your help. Robin

 I had to look for something in my sent mail earlier.  At least half, if not more, of the emails I send are to you!! 
 I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.  Robin

 Bon chance en francais! 
 No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible. They just keep saying the same things over and over.  What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later. 
 No not the HR Spy.  I was in the middle of emailing you when Jennifer walked up to chit chat.  I didn't even think about it and left my email up the whole time she was here.  But I went back and read it and I hadn't written anything incriminating yet.  Talk to ya later.  How was Spanish? 
 Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy outside now.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd starting chanting "Sit down, Pat!"  Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip. 
 So is that a yes now or is it still a no? 
 Congrats on finally accomplishing something.  Have got some good gossip, but I almost got busted a minute ago so you're gonna have to wait!!  Robin 
 Brian/Kathy,  I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points. Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Robin

 Here's an example of the GRMS spreadsheet. 
 Are you kidding me?????  I'll be 2008 before we know who won this election!!! 
 If we'd known that we could have stayed longer and had a few drinks.  I haven't accomplished anything since I've been back so it wouldn't have mattered to me. 
 What's going on? 
 Did you get caught sneaking in late?  I didn't.  I don't think anyone knew I was gone. 
 Here you go.  This is the P&L we reported as of 3/2/01.  Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
 Kathy,  I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for December.  Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.     Thanks, Robin 
 Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!!  Later, Robin 
 What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river.  I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday. I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm there of course.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 I have to clean out my inbox every few minutes so someone doesn't see my email pop and see all the emails from you!!  Our "privacy" is definitely not going to last long. 
 I think this is a good chance to get back on our Monday schedule.  Not that I don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I could go to lunch.  Robin 
 You're so sweet.  You're making me miss you already. 
 I definitely have time.  Give me a call when you want to go. 
 How's everything going?  Did you finish on time? 
 Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance.  Robin 
 No Problem! 
 Hope everything's okay today.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent Gossett he kept saying summarize "his" accomplishments, and "his" strengths, etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.  I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.  RR 
 What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start until 8:45 right?  Bye, Robin 
 How do you come up with all this?  Did someone teach you how to write accomplishments?  This is awesome.  I hadn't thought about integrating my goals into my accomplishments.  And you consider me an overachiever!!  Thanks. 
 Please remove me from your distribution list as I have moved to a new group.  Thanks, Robin

Enron North America Corp. 
 How did you start your accomplishments?  About the only thing I'm coming up with is "Once upon a time I didn't work in risk and I had a life."  There's probably a better way to do it though. 
 Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange. Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.  See you at lunch. Robin

 Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last crack b/c if I didn't you would have!  Robin 
 I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the "secret" lasts. Was she mad at you?  Talk to ya later, Robin

 You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get out of here I'm ready to go.  So go home and watch a couple of movies and then I should be ready to go. 
 What you talkin' bout Willis?  Actually I just got back about 3.  I went home and took a little nap!!  It was awesome.  But to answer your question yeah I'm ready to go.  I probably shouldn't leave, but I'm definitely ready!!! 
 You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it should be a nice 20 hour day today.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  Enjoy a doughnut for me. Robin

 Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group so I don't have to do anything.  Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?  Bye-bye. Robin

And no I didn't get much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to bed I just kept waking up.

 Kathy/Brian,  As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are spelled correctly in all position files.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks, Robin

 Vern,  I spoke with Annemieke and she said that you would be the person to contact about adding a report to the executive viewer.  We need to add a gas report. The title of the Report will be Natural Gas Basis by Trader.  I am attaching a copy of the report that will be published.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you for your help, Robin x57478

 Brian,  This file look good.  Are you still using the FTCD file?  If you are, please let me know to what trader to assign the P&L.  Thanks. Robin 
 Jon,  Attached you will find a copy of the basis positions as reported to John Lavorato for November 17.  The positions listed represent the entire Canadian office position at each point.  The attached includes only those points that John Lavorato has requested be reported by trader, not every point at which you have positions.     If you have any questions please let me know.

 Jeff,  I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.  Talk to you Monday. Robin 
 Don't worry there's no rush.  Take your time and exhaust all your other options...don't worry it doesn't hurt my feelings that you are trying desparately to get out of spending the holidays with me.  Just kidding.  Have a good weekend. Robin 
 Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  What'cha doing for lunch?  Robin 
 Have you thought any more about coming with me for Thanksgiving?

 Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space?? I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me the longest and I'm still not happy with it.  Have fun bowling.  I'd love to see your shirt!! Robin 
 Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your boss yesterday?  Later, Robin

 Outside of moving the deals to another book, I don't think you can avoid liquidating at the end of the month.  So I'm going to leave these in the portfolio.  Thanks for the info. Robin    Enron Capital Management

 Stop the madness!!!   What do you mean you're bidding for a company?  Are you writing the bid for your boss?  And why would you be complaining?? 
 I'm so impressed.  You mean you actually got to leave the building...wow. Actually you won't believe this but I left the building for lunch.  I just went to Chick-fil-A, but at least it wasn't Enron. 
 Huh??  I'm confused. 
 Sorry it took me so long to reply, we had a slight crisis here.  I went to Shreveport on Nov. 2.  That would be about right for when you left b/c you left me just in time to have to roll the month by myself...just kidding.  RR 
 I couldn't send myself a net send.  Guess I'll just have to talk to myself the old fashioned way. RR 
 I'm not sure specifically what you're refering to...Do you mean someone on the financial book's love life (ie Susan or Kori), or the HR spy?  Glad it worked, now maybe you won't get fired.  Have you gotten something to eat yet?  Robin

 Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the "fun run" on Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.  As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here. I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in seasoning.  I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might see and for fear he'd think I was interested.  Gotta go to a meeting. Robin 
 We're going to try for the conference room next to Bob Hall's office, but if that's taken we'll just meet at Frank's desk. 
 Frank has asked me to let you know that our VAR meeting will be at  9:30a.m. this morning.  Thanks, Robin

 Lynn,  Do you know anything about the Congress Plaza Hotel?  I was searching for somewhere to stay and it looks pretty convenient to the office.  Thanks, Robin 
 Relative to most of the questions I answer all day, your questions don't even count as stupid!!  Later, Robin 
 That's scary.  It's probably just as well I couldn't open it...I wouldn't have believed it was real if I got that from you.  I would have just spent time trying to figure out what the joke was.  RR

 Hey Becky,  What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war. He said, "Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very well so I left."  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people!!  How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's all anyone's talking about around here.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron statue of a tree?  Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch.  Robin 
 Monica,  I never received your basis positions for Lavorato.  Robin

 I'll be there. 
 Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They screwed their position up again today.  My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a message on it that said, "Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you."  Are we having Spanish class today?  Robin  PS My forearms are a little sore, but that's all. 
 Thanks.  How was the rest of your weekend?  RR 
 Yeah, but you know I can't resist an opportunity to make a sarcastic remark. 
 What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do. Thanks for the help with this.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me. Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well. So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a group of top quality American athletes.  Bye.  PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than Gossett. 
 PS.  Tell him I'm definitely interested. 
 Yeah that very interesting.  What exactly is the origination team doing now that they've already signed the deal with blockbuster?  Are they trying to sign up customers or providers or what?  RR 
 I don't think most people would understand the humor, but I thought it was really funny.  Especially after the week I've had!!  RR 
 It works...that's pretty neat by the way!  See ya Friday (It'll be your turn to vent). Robin 
 Let me know if you need anything else.  Robin 
 I didn't want this just popping up on your screen.  So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.  He must think I'm the biggest idiot in the world.  I'm going to have to change my name to get another job after he fires me.  When he saw me standing outside his office this last time he just spread his hands like what could possible be wrong now!!  If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back now's your chance.  I think John would pay you $100,000 to take back over.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 The Nymex book granted $9,600 of Middle Market Northeast Originations and $7,460 of Middle Market East Origination that the East desk did not recognize on their P&L.  Thanks, Robin

 Chris,  Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need any more information.  Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 contracts over the same period.  Robin 
 Done. 
 Are we still on for lunch? 
 Something is definitely wrong with that man!!!   Why do you always get him started? 
 You probably know the times that will be good for me better than I do.  As for day of the week, I'd rather the first half of the week, nothing after Wed.  RR 
 Done. 
 Friday's no good.  I'm going to Chicago to look for an apartment.  I'm leaving as soon as I pass out all the reports Friday morning.  How about early next week?

 For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!   When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad. When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it every chance I get. When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and to quit complaining. When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your dumb butt. When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the porcelain god. When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt. This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end. Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.  Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!! 
 Phillip,    FYI  I will be on vacation from 9/22 until 10/11.  See you in two weeks. Robin 
 Dawn,  Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know.  Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  Hope you enjoyed your trip.  Robin 
 Hey Greg,  I just got you email, but I do want to be in on the gift for Becky.  Count me in for $20.  I'll bring the money down in the morning.  Where are you located now?  Thanks, Robin 
 See you tomorrow. Robin 
 I'm not here...at least my mind anyway.    I take it you aren't too busy today.  We need to plan on going to lunch sometime soon.  My last day is next Thursday.  Yippee!!  This is my last bidweek...Thank goodness. 
 Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day. The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  Bye, Robin  PS If I forget my bras, I'm just not going to bother!! 
 No one would notice if I forgot my bras!!!!  Thanks for the well wishes. I'll take lots of pictures so you can see them.  I can't wait for this week to be over...only one and a half days!!  Robin 
 I no longer need to receive Hyperion updates.  Thank you, Robin 
 Just a reminder I'll be in Derivatives Tues. and Wed.   I'll have my phone with me in case anyone needs anything.  Thanks, Robin 281-300-9145

 Have a good evening. Robin 
 Okay, here's a trivia question for you.   There are two siblings.  One's an engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting firm?  Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner in New Orleans.  I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the special olympics...then I might stand a chance!  Congrats on the job. Robin 
 I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes. I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know. And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.  We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.  Talk to ya later, RR 
 Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.  What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I enjoy the fact that this is on your company email.  I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I don't think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have two right now.  Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Are you trying to make me blind like you?????  RR 
 I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug them into anything.  I think I'll have them as a decoy in case I end up with an annoying neighbor for the flight.  Everyone around me knows my travel plans as well as I do.  I think I must have become a little annoying myself.  Well back to work.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 What are you doing??  I'm bored.  Did you have a good weekend?  RR 
 You have no idea just how appropriate that is today!!!  Thanks for the laugh!  RR 
 I'll take your Visa.  Just let me know when you've mailed it.    You have a Platinum card, right?  R 
 I actually just did it for my mom...otherwise she wouldn't have gotten a gift at all!! 
 I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my brother's name on the gift.

 How much did you pay for your clubs?  By the way, I thought using company email was a nice touch.  We were named one of the top 100 companies to work for...number 24 to be exact.  They are pushing for #1 next year.   I think it's the Analyst program that's holding them back right now!!!  Well back to pretending to work.  Right now I'm training and there's nothing to do in the middle of the day with this job, so there are two of us trying to stay busy doing nothing right now!  Later, RR 
 You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store). You did a very good job picking it out.  Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them for ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to the driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on this sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the "golf junkies" but I'm not sure you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day thinking "I need that!"  Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Robert,  Here are the machines I've logged on.  1.  The computer to the left of my desk, 3275d.  2.  Both of my machines.  3.  Both of Rock's machines, 3275f.  4.  Gabriel's computer, 3275g.  Thanks, Robin 
 So are you going to enter??? 
 Gabriel,  I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day. However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  Thanks, Robin  PS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd.  I'll be in a little early tomorrow to tie it out for the 24th.  Bye. 
 How scandulous of your mother!!  My mother would never use sucks...but my dad told me something pissed him off one time.  I was completely shocked...I didn't even know what to say.  I know it's hard to imagine me speechless, but I was.  You should know by now that I'm heartless and that my grandmother will have to go the hospital all alone.  I had to listen to her last time whine about how no one respects her.  It took everything I had not to say, "Of course we don't respect you.  We all know you're crazy."  What are you doing for lunch Friday (as in probably the day you're reading this)?  I'm going to come in early b/c I've been bombarded as soon as I walk in the door the last two days.  Let me know if you want to go to lunch.  I'll call you when I get in.  I'll be praying for Megan. Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  It came to our attention yesterday that the PWR-GAS-LT-MGMT-PRC book is included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  This book is officalized by Jenny Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.  Therefore, I don't believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Also please ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Here is the detail and position for IM Canada yesterday.  It seems that the price txt file didn't get run last night (our fault).   I'll make sure that gets done tonight.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course!  Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you know!  RR 
 I will not be able to attend this meeting. 
 Refined Products recognized $30,600 in Originations on their P&L that was not included on their Orig Schedule.  Thanks, Robin 
 I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the bottom.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal carcasses with cancers, tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for human consumption as long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a general loosening of slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends Aug. 29. One critic already weighed in, saying she did not want to "eat pus from a chicken that has pneumonia," but also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, infectious arthritis and diseases caused by intestinal worms.    In Their Own Words  Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his Huge Hooter Haven strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town for the Billy Graham Crusade that weekend: "I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly keep up with preachers. Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never entered my mind that (it was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium."    http://www.msnbc.com/comics/nw.asp 
 Refined Products recognized $6,300 of Originations on their P&L that was not included in the Originations file.  Thanks, Robin 
 I will be attending the dinner.  Thank you, Robin 
 I have not taken any time off this time period.  Thanks, Robin 
 It's a shame you don't know someone who wants to get involved!! 
 Yes, I got it a few minutes after I sent you the email.  Thanks.  Robin 
 Are you still working on the CanadaPower file?? 
 Thanks.  Have a good weekend, and I'm looking forward to the Term book adventure next week.  Robin 
 Tempting, but no thanks...I'm probably more likely to go running at 6am on Sat. than willingly subjecting myself to itchy. 
 Brad,  Here is the book that was set up for John Arnold's crude position.  The attached spreadsheet should contain all the information you need, but should you require additional information please do not hesitate to call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Thanks for making my day by sucking me back into a world with mental images of someone standing there scratching!! 
 A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were lost "in a series of small fires". The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated, nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which  it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that  it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be considered to be an "unacceptable fire," and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he had lost in the "fires". And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine. 
 No prob, bob. 
 The NG Price book granted $1,400 of Middle Market East Originations that was not recognized by the Intra-East book on the NGP&L.  Thanks, Robin 
 Now that was funny!!  RR 
 NOT A CHANCE...I don't even get near the water here!! 
 She's been drinking the water here, hasn't she? 
 You guys should submit an eRequest to get access to all the Gas Reports on the Executive Viewer.  Here's a list of the reports you'll want.  Origination Schedule Natural Gas Prices Natural Gas Basis Positions Natural Gas Profit & Loss by Book Natural Gas Net Fixed Price Positions by Book Natural Gas Basis by Trader  Also, Brad you need to request access to the O:/Bench directory so that you'll be able to save a copy of the NGPL in this directory each night.  Bilal, you'll need access to the O:/Gas_Trad and O:/Bench directories.  Robin 
 There was at least a third of it left, but it's in the trash now.  You're welcome to come get it.  I'm craving the brownies that I know are on my counter at home. 
 I find this joke even funnier coming from an Aggie grad.  Robin 
 The NG Price book granted $500 of Middle Market Central Originations that was not recognized by the Intra-Central book on the NGP&L.  Thanks, Robin 
 That's your FAVORITE joke!  That was a really lame joke...in fact it was pathetic.  Remind me never to take you to an open mike at a comedy club...actually I don't think you'll ever have to remind me! 
 Now I'm scared. 
 Well I feel privileged to be included in your daily entertainment.  RR 
 You must have more fun at your office than we have here...that or you've just lost your mind!!  Robin 
 Here you go.  Robin 
 What kind of twisted diet are you on???   I had a sandwhich.  Nothing too exciting.  Did the potatoes hire anyone?  Later, Robin 
 That's all well and good, but where are my text files???  Just kidding. Robin 
 I would like to change my parking contract from the Clay garage to the Allen Center garage.  Thank you, Robin 
 I would like to change my parking contract from the Clay garage to the Allen Center Garage.  Thank you, Robin 
 No I promise I didn't....your post-id crashed my system.  I had your book and the power book and the Nymex book all coming in at the same time and the system just stopped.  We're going again though, so I should have your position in a few minutes.  RR 
 I would like to attend the Cornell Brown Bag.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Please use the book id FT-CAND-PWR-PRC  and name the file CanadaPower_08022000.  These are the only changes I am having to make each night.  Thanks for your help.  Robin 
 Here you go!  Robin 
 Hey Brian,  I'm having to plug your positions again.  I checked the conversion factors and I have the same ones that you have on the IM Positions tab of your excel file.  Let me know if you have any ideas as to what the problem might be. I'm attaching a copy of the positions that I pulled in and the detail.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.    Thanks, Robin 
 What makes you think I talk to her at all...I just have to listen. 
 Me bored??  I think you must be more bored than me to talk about ear cleaning.  There's this new person that sits down the row from me and she baby talks...what's up with that!  It's so irritating.  Well now that I've gossipped about someone 10ft from me I better send this email before someone walks by and reads it.  I think I'll skip the run this week.  RR 
 You are so picky!!   RR    Enron North America Corp.

 Kenny,  I'm not in accounting any more, so I no longer need this email.  Thanks, Robin 
 I promise I didn't forget about you tonight!  RR 
 Why did you send my message back to me with no reply of your own??? 
 I have not taken any time off.  Thanks, Robin 
 I'm SO Sorry that I forgot about you. 
 Did you get my message about the books? 
 Hopefully the third times a charm!  Robin 
 That was hilarious.  I especially liked the chain saw and the flame thrower!  RR 
 Nancy,  Here's the book request I spoke with you about.   This also needs to be added to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII, AND AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Please include as a separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  Please let me know when this book is set up.  Thanks, Robin 
 It sounds pretty good, but I'd rather talk to mom and see if there's something specific he wants before we get that.  B/c for all his talk about using the computer he usually ends up using his books instead.  I'll call mom either tonight or in the morning.  I'll let you know what I find out.  Robin 
 Hey,  I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny that you wrote that to my from your work email.  Well it's about time I got started working today.  Robin 
 Yeah, like this week.  And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones.  And I can't seem to find my catalog to order mom something.  I requested a new one but I don't know if we'll get it in time.  You need to just go wander around a home depot and find Dad some useless gadget.  Later, Robin 
 Brian,  Well, we're a lot closer, but we're not exact.  I'm attaching a copy of what I pulled when I loaded the new files.     Thanks for your help,  Robin 
 Brian,  Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position. Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve this variance.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how we did.  Robin 
 Brian,  Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all unique what you had was fine.  If you have any more questions just give me a call.    Thanks, Robin 
 Sorry it took so long.  Robin 
 Kathy,  Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.  Thanks, Robin 
 Good luck with your meeting. 
 How is the FT-Exotic file coming?  Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  The INTRA-CNT-TRANS problem was on my end.  It wasn't defined properly in the bench.  Thanks, Robin 
 Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  Did the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book get included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio?  Thanks, Robin 
 Carol,  I have attached the items you requested.  If you need any further information please let me know.  I work in the evenings so if you need anything before 2:00 please call my cell phone.  The number is 281-300-9145.     Thank you for your help,  Robin x57478 
 Here are the FT Positions.  Let me know how they look.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here are the FT Positions including the Exotics.    Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  It seems that the criteria in the GD-NEW-PRC0 portfolio was deleted.  Please add this back so that we can pull positions into the benchmark.  If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Nicole,  This is the position EXCLUDING Exotics.  I haven't been able to load the text file yet.  But I'll send that as soon as I have it.  I also included the detail.  Let me know if I can help.  Robin x57478 
 I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today? I've been "training" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who knew the reports besides me.  I told him it was going to be up to him and Binh to know all the reports.  I told him I wasn't going to leave my new phone number.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 713-345-7478  Thanks, Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  We need to set up a new Intra-Central Physical Book.  INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY  There are already Intra-Cnt-Trans Price, Basis, GD, and IDX books set up. The region code for the physical book should be CENTRLTRSP.  If you have any questions please let me know.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Ramesh,  Here are the Intra-Central books that are pulling the wrong post ids.  Let me know if you need anything else.  BOOK ID   7/7/2000 POSTID  INTRA-CNT-MKT-PHY  773281  INTRA-CNT-MID-PHY  826984  INTRA-CNT-GULF-PHY 483279  INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY 483282  INTRA-CNT-MKT2-PHY 773283  If you have any questions this weekend you can leave me a message at work or call me at home.  My home number is 713-781-0545.  Thanks for your help, Robin x57478 
 Here are your positions including the exotics.  Robin 
 Kathy,  Here are your FT Positions exlcuding the exotics.  Are you going to send me the exotics spreadsheet tonight?    Thanks, Robin 
 Thank you.  Robin 
 Here is the file containing the positions before the exotics file was added, positions including the exotics file and the detail supporting the positions.  If you have any questions give me a call.    Robin 
 Nicole,  These are the FT Canada positions excluding the Exotic text file that Kathy sent.  I'm going to pull it in shortly and then I'll resend you your positions.  Robin 
 Ramesh,  Could you please resend me the email with all your groups pager numbers.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  I just spoke with Gary Stadler and he said the number doesn't really matter for our purposes but it must be unique for the system.  He suggested you just make it a consecutive numbering down the file.  Robin 
 That's just disgusting.  We had PF Chang's.  It was good but it keeps coming back to visit!! Just thought you'd like to know that. 
 Kathy,  I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more guidelines for the text files.  1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)  2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.  3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.  4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a zero.  5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please use a zero.  The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you have any question, please give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel file that Brian saved in the directory.  Thanks, Robin 
 Please format the text files to be processed through GRMS in the following manner.  1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date. 2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97 3) The book names must be the same every day. 4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no value.  GRMS will not recognize a N/A in a field that is supposed to contain a number. 5) Please name the files in a manner consistent with those below.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Is Kathy going to send text files tonight?  Thanks, Robin 
 That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.  Thanks, Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is the New Date Bucket format that we need for your mini-benches for the Benchmark(not the Lavo Bench) for July.  1. July 2. Aug. Index 3. August 4. Sept 5. Oct 6. Nov 7. Dec 8. Jan '01 9.

 Chris,  The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today. However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today. When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here are your positions and I also included the detail.  Let me know!    Thanks, Robin 
 Please set up the following book in the GRMS and in the GRMS Portfolio Heirarchy.  INTRA-CNT-MKT2-PHY  Thanks, Robin 
 Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge $6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him. 
 Here is the detail of yesterday's position.  Let me know if there's anything else you need.    Thanks, Robin x713-345-7478 
 Hey guys,  Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM Canada.  Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve variances before the system is shut down.  Thanks, Robin    PS for future reference my extension is 713-345-7478. 
 rrodri2 sydney2000*  Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go!    Thanks, Robin 
 Here are your positions.  Let me know how they look.    Thanks, Robin 
 I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  Well I better get busy.  Bye.  We still need to go to lunch sometime.  RR 
 I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)  GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9  GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3  GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)  If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic please let me know.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Here you go! 
 David,  Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.  4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process must be started over.  7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position.  8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently in the bench.  10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it.  If you have any more questions let me know.  Robin x57478 
 I told you about this Friday...you were probably just not awake enough to remember.  I'm going up there on Friday morning (after the checks) and coming back Sat. afternoon.  If I can get an apartment Friday I'll probably try to fly standby and come back earlier Sat.

 Virendra,  Please check the set up of the book listed below.  I am having to manually override that post-id everyday.  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you.  BOOKID  6/23/00 POSTID  INTRA-MKT3-PRC 818797  Thanks, Robin 
 Virendra,  Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that are fixed price gas daily deals.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Here are you positions. 
 Gas prices are so high that when I pulled into a station this morning and asked for a dollar's worth, the attendant dabbed some behind my ears.

 Could you please ensure that these books are set up the same in GRMS as in ERMS.  They have been officialized and are still not pulling the positions in automatically.  I am having to manually override the post-ids.  BOOK NAME    6/21/2000 POST-ID  INTRA-CAND-WEST-PHY  816302  INTRA-ST-COVE-BAS   816594  INTRA-ST-COVE-PRC   816593  Thank you, Robin x57478 
 Hey Guys,  We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you show a position of long 241 contracts.     Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Here are your positions.  Let me know if they're okay.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Tomorrow I'm going to be here really early in the morning, so I'll probably be tired tomorrow night.  But I could go to the concert if you can get tickets.  B/c Thursday I'll have to pack and get some sleep for my flying trip to Chicago Friday.  Bye, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Gary,  Could you please add the books below that are in red to the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Thanks for the info on the INTRA-CND  book.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark. Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a copy of what you reported.  As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.  Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Good luck in your new job.  I've had fun teasing...I mean working with you.  Robin 
 I just got your email, so it'll be a little while.  I'll let you know...that or I'll just leave and not bother to tell you! 
 Have you had a chance to review the positions yet??  Robin 
 Hey David,  Please give me a call.  713-345-8960  Thanks, Robin

 I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she ruined your weekend.  I told her you didn't mind that she was here.  What'd you end up doing last night?  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Here are the positions I have.    Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go.  We're only about 6 contracts off.    Talk to ya tomorrow.  Robin 
 Your position still hasn't pulled in...I think the system's just running really slow.  I'll give you a call when I get it.  RR    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
 Hey Jackie,  This is definitely me.  So when did you get here?  And what are you doing? Things are crazy around here so I'll talk to ya later.  Robin    Enron North America Corp.

 Why does that not surprise me.  Besides I told you to wait until you were a little more lucid...that should be much longer than a few minutes...more like a few years!! 
 Read what you wrote sometime when your not so tired, and let me know if you understood it....b/c I sure didn't!!  I have no idea what you're trying to say.  So just imagine me nodding my head and smiling politely.  RR 
 1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.  2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to properly represent originations on the NGP&L.  3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.  4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so that the information                need only be queried once.  This was accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.  6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report to the Benchmark.  7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would like to see them also please let me know.  Thanks, Robin 
 You mean there are Enron employees with spare time?? 
 Yeah, your position has definitely been the bright spot of the day! RR

 That was just plain  MEAN.  I'm having a bad enough day...I don't need your crap too!  Have a good evening.  Talk to ya tomorrow.  RR 
 Sorry it took so long.    Robin 
 Awesome!!  Have a good evening. 
 Here are your positions.  Hopefully we look as good as last night.    Thanks, Robin 
 Why are you still here? 
 It's b/c you don't have me there to control things!!  Just kidding.  Sounds like you as busy as we are.   So quit reading your email and get to work!!  RR 
 GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun? Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a father's day gift for my dad.  Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later. RR 
 Take 2.  See if you like this one better.    Robin 
 Here are you positions.  Have a good evening.    Robin 
 Laura,  Here's what I received from the Analyst program.  Robin 
 Wow,  I think this is a record you guys.  Here are you positions.  Let me know how it looks.  I fixed the conversion factor issue we were having so our out months should be closer tonight.    Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go.  Let us know if there are any problems. 
 I told you I had a rough day!!!  I was DYING by the last game.   I've never felt that out of shape.   So what are you still doing here? 
 You must be having a bad day!!  But you know it's not my fault...and there's nothing soft about softball!!  And I slid yesterday, twice, so I have a little bit of a rasberry on my calf.  Did that get me any sympathy?? Probably not!  I hope you finish close soon. 
 I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that's this sore.  We should be sore though.  We played 5 games.  And I played every second of every game.  Now don't you feel sorry for me?! 
 What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it felt like.  Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always asking and driving you crazy.  Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.  RR 
 Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling different factors.  Let me know how the position looks tonight.    Thanks, Robin 
 I'm sure you were excited to see this email.  You get to reroll the whole year...again!!!  Have fun with that entry.  Robin 
 It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at apartments.  Robin 
 I'm going.  Thanks, Robin 
 Ivonne,  Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I turn it in to?  Thanks, Robin    Enron North America Corp.

 They're great...awesome country music.  Don't be too scared. 
 I don't know I haven't heard anything today. 
 Don't be scared...I'm just kidding. 
 Kathy,  I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to remind him at the end of the month.  I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.   Bilal Bajwa x713-853-3409  P&L-  Bradley Jones  x713-345-8960  Positions- Binh Pham x713-853-5791  Thanks, Robin 
 Oh we're going now...I have the tickets. 
 Got 'em.  Let me know when you can get out of here.  I guess we'll have to ride the bus.  I'm not sure.  Unless you want to try to bribe the parking people again. 
 Wanna go to the Rodeo? 
 I sent Charlene an email this morning and surprise, surprise I haven't heard anything.  Not too much going on right now.  Talk to ya later. 
 I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday.  Robin 
 Did you see?  She completely blew me off.  I submitted a more specific question this time. 
 Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring this up as something great they've done to improve communication.  R 
 Are you watching this eSpeak?  Either no one is asking interesting questions or they are censoring them.  I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned PRC reps, but she hasn't answered that yet. 
 My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake. You'll be invited too of course.  I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?  Talk to ya later Robin 
 Hey Richard,  I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  I'll let you know if anything changes.  Robin 
 Kathy,  I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.    Robin 
 Susan/Nancy,  Please move the following books from J_ARNOLD to M_MAGGI portfolio:  NG-ERMS-XL-PRC NG-EXOTIC-PRC  Thanks, Robin

 Here is the January file.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.    Robin x57478 
 Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We need to all go to lunch before I leave.  Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR 
 As long as he leaves after me I think it's great!!! 
 Hahaha.  That was pretty funny.  I have a feeling that's the reaction my grandmothers will actually have. 
 I thought you  comments about the "flexibility" of the program were hilarious.  I just talked to Laura.   I'm moving to Chicago.  I'll give you all the details and dates later. 
 Susan,  The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named M_Maggi.  If you have any questions, give me a call. Thanks, Robin
