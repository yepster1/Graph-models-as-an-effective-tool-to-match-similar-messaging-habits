s, Robin 
 Sorry it took so long.  Robin 
 Kathy,  Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.  Thanks, Robin 
 Good luck with your meeting. 
 How is the FT-Exotic file coming?  Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  The INTRA-CNT-TRANS problem was on my end.  It wasn't defined properly in the bench.  Thanks, Robin 
 Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  Did the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book get included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio?  Thanks, Robin 
 Carol,  I have attached the items you requested.  If you need any further information please let me know.  I work in the evenings so if you need anything before 2:00 please call my cell phone.  The number is 281-300-9145.     Thank you for your help,  Robin x57478 
 Here are the FT Positions.  Let me know how they look.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here are the FT Positions including the Exotics.    Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  It seems that the criteria in the GD-NEW-PRC0 portfolio was deleted.  Please add this back so that we can pull positions into the benchmark.  If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Nicole,  This is the position EXCLUDING Exotics.  I haven't been able to load the text file yet.  But I'll send that as soon as I have it.  I also included the detail.  Let me know if I can help.  Robin x57478 
 I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today? I've been "training" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who knew the reports besides me.  I told him it was going to be up to him and Binh to know all the reports.  I told him I wasn't going to leave my new phone number.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 713-345-7478  Thanks, Robin 
 Gary/Susan,  We need to set up a new Intra-Central Physical Book.  INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY  There are already Intra-Cnt-Trans Price, Basis, GD, and IDX books set up. The region code for the physical book should be CENTRLTRSP.  If you have any questions please let me know.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Ramesh,  Here are the Intra-Central books that are pulling the wrong post ids.  Let me know if you need anything else.  BOOK ID   7/7/2000 POSTID  INTRA-CNT-MKT-PHY  773281  INTRA-CNT-MID-PHY  826984  INTRA-CNT-GULF-PHY 483279  INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY 483282  INTRA-CNT-MKT2-PHY 773283  If you have any questions this weekend you can leave me a message at work or call me at home.  My home number is 713-781-0545.  Thanks for your help, Robin x57478 
 Here are your positions including the exotics.  Robin 
 Kathy,  Here are your FT Positions exlcuding the exotics.  Are you going to send me the exotics spreadsheet tonight?    Thanks, Robin 
 Thank you.  Robin 
 Here is the file containing the positions before the exotics file was added, positions including the exotics file and the detail supporting the positions.  If you have any questions give me a call.    Robin 
 Nicole,  These are the FT Canada positions excluding the Exotic text file that Kathy sent.  I'm going to pull it in shortly and then I'll resend you your positions.  Robin 
 Ramesh,  Could you please resend me the email with all your groups pager numbers.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  I just spoke with Gary Stadler and he said the number doesn't really matter for our purposes but it must be unique for the system.  He suggested you just make it a consecutive numbering down the file.  Robin 
 That's just disgusting.  We had PF Chang's.  It was good but it keeps coming back to visit!! Just thought you'd like to know that. 
 Kathy,  I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more guidelines for the text files.  1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)  2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.  3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.  4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a zero.  5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please use a zero.  The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you have any question, please give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel file that Brian saved in the directory.  Thanks, Robin 
 Please format the text files to be processed through GRMS in the following manner.  1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date. 2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97 3) The book names must be the same every day. 4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no value.  GRMS will not recognize a N/A in a field that is supposed to contain a number. 5) Please name the files in a manner consistent with those below.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Is Kathy going to send text files tonight?  Thanks, Robin 
 That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.  Thanks, Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is the New Date Bucket format that we need for your mini-benches for the Benchmark(not the Lavo Bench) for July.  1. July 2. Aug. Index 3. August 4. Sept 5. Oct 6. Nov 7. Dec 8. Jan '01 9. Feb '01-Dec '01 10. Jan '02 - Dec '02 11. Jan-Dec '03 12. Jan-Dec '04 13. Jan '05-Dec '10 14. Jan '11-Dec'15 15. Jan '16-Oct '23  If you have any question give me a call.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Chris,  The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today. However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today. When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here are your positions and I also included the detail.  Let me know!    Thanks, Robin 
 Please set up the following book in the GRMS and in the GRMS Portfolio Heirarchy.  INTRA-CNT-MKT2-PHY  Thanks, Robin 
 Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge $6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him. 
 Here is the detail of yesterday's position.  Let me know if there's anything else you need.    Thanks, Robin x713-345-7478 
 Hey guys,  Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM Canada.  Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve variances before the system is shut down.  Thanks, Robin    PS for future reference my extension is 713-345-7478. 
 rrodri2 sydney2000*  Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go!    Thanks, Robin 
 Here are your positions.  Let me know how they look.    Thanks, Robin 
 I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  Well I better get busy.  Bye.  We still need to go to lunch sometime.  RR 
 I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)  GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9  GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3  GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)  If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic please let me know.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Here you go! 
 David,  Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.  4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process must be started over.  7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position.  8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently in the bench.  10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it.  If you have any more questions let me know.  Robin x57478 
 I told you about this Friday...you were probably just not awake enough to remember.  I'm going up there on Friday morning (after the checks) and coming back Sat. afternoon.  If I can get an apartment Friday I'll probably try to fly standby and come back earlier Sat.

 Virendra,  Please check the set up of the book listed below.  I am having to manually override that post-id everyday.  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you.  BOOKID  6/23/00 POSTID  INTRA-MKT3-PRC 818797  Thanks, Robin 
 Virendra,  Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that are fixed price gas daily deals.  Thanks, Robin x57478 
 Here are you positions. 
 Gas prices are so high that when I pulled into a station this morning and asked for a dollar's worth, the attendant dabbed some behind my ears.

 Could you please ensure that these books are set up the same in GRMS as in ERMS.  They have been officialized and are still not pulling the positions in automatically.  I am having to manually override the post-ids.  BOOK NAME    6/21/2000 POST-ID  INTRA-CAND-WEST-PHY  816302  INTRA-ST-COVE-BAS   816594  INTRA-ST-COVE-PRC   816593  Thank you, Robin x57478 
 Hey Guys,  We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you show a position of long 241 contracts.     Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Here are your positions.  Let me know if they're okay.  Thanks, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Tomorrow I'm going to be here really early in the morning, so I'll probably be tired tomorrow night.  But I could go to the concert if you can get tickets.  B/c Thursday I'll have to pack and get some sleep for my flying trip to Chicago Friday.  Bye, Robin 
 Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Gary,  Could you please add the books below that are in red to the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Thanks for the info on the INTRA-CND  book.  Thanks, Robin 
 Kathy,  As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark. Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a copy of what you reported.  As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.  Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Good luck in your new job.  I've had fun teasing...I mean working with you.  Robin 
 I just got your email, so it'll be a little while.  I'll let you know...that or I'll just leave and not bother to tell you!

 I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she ruined your weekend.

 Here are the positions I have.    Let me know how it looks.  Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go.  We're only about 6 contracts off.    Talk to ya tomorrow.  Robin 
 Your position still hasn't pulled in...I think the system's just running really slow.  I'll give you a call when I get it.  RR    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
 Hey Jackie,  This is definitely me.  So when did you get here?  And what are you doing? Things are crazy around here so I'll talk to ya later.  Robin    Enron North America Corp.

 Why does that not surprise me.  Besides I told you to wait until you were a little more lucid...that should be much longer than a few minutes...more like a few years!! 
 Read what you wrote sometime when your not so tired, and let me know if you understood it....b/c I sure didn't!!  I have no idea what you're trying to say.  So just imagine me nodding my head and smiling politely.  RR 
 1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.  2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to properly represent originations on the NGP&L.  3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.  4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so that the information                need only be queried once.  This was accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.  6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report to the Benchmark.  7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would like to see them also please let me know.  Thanks, Robin

 Sorry it took so long.    Robin 
 Awesome!!  Have a good evening. 
 Here are your positions.  Hopefully we look as good as last night.    Thanks, Robin 
 Why are you still here? 
 It's b/c you don't have me there to control things!!  Just kidding.  Sounds like you as busy as we are.   So quit reading your email and get to work!!  RR 
 GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun? Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a father's day gift for my dad.  Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later. RR 
 Take 2.  See if you like this one better.    Robin 
 Here are you positions.  Have a good evening.    Robin 
 Laura,  Here's what I received from the Analyst program.  Robin 
 Wow,  I think this is a record you guys.  Here are you positions.  Let me know how it looks.  I fixed the conversion factor issue we were having so our out months should be closer tonight.    Thanks, Robin 
 Here you go.  Let us know if there are any problems. 
 I told you I had a rough day!!!  I was DYING by the last game.   I've never felt that out of shape.   So what are you still doing here? 
 You must be having a bad day!!  But you know it's not my fault...and there's nothing soft about softball!!  And I slid yesterday, twice, so I have a little bit of a rasberry on my calf.  Did that get me any sympathy?? Probably not!  I hope you finish close soon. 
 I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that's this sore.  We should be sore though.  We played 5 games.  And I played every second of every game.  Now don't you feel sorry for me?! 
 What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it felt like.  Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always asking and driving you crazy.  Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.  RR 
 Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling different factors.  Let me know how the position looks tonight.    Thanks, Robin 
 I'm sure you were excited to see this email.  You get to reroll the whole year...again!!!  Have fun with that entry.  Robin 
 It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at apartments.  Robin 
 I'm going.  Thanks, Robin 
 Ivonne,  Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I turn it in to?  Thanks, Robin    Enron North America Corp.

 I don't know I haven't heard anything today. 
 Don't be scared...I'm just kidding. 
 Kathy,  I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to remind him at the end of the month.  I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.   Bilal Bajwa x713-853-3409  P&L-  Bradley Jones  x713-345-8960  Positions- Binh Pham x713-853-5791  Thanks, Robin 
 Oh we're going now...I have the tickets. 
 Got 'em.  Let me know when you can get out of here.  I guess we'll have to ride the bus.  I'm not sure.  Unless you want to try to bribe the parking people again. 
 Wanna go to the Rodeo? 
 I sent Charlene an email this morning and surprise, surprise I haven't heard anything.  Not too much going on right now.  Talk to ya later. 
 I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday.  Robin 
 Did you see?  She completely blew me off.  I submitted a more specific question this time. 
 Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring this up as something great they've done to improve communication.  R 
 Are you watching this eSpeak?  Either no one is asking interesting questions or they are censoring them.  I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned PRC reps, but she hasn't answered that yet. 
 My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake. You'll be invited too of course.  I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?  Talk to ya later Robin 
 Hey Richard,  I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  I'll let you know if anything changes.  Robin 
 Kathy,  I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.    Robin 
 Susan/Nancy,  Please move the following books from J_ARNOLD to M_MAGGI portfolio:  NG-ERMS-XL-PRC NG-EXOTIC-PRC  Thanks, Robin

 I will be starting in the Chicago office on March 12th.  My move date is March 8th.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks for your help, Robin 
 Here is the January file.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.    Robin x57478 
 Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We need to all go to lunch before I leave.  Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR 
 As long as he leaves after me I think it's great!!! 
 Hahaha.  That was pretty funny.  I have a feeling that's the reaction my grandmothers will actually have. 
 I thought you  comments about the "flexibility" of the program were hilarious.  I just talked to Laura.   I'm moving to Chicago.  I'll give you all the details and dates later. 
 Susan,  The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named M_Maggi.  If you have any questions, give me a call. Thanks, Robin
