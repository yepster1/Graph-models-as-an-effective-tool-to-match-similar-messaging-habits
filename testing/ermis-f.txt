 Rhino here. 
 According to my calculations,  the term needs to go through Feb04.  The physical fixed price would be 7.34.

  How  are you? 
 Last night I was interviewed by Shern-Min Chow, I was quoted as saying "I don't know if he's gonna take the money.  He might turn it down, there are rumors to that effect."  I apologize for making that statement.  In the future, I will not give quotes other than "no comment." 
 I WOULD LIKE ACCESS TO PRODUCTS 44355 AND 40163.  THANK YOU 
 Per Mike Grigsby, we need a physical product setup for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission Company - Stanfield.  If you have any questions call me, x3002  Thanks Frank
