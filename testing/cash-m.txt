 Sure, you could ask.  I think that Kriste's draft was prepared before my draft, which I sent to Rosen in executable form.  Britt, by copy of this email, I'll ask Twanda to send you the copies from my file here.  Thanks for the update.  Michelle

 Tara,  We can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract.  Have we already sent you executables?  If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, "Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."  The effective date still can be 6/1.  Twanda, would you please make that change and run executables?  Thanks.

 Privileged and Confidential -- Advice Covered by the Attorney-Client Privilege  K2:  I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME region.  My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high. Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Matt,  Thanks for your email.  I believe that there is an agreement in place between ENA and Enron Expat Services.  In general, the contract is between ENA and the employee, if the person is an expat.  The assignment letter covers the employee's transfer to Expat Services.  We haven't usually amended/assigned the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are through ENA.  If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, and I am happy to handle it.  If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.  I hope this answers your questions.  I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several years.  If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions.  Thanks a lot.

 Shanna, we certainly can hire and manage him out if the performance is not there.  Do we not think he'll be a good performer?   Michelle

 Hello!  Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.  As I mentioned to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.  Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the unionized employees.   I'll provide details as I learn them.  I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dee/Pat/Rick:  Here is the diligence memo.  Michelle 
 Pat,  Thanks for your comments on the agreement.  As an FYI, the stock awards already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to address that situation.  I appreciate your other thoughts.  Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an example as suggested by Pat?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I agree with Brian.  I recently learned that someone can "hack" into the emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, this morning).  So, we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system.  I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor.  I agree with Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the chairman and not the content of the email itself.  I am happy to assist in any way you would like.  Michelle 
 Dick, Here are the details about the GPG PRC meeting.  Please note that these people have not been involved in the process for very long and thus, this may not be the best example of how the process works.  Nonetheless, it should give you a flavor of how it works.  When you get to the Enron Building, please ask for me or my assistant, Twanda Sweet, and one of us will take you to the conference room.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Peter, here are preliminary comments from Pat Mackin on the PSA.  Michelle 
 Attached is a draft memo regarding the above-referenced. 
 Hoyt, I suggest that we get Aaron Brown and Sheila Knudsen working on the issue of deferred comp. to work with Dee on this comparison.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Patrick, do you have any comments to this?  Michelle 
 Attached is a one-page outline summarizing the issues relating to Jim Ajell= o,=20 who recently left ENA to work for Reliant Energy.  By hard copy, I am sending you the following:  (1) a copy of the lawsuit EN= A=20 filed against Ajello, and (2) a copy of Ajello=01,s Employment Agreement, w= hich=20 is highlighted for your convenience.  If you have any questions or require additional information, please call me= =20 at (713) 853-6401. 
 Gina,  Have we figured out what happened here?  I haven't heard anything in a while.  Michelle 
 Andrea,  You are right.  I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who was setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not intentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings.  I am sorry about this one.  Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a compensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp, promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people lots of heartburn.  To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating.  For example, a "strong" performer really could be excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third category.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old "HR" language.  For example, a category 1 performer would have a descriptor that said something like:  "Always raises the bar; franchise player," etc. rather than a "HR" definition relating to demonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference between the two.  There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC appeared to be a "black box," and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process.  This was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Michelle 
 I think that gathering this information at interview makes the most sense. Obviously, new hire orientation is too late!  I prefer an original, signed document, but a fax is an ok substitute, provided that the applicant mails us the originals after faxing.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Gina, I will leave this to your discretion.  I agree that the OD&T people could help us in the communication/training side of any changes that are made.  Comp. probably will not be affected much, since Needs Improvement and Issues both are no bonus/no merit categories.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, thanks for the update.  By the way, did you talk with  Fran Mayes, who went to the management presentations last week?  She may have some of the missing information.  Dee, you might want to check with her for data. Thanks.  Michelle 
 Mary, yes, it merely is a form issue.  Sharon and Kriste have consolidated those paragraphs in their form.  I will follow suit in mine to minimize confusion and to keep the "one template" concept intact.  Michelle 
 Mark,  The pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that people are being paid equitably.  Given that the company has until November of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue, it should be no big deal -- unless there currently are pay inequities.  A list of persons in each job, with salary and gender, could allow us to determine whether an issue even exists.  Michelle 
 Sharon, Kriste, and I discussed this, and agreed that simple was better.  We also thought that a reference to the Enron Employee Data Protection Policy and the Code of Ethics provisions on data should be referenced, with a link, if possible.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Mary, I won't be able to call her until next week because I'm going to be out/tied up the rest of this week.  I am fine if you want to call her.  My only caution would be that you give her data only about our structure -- not why we set it up the way we did or anything else that would be privileged and confidential.  The structure itself would not be privileged -- only our strategies and basis for setting it up that way would be.  If you don't mind a delay in the return call, I'll do it next week.  Just let me know. Thanks.  Michelle 
 please print for me as well as attachemnts.  thanks. mhc 
 Attached is a draft of the Agreement for Recruiting or Contract Personnel Services.  This draft combines the Master Services Agreement, the Agreement for Project Services, and the Staffing Services Agreement into a single, comprehensive document.  Attached to this, as applicable, will be a Project Work Description ("PWD") and/or a Staffing Services Description ("SSD").  I understand that HR is working on a revised PWD.  I will circulate the SSD in the near future.  It will contain a more specific description of staffing services (e.g. retained/contingency) as well as pay rates.  Please review this draft to determine if it fits your needs.  Feel free to throw darts!  Let me know by return email if you have comments or questions. I will resolve as many as possible based upon your comments as well as those of others in Legal, and circulate a revised draft based upon those comments.  Thank you. 
 Kay, 10/10 works for me at 4:00.  If that date doesn't work, would you please include my assistant, Twanda Sweet, on the distribution, given that I will be out at the law conference for the rest of the day and tomorrow?  Thanks. Michelle 
 I'm here til 3:30, when meetings begin. . .  thanks!  mhc     Enron North America Corp. 
 fyi. 
 Ben, there should be a standard form for this -- check with Candace.  If not, let me know.  Michelle

 Clark, Thank you; I received this and will look over your comments.  If I have any questions, I'll give you a call.  I appreciate being included. Michelle 
 please calendar for me.  Thanks!!  You also should attend if you are interested.  Michelle 
 Cathy, let's talk about the outstanding issues on Monday so that we can wrap these up.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Dave,  Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 No, I have not sent any information.  I doubt that Hoyt has, either.  You send them the information before they sign.  I would just do a cover memo and references the agreement, where there is a specific provision about receipt of information. Thanks.  MHC     Enron North America Corp. 
 What about Paskoff?  His lawyer is calling me.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 sounds fine to me.  Michelle 
 those look good.  Has Sheng already signed?  Let me know.  Also, we need an answer on Paskoff; his lawyer called again.  Thanks.  MHC     Enron North America Corp. 
 Dave, why don't you send it to Steve for review.  The consultant doing the training will be working from this.  When do we want to set up the training?  Our lawyers are ready to go.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Drew,  Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who has had some issues.  I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his agreement.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you fax it to my house first thing in the morning?  713-218-7355 is the fax number.  If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I will prepare on this topic.  I am going to be attending a seminar out of the office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.  I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and Louise for comment and dart-throwing.  I can be reached via my cell phone during the day at 713-302-5522.  Thanks, Drew.  Michelle 
 Drew, thanks, I got it.  I'll be sending out an email on this in the next couple of hours.  I'll send it to you and Robert first.  You can run it by Chapman and/or outside counsel in London today. If everyone is in agreement as to the approach, we can send it to Louise asap.  More to come . . . . Michelle 
 Dee,  I assume that you will go through these documents for benefits/plan issues and then send relevant ones to Pat this week.  If that is not your plan, let me know.  Thanks!  Michelle 
 More info about Bond.  Michelle 
 Here is the agreement for Lutz.  Michelle 
 David,  I am in agreement with you on this.  This week, we lost an agreement that had options to be granted.  It did not make it to the Administrative Committee until 2 months after signing, and only because the employee came forward and asked about her grant.  Luckily for us, the strike price was better/lower. If it had been the other way around, we may have had a much bigger issue.  Michelle 
 Thanks.  What about the COBRA amounts?  Are they correct?  I will be glad to close this one out, too!  Michelle    Enron North America Corp. 
 hi, Trang,  I would like to have a little more information about this.  Who is she sending emails to?  When were they sent?  Have all the bills been paid?  etc.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy. 
 Pat,  Here is the latest PSA draft for a  We've agreed to pay $1mm of the severance.  We also have agreed to pay the cost of 2000 bonuses.  On options, there is a proposal for Enron to supervest the employees' options at closing -- can we agree to that? I didn't think so.  your comments would be appreciated.  Michelle 
 David,  The "gardening leave provision would apply beyond the term.  I will make your tweak to 3.4.  I checked the 12-months with Clayton Utz, and they thought it was ok.  I'll forward a new draft in the next day or so.  Hope you had a good trip back.  MIchelle 
 Have him interview with Dan Rogers, Alan Aronowitz, Barbara Gray, and ask them who else they would like to have talk with him.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 please preparre a "no thanks" letter to this person.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dan, what is the status of this deal?  I hadn't heard anything for a few days, and I knew we were on a tight time frame.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 David,  The document you gave me is the form assignment letter that I have prepared for many Bridgeline personnel.  Do we need to do anything to tweak it?  How do you want me to proceed?  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 please save, run spell check, and print for my review.  I think that Robert Jones or Oxley will have to sign it instead of me, since I am not an officer.  Thanks.  MHCC 
 Add Tweed to the persons to interview Carlos Sole.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Sheila,  HR is setting up interviews with Carlos next week, and you will be on the interviewer list.  Thanks!  How would you like references run on Bonnie?  Internally or pre-Enron.  Let me know, since this is the first time I have received that request (given that I am new in this role!).  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Barbara, HR should be contacting you about interviewing him next week..  A number of folks are interested in Carlos!  Thanks for the response.  Michelle 
 Mark, as an update, I am meeting with Carlos tomorrow.  He will interview with a number of folks next week, including Sheila, Barbara, Alan, and Dan (all of whom expressed an interest in talking with him about working in their groups).  Assuming all goes well, I'll schedule a meeting with you after that.  Michelle

 What is the answer?  Michelle 
 Jeff, Good luck with the EES rotation.  I would like to clarify one thing: at this point, I don't know for sure if we are having law students work with us during the summer.  Why don't you check with me in April or May to see whether we are hiring summer associates.  If so, you are welcome to go through the interview process.  Thanks.
