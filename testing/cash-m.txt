 I think that we should enforce the agreement. Did he get a signing bonus?  If so he probably will have to pay back. He also will have to hnor noncompete.  What happened with Brent Price?  Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 Kathy,  Would you please get access to expertfinder reinstated for my group:  me, Lizzette Palmer, Twanda Sweet, and Diane Goode?  Thanks a bunch!!  Michelle 
 I left a voice mail for Terrie, indicating that I think we should close out this communication with something to the effect of:  "If you have further questions, please contact ________________." 
 This looks fine with me. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 Thanks. We're using Weil. Talk to you soon. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I would say that we should honor the terms of any sale or acquisition agreement with regards to service bridging. If we agreed to do so, then our records should reflect that service date. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 The answer is no.  We can't provide personnel information to anyone outside the company.  Not appropriate at any time.  Michelle 
 sounds good

 I am working with Mary Joyce on that right now. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I think we should consider this request. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I think that the answer is that she will be eligible for the $4500 and will be allowed to continue whatever medical coverage she had elected already until 12/31.  Please refer her to the Q&As on the web site for details.  Michelle 
 I have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.  They want the following asap:  Signed copies of contracts for Greg Whalley and Vince Kaminsky (who may not have a contract) Sample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily Signed sample agreement for an IT person, such as Jay Webb (I think I can get this one as well).  They also want the following data for the 838:  Name Position/title 2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc) Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc.  (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number) If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract Did the person get a stay bonus last week?  If so, amount. Date of hire If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.  They are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 please file "Pam Benson".  Thanks.  MHC 
 please file in Diomedes' file.  Thanks.  MHC 
 fine with me.  mhc 
 You need more than the 840 for this -- you also need the IT personnel.  I'll forward those to Kathy so she can get started.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 No risk to non-compete.  The payment obligation is one that is independent of non-compete.  MHC 
 Here is the second list.  Michelle 
 I got this request a second time.  Probably Fran would have the best knowledge of exactly how these people were paid. 
 Alan,  I got a request from Carey Sloan that we confirm in writing that he was no longer an officer or board member of any Enron entity as of the last date of his employment.  Can we do that?  If so, who can assist?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda,  We missed Diane's birthday on Friday -- I can't believe I forgot it!!!  I'd like to get cake Monday afternoon.  Michelle 
 We are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I agree. But we should pay them the 4500. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 We have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer would not be taking them.  However, we have a data room list that specifies what was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room.  We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.  Let me know if you have questions.  Which deal are you actively working on?  Fire or Wind?  Do I need to be working on the draft agreement?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are my comments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Go ahead and let them stay until vesting.  Please reverse their terminations and see if there is any work they can do until the termination day.  If they got the $4500, offset that amount from pay.  Michelle 
 We will need to look at our vacation pay practice with Weil to determine whether we can pay out in the future for accrued, but unused vacation. I think we can say that they'll get no less than $4500, but we want to confirm with Weil. Don't know about parking/bus.  I think it is regular course, but we may have to change that regular course. 
 I agree -- involve Valeria.  You also should invite my new lawyer, Lizzette Palmer.  Twanda is her assistant, also.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Mary jean. Did you get ok from your partners to publish 401k info to public and employees?  PR seems to think that Glen signed off on doing it. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 yes, I approved, after talking wtih Weil.  Michelle

 Hi, Randy.  I hope you are doing ok.  I thought you might be interested to learn that Victoria Sterling amended her lawsuit to add Enron as a party on Nov. 30.  Of course, the claim will be stayed due to bankruptcy, but it is interesting that she finally did it.  Take care.  Michelle

 Good morning.  David has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.  We will need those segregated as follows:  Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks. Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations. EEL employees Employees remaining in the Enron estate.  Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.  Thanks!!  Michelle 
 Maureen, as soon as I receive anything, I'll forward it on.  I am working on it and have been since yesterday.  Michelle

 Don't give SSNs.  I'd suggest giving names only. 
 Are we agreeing to this? 
 Given that this has not been communciated to current employees, I believe that we should consider whether we want to continue this strategy at this time.  It strikes me as something that should be discussed at the management committee level, as that was the group that made this decision last summer.  Michelle 
 I'd transfer to ENA effective 1/1.  If the people have employment agreements, we will need to assign.  Michelle 
 How does he want to change it?  If it is more generous, then I think we should discuss.  Michelle

 lizzette has taken the lead on this immigration issue.  thanks.  michelle 
 no, it looked suspicious, so I didn't open it.  Fax is 713-646-3490. 
 Diane/Lizzette --  I would say that the background check issue is a business call.  They are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks.  Same with the guarantee language.  If there is a change, however, I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement.  That way, we won't have to live with it for every placement.  Michelle 
 Yes, do a wire.  Her check to IRS will bounce if we don't handle it today.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 We are working through that issue this week.  Michelle 
 yes, we will.  michelle 
 Kalen, do we still have the disclaimer on these?  I'd like to make sure that it appears on every set.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Go ahead and give her a call -- let's get it right, even if it causes a few minutes' delay.  If anyone on this email knows how to contact her quickly, then have her give Mike Jones a call asap.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Bob,  I am happy for you to handle the Richter matter.  Lizzette Palmer on my team has been taking the lead on NEPCO matters, so get with her on details.  I'll confirm with David Lund that he has no objection.  Michelle

 Have we assigned employees to netco?  I didn't think we had. In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ena and have them hired by netco after closing.

 in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation. We haven't made that decision here though.  As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term. I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not.

 who is handling reinstatement for ENA? 
 David,  I think we should remove anything relating to the components of a retention -- i.e., whether it is RS or cash -- and any thing relating to vesting.  No way to predict at this time.  As I have more comments, I'll send them on.  Mich 
 One other thing -- Texas law will apply to those employees in Texas, as state courts will not allow other laws to govern in employee matters.  Oregon is the same.  As I re-read, I found more references to vesting or payout dates.  Again, these should be more generic or blank.  Michelle 
 Unfortunately, no.  We have to get those approved by creditors here first.  Bummer.  Michelle  Merry Christmas!
