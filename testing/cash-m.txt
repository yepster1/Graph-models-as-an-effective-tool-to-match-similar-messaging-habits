an empathetic ear, give me a buzz.  Talk to you later.  Michelle  PS  I saw Julie Parraguirre last night, and she told me to say hello.  She is going to be teaching at the same school that Cameron attends! 
 Great.  Our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on Saturday night.  If you want to attend, let me know, and we will get tickets.  It is Cleopatra -- a world premier -- and it should be entertaining.  I understand if you don't want to join us, though.  Ballet isn't for everyone.  Let me know.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please print this out and also print out the consulting services agreement form for my review with this.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Hello.  Do you think this should be included in our consulting agreement form?  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please make this change to all forms?  Thank you.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please print all these.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Drew,  At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.  I think that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we begin to move towards shared services across the organization.  Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we really need to put some in place).  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please save this as a form.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the best.  I could use 5x7" the most.  Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.  We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know.  See you later.  Michelle 
 Please print the email and the attachments.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Pat, here are the draft plan documents.  Any comments would be appreciated. Michelle 
 Here it is.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please save under Japanese labor law memo and print for me.  Thanks. Michelle 
 John,  Do you have any comments on this letter?  Rick and I would like to send it out soon.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 TWanda, please print and then save the attachment as HR Confidentiality /Non-Solicitation agreement -- print for my review and editing.  Thanks a lot.  MHC 
 I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP incentive plan.   She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.  Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the plan.  Jeanne, could you please circulate one?  I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this process should not wait for me.  Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we should be ready to finalize it.  Michelle Cash 
 Attached is a letter to Sue Haynes and Samantha Ray re confidentiality. 
 Call me if you have any questions.  I hope this is better late than never! Michelle 
 Elspeth, do we want to do a new agreement, or simply assume the obligations in the old one?  If the former, I'd do a new agreement.  If the latter, I believe I simply can do an assignment agreement, once I receive a copy of the current agreement.  It also depends on the language in the old one, and whether we believe it protects ENA.  So, we'd have to look at it.  Sharon, do you have the file on this person?  If so, let me know, and I will have someone come and pick it up.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are details on one search firm for legal.  thanks.  mhc 
 Jeff,  What is the status of the document?  I expect that Jon will be calling me any day.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please save this in whatever power point directory you have.  Then, print for me to revise for a presentation to Energy Operations for Norma. Save this one, though, because the one I am going to use for Energy Ops will be much shorter, and this one has good stuff in it!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Kerry, thanks for this -- wow, is it long!  Michelle 
 FYI 
 How is the research going on whether we can set up the plan the way we want to?  My understanding is that you were going to do some research for us. Thanks.  Michelle 
 Attached is a revised copy of the Separation Agreement and Release for Mary Jane Brodsky. 
 Sylvia/Sharon:  I assume that copies will be provided to me and Kriste as well.   I would appreciate the opportunity to review them.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Rick, are you on this, or should I get on it?  Michelle 
 Hi, Charla,  I have reviewed the additional fields you described.  Most of them look fine with me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from any other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity. What is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a person is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have a field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the situation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work visa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.  The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth information that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it really is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is there a less intrusive way to ask it?  Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that inquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?  Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be unwise for the reasons I cited above.  If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call.  Michelle 
 I inadvertently forgot to "Reply to All" when I sent this response to Charla.  Michelle 
 Kathy, here is Ann Park's due diligence template for Canada, which should be of use in Project Canary.  Michelle 
 T:  Would you please print this and attached and file in BP amoco file? Thanks.  MHC 
 Jon, it was attached to the bottom of his prior email, which I will resend to you right now.  MHC 
 Any idea why they did this?  Michelle 
 That was sent to you by messenger.  Getting it notarized may take a long time -- is it necessary?  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please print this for me?  Thanks.  MHC--my printer is not working (or maybe I haven't selected my local printer correctly) 
 FYI.  Here is most of the information.  Michelle 
 Twanda, could you please start Consulting Services AGreements for these entities?  I have asked Norma to get the rest of the information.  Thanks.  MHC

 I sent Milnthorp and Lemmons to you.  I sent Brown to Tara Rozen in London. Clemmons final will go today.  Do we need to talk about Josey and Thompson?  Michelle     David Oxley 05/12/2000 07:27 AM 
 Tim, was it accepted by the court?  Michelle 
 Tara, perhaps the Brown contract should have gone to Melissa instead of you -- sorry.  Could you please let me know if I need to re-route or do anything else on that agreement?  Oxley is anxious for it to get to him.  thanks. Michelle 
 Welcome to the heat!!!  If you would re-send your resume to me, I'll re-send it to my contacts here in town and let them know that you now are available.  I think I may have a firm that could use your skills!  Michelle     "Emma Caplan" <emmacaplan@bootsnall.net> 05/12/2000 10:45 AM 
 Looks good to me, although I will have a new fax number soon.  I will ask Twanda to send it to you once I know what it is.  Michelle     LaVerne Essoufi@ENRON 05/12/2000 10:49 AM

 Bryce,  I am not comfortable with bringing someone in without an agreement.  I should have a draft to you this afternoon at the latest, so it should not be a problem for the person to start tomorrow.  I will ask my assistant, Twanda, to send you the confidentiality agreement that we require all contract personnel to sign so that you can get it to the person for signature today.  Michelle     Bryce Baxter 05/15/2000 08:40 AM 
 Pete,  I learned today of a deal involving a newsprint plant in New Jersey, which you are running from the legal side.  Are there any issues involving personnel or labor involved in this deal?  If so, I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I've asked them for dates, and I've got them from 2 of them.  Let me bug them again early next week.  Tell him to chill out -- his client's deposition has been scheduled and rescheduled too many times to count. 
 FYI, I just learned that Jeff Golden is going to work for EES.  Michelle 
 Twanda, I will have inserts to the two agreements for Bryce Baxter from this document.  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please print this for me?  I will need to have it executed.  Thanks.  MHC

 Hi, Kelly,  Yes, I probably am the person to contact on this.  In fact, I am getting ready to circulate a draft data protection policy that would put Enron in compliance with EU directives.  Look for it in the next few days!  Michelle     Kelly Noel Higgason@ENRON 05/19/2000 03:13 PM 
 Hi, Linda.   I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too.  I was out on vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.  I hope that ELM has received the response by now.

 Jim/Don,  Do you know anything about this for Ecogas?  Michelle Cash 
 Kerry,  What are your thoughts on this issue?  Michelle    Michelle,  We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.  For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the Night (N) shift.   M T W Th F S  REG  8 8 8 8 8 OT       8 SHIFT  N N D D D D   Interpretation 1  The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:  REG  $400 SHIFT       16 OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)   Interpretation 2  Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as follows:  REG  $400 SHIFT       16 OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)  Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them?  Thanks for your help, Diane 
 David,  I am with you.  In fact, I sent this issue to outside counsel earlier this week because I simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts.  I expect an answer by Monday or Tuesday.  Sorry I forgot to let you know about the status.  Michelle     David O'Dell@ENRON 06/09/2000 09:45 AM

 Jennifer,  Thanks for the email.  Cameron is great.  He loves his new school, even though it is not as "working parent friendly" as Cathedral House was.  Cameron also loves fire engines (and ambulances, and tow trucks, and bulldozers and ..... ).  We took Cameron to the Bellaire EMS Open House a few weeks ago.  He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver's seat and "drive."   They also handed out plastic fireman's hats. He had a blast!  I look forward to having you back on 36;  I'm moving there as soon as they get my phone/computer set up -- I'll spend half days there.  See you later.  Michelle     Jennifer Milligan 06/13/2000 03:24 PM 
 Earline,  The questions are as follows:  1.  Has Enron provided Ecogas with such coverage for its non-Enron board members so far? 2.  What is the general scope of such coverage?  Ecogas is a stand-alone company.  Enron owns about 85 percent of its stock and has three people on its Board.  I hope that helps.  Michelle     Earline Kendall 06/14/2000 10:19 AM 
 Shelly, because he should have received this much sooner, we should hand deliver the check as soon as we get it from AP if it is not done through direct deposit.   If it is, then mailing the pay advice is ok.  Thanks. Michelle     Shelly Pierce@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 06/15/2000 01:13 PM

 Sheila, do you think we should meet with Rick Buy about this?  Or, should we talk about it without Rick and then respond accordingly?
