 Trey, it looks like I may have to be in Portland for a mediation on July 27 -- with travel on the 26th and the 28th.  Are you planning to be gone then, too?  If not, I'll schedule this trip (wanna join me with CAC and spend the weekend?).  I hope you are having fun and not working too hard.  Don't worry too much about me.  Gwyn is coming over to join us for dinner tonight, and Kay is dropping by tomorrow -- she offered to watch Cameron if I needed to do stuff.  I do miss you, though.

 Sheila, do you think we should meet with Rick Buy about this?  Or, should we talk about it without Rick and then respond accordingly?  The bottom line is, that the non-compete probably should stay as is, even in the case of RAC. Let's discuss.

 Jim,  If you are sure you don't want reimbursement, then thanks a lot!!!  I hope that you both can join us.  If not, let's plan on another arrangement.  We are planning to stay at the Doubletree Suites in/near Georgetown (apparently, it is close to the Watergate).  It was way less expensive than the Embassy Suites we discussed the other day (approx. $100 per night!).  We are renting a car, though, so we can get around wherever we need to -- or, of course, we can take the Metro.  Talk to you later.

 Dear Gretchen:  Wow!  You are thinking ahead!  What is a Leap Pad?  Is it something computer related? I have never heard of it.  On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice and hot by then.  We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while we are there, so that is good.  We got new furniture in the living room -- a chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.  It amplified the need for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we go!  Stay cool -- Michelle  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------  Michelle Cash Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3823 Houston, Texas  77002 (713) 853-6401 michelle.cash@enron.com  This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

 Thanks for the description.  Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went onto Amazon.com to look at it.  It looks like a cool toy that Cameron would enjoy.  FYI:  the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys.  As a matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to DC in August!

 Dee,  I left you a voice mail yesterday, but I wasn't sure if you were in.  There is a new deal -- Project E2/Endeavor.  It is in the preliminary stages, but the deal team (led by Don Miller) would like to have data regarding the average cost of Enron employee benefits, broken down by type of benefit, if possible.  I assume that you would have that type of data and could forward it to Don and me.  Let me know if I should be contacting someone else.  Thanks a lot!

 Cheryl,  Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I had a blast with you being here.  I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.  I still have the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).  Cameron perked right up after the antibiotics kicked in.   He is his usual self today (happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.  I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.  gotta go.  Michelle 
 Enron North America had some summer clerks this summer.   Generally, we do not hire lawyers without significant legal experience (i.e., more than 6 years) unless they have some extraordinary skills and abilities (e.g., someone with lots of Enron experience).

 Pat, here is additional information about the transaction we have been working on.  Of course, they are going to finalize tomorrow.  I agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation.  Do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk?  My thought would be to request an indemnity for the t.i. claim if it is received.  Alternatively, we can ask for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that  the buyer be a beneficiary/waived party.  Any ideas?  Michelle 
 Amy,  Is Patrick Chris Mallory located in Portland or in California?  If California, then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes are not enforceable in California.  Let me know.  (I hope he is in Oregon!)  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat,  I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement for Greg Whalley.  I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation of value for options/restricted stock.  For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my assistant send it under separate email cover.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Here's the latest.  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained  The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be "represented" by a co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.  Employees in unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended by the NLRB's ruling.  The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be appealed quickly.  Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed before responding to that request.  We want to be careful to avoid a finding of an unfair labor practice.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Kristina,  Attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ENA voluntarily (although I don't really know why we limit it to voluntary terminations -- I have to look into that).  I also will send you by messenger the draft letter to a company (which I don't have on the system) and the letter I sent to the individual we discussed.  I hope these help.  Let me know if you would like additional information.  Michelle

The Seller is providing a limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.  The indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those employees.  This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.  The indemnity exclusion also could be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.  Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  I can assist  you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.  Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.

 Attached for your review is a memo from Michelle and Kriste regarding the above referenced.  memo  Assignment Letter 
 I am going to send these one at a time because they want all fit in one email. 
 Twanda, could you please print for my review?  Thanks a lot!  MHC 
 t; please prnt for me thx 
 Ann, I am following up on the status of the research involving Section 6.4 of the SPA; specifically, what are the potential liabilities of Enron selecting persons for termination and providing those names to the Seller?  I would like to have this research asap because our time table is very short.  Do you have any information on that?  Thanks.  Michelle Cash 
 I will look closely at the sample letters to see whether there is any way to avoid the conclusion you have reached, which appears to be the correct one. I have a meeting right now, and will focus on it right after that -- I'll send another email once I've completed that review early this afternoon. Michelle 
 Gracie,  Based upon my brief review of her comments, many are not acceptable.  Without a convincing explanation, I am not going to delete entire sections of our agreement, particularly when those sections protect Enron.  Please get with her (not by copy of this privileged email) and ask for reasons why she wants the changes.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dee, what do you think?  I suggest that we let them handle that, but defer to your opinion.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI, here is information relating to the voice mail I forwarded to you late Friday.  I will be on vacation the dates they want to handle diligence, so one of you may need to handle it.  Let's see what happens. . .  Michelle 
 fyi.  michelle 
 t:  Please print for me.  Thanks a lot! Michelle 
 Scott,  I would love to attend, except that I will be out of the office on vacation that whole week.  It sounds like a great presentation!  Would you mind if I forward it to some other folks in corporate legal who might be interested (i.e., my counterparts)?  Thanks.  Michelle    Enron North America Corp. 
 TWanda, I assume that you have these saved somewhere?  If not, would you? Thanks.  Michelle 
 Debi, I will prepare a draft response for you.  Michelle 
 Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can find an alternative.  Michelle 
 I agree with your approach.  MHC  PS, I am out next week on vacation.  Call Twanda to arrange for assistance while I am out, and she will refer you on.  Agreements will be done during my absence; again, work with Twanda.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Here is the note that went out.  I'm giving a speech this morning and will be out all afternoon, but I will try to catch you in between.  Also, I am in tomorrow, but then am out all next week on vacation.  While I am out, you can work with Emma Caplan.   Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are others who want to interview Carlos.  I tell you what -- before you schedule any of these, let me talk with Carlos first to see where his interests lie.  Keep these names, and I'll keep you posted on who to schedule with him.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Debi,  Your plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.  My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially since their "proven track record" is only for one placement.  It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption is not correct.  Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks for handling that!  We are looking forward to our trip.  I'll call you when we get in and let you know our details.  I look forward to seeing you, Mary Lou, and Peter, if available.  See you soon!  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice  Hoyt and Melissa,  I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not really familiar with the specific facts here.  The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.  If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers.  I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about 11 this morning, but am available after that.  Michelle 
 Bret,  I received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on Project Crane and have forwarded it to Rick Johnson, Fran Mayes, Pat Mackin, and Dee Lenfest.  We have preliminarily decided that Rick Johnson will go to both sites to cover Labor (union) issues and support in the general HR diligence that Fran Mayes of ENA HR will conduct.  Either Pat or Dee will travel to Washington to address benefits issues, including obtaining information for subsequent modeling of benefit costs.  We would like to have our outside counsel in Canada conduct the benefits diligence in the Quebec City location and to support Rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of Canadian or Quebec law.   I will continue to coordinate these activities and provide whatever other assistance may be needed.  Let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for employment/labor matters.  I will work with Peter Del Vecchio to identify our outside counsel designee.  Michelle 
 would you please print this and attachments and put a sticky note on them that it is for Anonymous Letters project -- so that I focus on it!  thanks. mhc 
 Debi,  I will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes from CS at this time.  I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time, but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed.  That way, we aren't making it an absolute ban.  Thanks for the information.  Michelle 
 I certainly agree with the concept.  It sounds like it gives us more flexibility. 
 Debi,  Your response should go as follows.  I suggest doing it in writing, rather than an email that could be manipulated.  If you have theri fax number, that probably would be best.  Also, I suggest that we ask CS not to identify us as a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity materials.  We prefer to keep our vendor list private.  Dear Ms. Poss,  Thank you for your written  request for a reference on Contracting Solutions.  It is not our practice to provide references for contracting agencies.  I would suggest that you contact another company that does business with Contracting Solutions to obtain the information you seek.  I am sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives.  By the way, I spoke with Jennifer Cronin, who had referred your call to me. She indicated that you had identified Contracting Solutions as the subject matter of your request.  Sincerely yours, Debi Vanwey 
 Hoyt,  I have reviewed the attached.  I think it looks good.  It strikes the balance of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the future.  Kriste, any other thoughts?  Michelle 
 Alan, he's out of town until Friday, so I will schedule early next week with you and Dan.  Others are interested as well, so we'll probably have a full interview schedule with him.  Thanks for the quick response.  Michelle 
 I have not prepared one and am not aware of one in place -- that is why I prefaced my comments with that.  Randy's email made it sound like there was one. Sorry I'm not more help on this.  Michelle 
 I'd suggest finding otu more information.  My inclination would be not to accept the contractor. 
 As you know, we have another power plant project -- if I haven't forwarded information to you yet, I will be doing so in the next day or so.  The schedule is for preliminary diligence to be completed by 9/8; data room is open 9/6.  Attached to the email I will be sending you is a list of the current information we have here -- lots of documents are here.  Please review the data list and forward to me which ones you want copied, and I will coordinate that process.  The stock purchase agreement draft will be circulated next week.  Michelle 
 Sure.  Dick is an outside consultant.  His name is Dick Jeanerette.  His number is 713-650-6535.  Thanks, and have fun in MA.  Michelle 
 FYI, it sounds like they now are organized about the process in New York. Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 David,  Hello, I hope all is well with you.  I was out last week on holiday and am just now getting back into the swing of things.  Alan and I have spoken about your contract, and I am getting in touch with the CU lawyers to work on an appropriate form for Australia.  I will be keep you apprised of the status.  Have a good weekend.  Michelle 
 Privileged and Confidential  Felicia,  Would you please run a disparate impact analysis for the proposed stock options to be granted within Enron Net Works?  I would like this data for the purpose of giving legal advice.  Thank you.  Michelle 
 Dear Mr. Catanzariti:  My name is Michelle Hoogendam Cash, Assistant General Counsel-Enron North America Corp.  I was referred to you by David Minns in the Enron Australia office. I am attaching a copy of our Employment Agreement Form for your review in light of Australian law.  Please review this form and provide me with any comments that you may have.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  If you have any questions, please give me a call at (713) 853-6401. 
 I agree.  Thanks for letting them know about my contact.  I emailed them the form, so we should be on our way!  Michelle 
 David, I did not receive the package in interoffice mail.  Could you email it to me or re-send it by fax at 646-3490?  Thanks!  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 Hoyt,  Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages in exchange for a release.  We need the title/position and the age of the persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as well as the persons who were not offered a package.  We will provide this data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Attached is an Agreement and Release Form that Michelle would like for you to review.  She is on the phone with you now regarding this attachment. 
 Brian,  Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.   I think he has a good idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.  Currently, it is done on an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.  Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?  It would be an excellent start.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Sheryl, sorry, I had the wrong email address.  Here is the resend.  Michelle 
 I hadn't heard about Alex's offer. That is great!!  He is such a nice guy. I'll send details on hen night later.  Michelle 
 please print this and attachment for me.  thanks.  mhc 
 Here are the latest!!!  Michelle 
 fyi re:  Lutz.  mhc 
 Rick,  It sounds like this may satisfy CURE, but I question whether this is an appropriate payment.  I would want to touch base with the lawyers working on the deal to find out if there are any implications.  Any other feedback? Michelle 
 Hoyt -- actually, we need only the New York office -- other locations should not be included.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks,  I'll be there.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  Crane.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  Crane 
 Hello, girls.  If Stacey can do it, so can I!  Here are the latest pictures of Cameron. These were taken right before the Baptism of my sister's third (can you believe it??) child, so he is all dressed up.  I hope all is well with everyone.  Love, Michelle 
 Andrea,  Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think?  Michelle 
 Hoyt, Here is a privileged and confidential legal memorandum regarding the Garden State modification of operations.  Let's discuss these issues tomorrow or Friday.  Michelle 
 Please see the note below, which was forwarded to me by Richard Sanders, on Triple Lutz.  Michelle 
 CPage:  Would you please forward this directly to Pat?  Pat, For your information, Chris Tomko has resigned from GSP.  GSP has hired a consultant, Hoyt Thomas (who has been working as an Enron HR consultant for a few weeks), to handle interim HR responsibilities until GSP hires a new HR person.  I suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling in the next few weeks as this transition occurs.  If you are available on Friday, I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt.   Would you please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-6401, to let her know your availability so that she can set up a conference call?  Thanks a lot.  Twanda, would you please set this up when Pat calls?  Michelle 
 great, Andrea, shall we discuss rollout asap?  Thanks!!  Michelle 
 Roberto,  These are good questions, and, in fact, are ones to which I am not certain of the answer (at least for #2).  Let's get together next week to discuss the specifics of how this program works and then determine the issues.  Twanda, would you please set up this meeting for me?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Bob, there also are legal issues to address, so I appreciate your keeping me in the loop as this evolves.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Molly, add her to the list for Carlos.  Also, could you find out who Bonnie Nelson has worked for in the past and provide me with that information so that we can call and make reference checks?  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 
 Chuck,  Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?  Given the correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.  Otherwise, even if we do "agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.  I am ready to hear what this guy has to say about my client.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Drew, You are right on.  I do have the concerns raised in your prior email, but I did not want to commit those to writing.  I have asked to be kept in the loop, and will provide that input as needed in a meeting setting. Thanks.  Michelle 
 Ginger, I cannot attend that meeting, as I am in another.  I will be out of the office the rest of the week, so check with Twanda Sweet, my assistant, for rescheduling options.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I also want to be included in this discussion, but I do not want to commit my thoughts to writing.  So, count me in.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Andrea,  I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity. However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of that meeting.  I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.  Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you think?  Michelle  PS, do we need to include Don in our group? 
 TWanda, please print for me, including attachments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 fyi.  mhc 
 I would suggest working through Sheila Knudsen and the Compensation Council to get this done Enron-wide.  Let me know if that isn't successful.  Thanks. Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 No, just hold on -- we're waiting for final settlement documents from Reliant, with the Ajello release.  Michelle 
 tweanda, please print this and save as a form.  Then, put the print out in the Merger, Acquisition, and Divestitures Notebook on myu credenza-- just stick it inside there.  Thanks.  MHc 
 no, hold all of them until I speak with him -- we've obviously got a lot of interest!  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Amy, this looks fine, except I would delete the provision about exceptions, because there really are none!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here are comments from Tom Moore regarding the proposed Services Agreement. I will circulate the draft SSD this week.  As always, I welcome additional feedback from the user groups.  Michelle 
 Gerry, this is too cryptic for me -- what was decided?  I'd like to go to the next meeting!  Thanks.  Michelle 
 David,  I will have this re-reviewed by Oregon counsel, but it was scrubbed about 18-24 months ago as being enforceable.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Bill, I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on Williams.  I hope that happened . . .   I would like to have a petition ready early next week.  It will be lawsuit only, not injunctive relief.  I believe Ajello will be finalized this week.  I sent our signed version to Reliant last week, and I hope to have it signed by Ajello soon.  Once that happens, we can dismiss.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate.  "Met" expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in Satisfactory.  Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would be more accurate.  Where are we on the total revamp?  Has that been postponed until next year?  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Davie --  Meets many, but may have some developmen needs works just fine.  I just don't want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets requirements when, in fact, there are developmental needs that are obvious when compared to persons in strong.  So, I am happy with your proposal (although I suggest that your second proposal does not meet the "fairly up" goal).  Cheers.  Mich 
 I have sent a mark-up of this to Dave.  Let's talk tomorrow around 10:00. Michelle     Fran L Mayes 10/09/2000 01:48 PM 
 FYI -- Michelle 
 Here are the schedules.  MHC 
 Alice, for the employee we discussed last week, here is information on payee.  It doesn't look good.  Michelle 
 Hector/Valeria,  Do we have a rule against heaters?  If not, that seems to be the easiest solution, as well as the "dress warm" advice.  I think that moving him would not be good -- his isolation could work against our goals here.  Your thoughts?  Michelle 
 thanks, I look forward to your thoughts and comments.  michelle 
 Steve, I hope that I did not educate her too well . . . It was great to see you, and be sure to let me know if you can use my help in the future. Michelle 
 Kay, I will be out attending a seminar -- but, don't hold it up for me. Thanks!  Michelle 
 All is fine -- no disparate impact in the selection.  But, I still would like to see data about why certain persons were selected.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Cathy, what do we want to do with regard to Paskoff?  Remember, we were waiting until this week to respond to his requests for additional consideration?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Cathy,  Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as well as their title and age.  Please make sure that happens, or our waivers will not be valid.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Also, I never heard back from Ilya's lawyer.  Did he sign?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Jim,  FYI.  The second link here is about workers' comp insurance in California.  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please schedule a meeting with me, Hector, Sheila W., and Brian Schaffer re:  follow up to the Bashen information?  I would like to have this group discuss how to close the loop with Sally's employees and implement any recommendations for follow-up. I think the meeting with last approximately 1 1/2 hours.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I'll interview.  I'm available between 10-12 on Thursday.  Let me know when and where.  Michelle 
 Please print this and save it to my document list.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I agree with your assessment.  Thanks.  michelle 
 I suggest contacting Peggy Banzak for a contact in Mexico.  Michelle     Fran L Mayes 10/17/2000 12:28 PM 
 Pursuant to your request, attached is a draft letter to WiseSoft, Inc. regarding Hennadiy Batrak. 
 Anne,  I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.  From my perspective, it generally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.  In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds $250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of Section 4.13(iii).  Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.  In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any employment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.  In Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.  In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind to customers.  I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and provide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of Ethics may work here.  In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, or does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to "cash" payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock options/restricted stock that vest over time.  In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting -- Pat, do you know?  Should Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee Matters Agreement.  Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the purposes of dispute resolution?  Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions.  Michelle 
 Pat,  I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate email.  I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.  In terms of timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Here is a set of comments by Pat Mackin on the Triple Lutz agreement.  Cynthia/Mary, do you have anything to add?  Michelle 
 please excuse the delay on this --  If possible, I would like the following documents copied from the data room:  Leaf River:  Tab No.'s 20, 119-140, 146, and 168-170  Woodland:  Tab No.'s 107-130, and 136  Brunswick:  Tab No.'s 102-127, and 137  Thanks.  Michelle Cash 
 One other item:  Could you please request all employment contracts and change of control agreements, if any?  Thank you.  Michelle 
 Karen, does  Sean have his art on a web site anywhere?  I have someone who wants to look at it.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 Andrea, This looks good.  I have two nits:  First, the street value of our phone book is $1k, not $1. Also, "loosing" people should be "losing" people.  One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no filter on what employees can/can't put.  In other words, if an employee is working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.  One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron facility -- not remotely.  This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.  Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here is the attachment.  Thanks for the update on Delainey.  Michelle 
 REMINDER:   This email is to remind you that a meeting is scheduled for Monday, October 23rd from 4:00-5:00 regarding visa issues in EB38C2. 
 Attached is a draft from Michelle Cash. 
 fyi.  Michelle 
 Hector, we need to check with Kriste Sullivan on this.  I have a vague recollection about a group of employees going to Dynegy, and we had to send a demand letter to prohibit the improper use of Enron information.  She was involved, so could you please send her the email you sent to me?  Then, we can discuss a strategy.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 David,  I believe the agreement was signed.  It would have been a Corporate Services Agreement.  I believe that Shonnie Daniel or Steve Van Hooser worked on this.  I have cc'd this email to them so that they can provide you with a copy, forward it on to the appropriate person, or let me know if one never was signed, in which case I can prepare a new version.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 Here is the latest.  Michelle 
 FYI, particularly the part about the performance management system.  Let's see what kind of data we can get about the Microsoft evaluation system to find the differences.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Would you let me know which you choose?  I may need some of them as a backup!  Michelle 
 Twanda, please take the text of this email and turn it into a document that is presentable so that I can give it to Mark at our Quarterly Business Review Meeting at 2:00 Monday -- actually, I will need it by noon so that I can revise it.  Thanks.  Michelle    Transactions  Major Events of September - November 2000  Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.  Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees (including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.  Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.  Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.  E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.   Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.  East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.  Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.   Litigation  Major Events of September - November 2000  No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.  Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.  Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered mediation to follow.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.    Documents Generated  Major Events of September - November 2000  New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  Standard Agreements:  I prepared:  ___ draft employment agreements.  ___ draft consulting services agreements.  ___ separation agreement and releases.  ___ retention letter agreements.  The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our non-compete provisions.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus pool.  Investigations  Major Events of September - November 2000  Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]  Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation results led to termination of employment for cause.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated following PRC/bonus discussions.   Training  Major Events of September - November 2000  Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went through the first round.  Pre-Hire Testing  Major Events of September - November 2000  Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests will result in a successful employee.  Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under Beth Perlman.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A program.   Employee Relations/Terminations  Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination issues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, and they require significant time.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on a performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are put in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely (probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming and full of risks.  Work for Portfolio Assets  Major Events of September - November 2000  Ecogas:  wind-down issues.  Mariner:  Change of Control Agreements.  CGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to provide training for CGAS personnel.  East Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  CGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.  Mariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.   Conclusions   ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of manager or above.  Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).  Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000. I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it may improve over time.  Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if contractors are allowed to stay on too long.  Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many employees in the "exempt" category who should be classified as "non-exempt." I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will not be an easy fix.  EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle the job.  EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to shorten the non-compete duration for this group. 
 For your information.  Michelle 
 I have a copy of the signed Employee Services Agreement between Bridgeline and ENA.  Would you like a copy of it?  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 Sure, I'll send letters.  The one for Paskoff will go out today.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Amy, this is way late, so sorry.  I suggest running it by the HR leadership team.  The email list can be obtained from Gerry Gibson at corp.  If there are HR openings, and she would be interested, they would most probably be the best people to assess her skills.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Nathan, Ted Bland is the Enron wholesale person responsible for all recruiting for one of the business units I support.  I actually spoke with Ted today about you.  He is working on scheduling you for a meeting, but he has had some difficulty in finalizing schedules.  So, there is no need to follow up, because he will get with you in a few days.  Hope all is well.  Michelle 
 please print this and attachments.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Craig, I spoke with Fran Mayes about being the HR person for the Leaf River site visit, and she is planning to go.  Michelle 
 Anne,  Would you please re-send me the Employee Matters Agreement for Lutz?  I have deleted my electronic copy and need to send it on to the HR people. Thanks.  Michelle 
 My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline deal.  In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the Bridgeline entity.  It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the employees are sent there via an assignment letter.   (Pat, you may recall that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have given you the transaction name at the time).  So, currently, all Enron personnel assigned to Bridgeline actually are Enron employees.  I am not aware of any change to that structure.  Fran, do you know of any changes?  Are we now going to transfer all of those employees to the Bridgeline entity?  Those answers would help.  Michelle 
 Attached is a revised draft of your Employment Agreement.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. 
 Andrea, would it be possible to update our list to show the current progress on the "30 days" items?  I think you have a better handle on the timelines than I would.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Cathy,  Do we have an answer on Cirino?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Marty,  Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment.  As we discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency.  So, I told her to call you.  The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson.  His number is 713-652-4748.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I am not at all surprised!!!!  Michelle 
 Marty/Tim,  Here is pricing information about harassment prevention training.  Feel free to call Kerry directly about his availability.  Michelle 
 Yes, thanks.  I was aware of that joyous news.  I am going to see if I can get a copy of the petition to review all the allegations in detail.  Thanks. Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 How about this:  Any future grant/payment described on this worksheet is subject to appropriate committee approvals and previously-defined performance standards; the use of the term "guaranteed" on this worksheet does not modify the terms and conditions of any such payment/grant.  Too wordy?  Michelle 
 please save as a form and print for me.  I'll revise then.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat,  Hello!  I am sending to you a memo from Stuart Zisman here at Enron.  He has a question that I am forwarding to you, since I don't know the answer.  Would you please give him an answer today, if possible?  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Fran, I think we should get together tomorrow to discuss the issues around this deal.  Could you get with Twanda to do that?  THanks.  MIchelle     Fran L Mayes 10/30/2000 08:58 AM 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 Dave,  I left you a voice mail that I am available to assist in this process at your convenience.  Let me know how you want to proceed.  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 Finley,  Can we schedule a conference call with the HR folks at Celgar?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Sorry about the earlier email!  The following contains a summary of  high-level employment/labor issues based upon the review of the documents in the data room here in Houston.  We still need to have a conference call with the HR team at GP to ascertain the climate of labor relations and other employment issues.  Woodland  1.  Employment Claims:  In the list of insurance matters, there are several employment-related claims.  Those include sexual harassment allegations, disability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.  It is unclear whether those are ongoing claims or not.  I would question whether the mill has had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.  Also, are there other employment claims that are not identified in the documents?  2. Labor Union matters:  Rick Johnson is going to review the collective bargaining agreements.   I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is supposed to be forwarded to me today.  3.  I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements, or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing for either Woodland.  Leaf River  1.  Litigation Summary:  The company provided a summary of litigation.  Three of the four are personal injury claims -- one is a fall down stairs by a delivery person (settled on 7/14/00); another is a contract employee who was injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled 7/27/00).  The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 1991, which has been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.  The summary states that the corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims. We may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this transaction.  Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?  (E.g., EEOC).  2.  No employment contracts.  I saw nothing about change of control agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide post-closing payments.  3.  Workers Comp:  There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 1998. I would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make sure that they are not unusual.  Dee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should provide a separate analysis on that topic.  Michelle 
 Laura, do you need any more information from me on this point?  Michelle 
 Should that be 2 months or 3 months?  we haven't done less than three, and I don't think it is a good idea to go below that.  MHC 
 Felicia,  Does this sound right to you?  Just wanted to confirm.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Pat, thanks for your comments.  I agree 100%.  Michelle  PS.  My friend who is a photographer is doing a show in Dallas this week.  I suspect that we'll see info on his web site pretty soon. 
 Tim, I just got your letter about  the January trial setting.  When did we learn of that setting?  How do we accomplish the goal of keeping our business people free from depositions at year-end?  Can that be done?  Michelle 
 Dee, could you please forward to Steve Van Hooser our usual checklist on employee matters for diligence purposes?  That would be helpful.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Anne,  I got you an invitation to the Preview Party for Wednesday!  Eden Sholeen is going to call you with the details.  Michelle 
 fyi. 
 fyi 
 I haven't heard anything from Alice yet.  MHC 
 Felicia,  This is a merchant asset, which we currently own 100%, but plan to sell down in the coming months.  It absolutely has separate HR functions from Enron -- they do not participate in Enron benefits, and we are working hard to prevent any claims that we could be a joint employer with it.  Thoughts?  Michelle    Enron North America Corp. 
 Kathy, I think we should do some sort of an assignment agreement.  It does not have to be as long and involved as our current ones, but we should paper it up.  Michelle 
 Cheryl,  I am taking 12/1 off as a vacation day -- so, let's play!!!  I have a hair appointment Saturday, which I cannot really change this late in the year. So, do you want to get a haircut, manicure, or anything else beautifying while you are here?  If so, I'll book something for you.  There is no way we would have you babysit.  In fact, we have a  sitter for Saturday night. so we can go somewhere fun for dinner and maybe even see a movie or do anything else you may want to do.  I can't wait for your visit!!  Michelle 
 Dear Gerald,  I received and reviewed your email, and I will check with my clients on your proposal.  I expect that I will have an answer later this week.  I understand that my assistant has sent you the documents by email.   Let me know if you did not receive them.  Feel free to give me a call to discuss.  Michelle Cash 
 Cindy, Tim, Marly, Pam, and Neil --  I will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this weekend.  How about 6:30 am on Saturday?  After that, you can schedule it at your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks.  I am prepared for you ; I bought Tide, Downey, and Bounce, as well as spray starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- don't worry, I only have 5-6 full-sized tablecloths and about 15 of Trey's shirts to be ironed.  That shouldn't take too long.  See you then.  Michelle 
 Go ahead and file it.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 On lunch, I've asked Twanda to reschedule.  thanks.  mhc 
 for your entertainment.  mhc 
 Hector,  I met with David Baumbaugh today about Bridgeline.  Apparently, we have sent Trey Logan over there to replace O'Neal Winfree.  We thus need to do an assignment letter for Logan.  Could you please provide me and Twanda with the particulars so that we can paper it up?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Here is the latest piece of information.  Michelle 
 Looks good to me. MHC 
 Yes, we will reword it.  In fact, we are looking at a review of the entire application.  Michelle 
 Any interest in either of these candidates?  They are presented by a headhunter.  Let me know.  Michelle 
 Janie,  Has Peggy been hired yet?  If not, would you please forward me her resume again?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Fran, any word from Nancy?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Bill, I'll be in tomorrow; let's discuss this matter.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 For AMPS:  Here are the HR questions for diligence.  Michelle 
 Hector -- we do not know the details of how this will work.  It has not been finally decided.  I would suggest that we remain vague about the whole thing until the deal, if it happens, is signed.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 You should have it.  I sent it yesterday.  Michelle  Twanda, could you confirm?  Thanks.  MHC       Carol Coats 11/15/2000 05:18 PM 
 fyi.  Does this give you enough information?  MHC 
 What about payrolling through an agency so that he is on a contract-to-hire basis?  That way, we can say that the intent is to hire, but that we are evaluating the situation before making a regular, full-time offer.  Customers understand contract-to-hire concept, so it may not raise "lack of commitment" jitters.  What do you think?  Michelle 
 Dan, here is info on AMPS.  Some of these points should be included in deal documents.  Michelle 
 Dorie,  I think this looks good.  I have two tweaks:  On the "Let me be clear" sentence, I'd delete the "let me be clear" introduction.  I think the last sentence speaks for itself. In the last sentence, why not conclude by saying that if they don't pay, "we will have no choice but to take further action on this matter" and delete the reference to attorneys.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, it is good to go.  Good luck!  Michelle 
 This is great!!!!  Can you believe all that is going on in Sunny Florida?  I called Nat/Laura to get their take on the mayhem, but I haven't been able to talk with them.  I got a voice mail from Laura that Jesse Jackson was leading a demonstration up the street from their house!  They are right in the thick of it.  Later.  MHC 
 I thought you might get a kick out of this.  Michelle 
 I'll call you tomorrow.  Michelle 
 I'll take care of it today.  Michelle 
 Tim,  Do you think these depositions will take a day apiece?  Or, can we schedule more than one in a day?  Let me know, so that I can arrange schedules.  Thanks for the update!  Good work.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  California law.  Michelle 
 Hoyt,  If GSP LLC  would assume the liability at the time of return, why would it risk bringing them back for light duty work?  Why not wait until they are fully released, particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers comp scheme?  Also, Hoyt, you need to be careful about revealing conversations with GSP counsel to MG -- I noticed you had cc'd someone from Media General in the prior email.  We don't want to waive any privileges.  Michelle 
 Trey,  The following items are on my Christmas list:  1.  Boggle game 2.  Joe Jackson CD:  Night & Day II 3.  Pottery Barn Large Organizer:  Catalogue number 48-2806305 ($69) 4.  Monnogrammed Travel Alarm Clock (Pottery Barn)  Catalogue # 10-2811784 ($30) 5.  Monogrammed Business Card Holder (Pottery Barn) Item # 12-33756186 ($30) 6.  Hermes or Hermes-type scarf 7.  Wood picture frames -- painted black is ok -- for 5x7 prints 8.  Drink coasters  Let me know if you have any questions or want more specific information.  Michelle 
 More re  Canary 
 Attached is the resume of Dominic Carolan, who currently is working at Global E&P.  He is looking to move elsewhere within Enron, given that the assets in Global E&P are going to be sold.  I understand that you are looking for a lawyer with oil and gas experience. He might be a good candidate.  I met him today, and he is pleasant and professional.  If you are interested in interviewing him, let me know, and I will get it scheduled.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Julia,  On Garden State matters, how do you want to handle the signing of documents? Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and initialling them before signature.  Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may be a desire to have a more expeditious process.  I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department is going to be involved in GSP work.  Given our discussion last week, I would not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the standard Enron process, but it is not my call.  I would appreciate your thoughts.  Michelle 
 Felicia, I am going to take a vacation day on Friday.  How about Thursday or Monday?  Twanda, ignore my earlier email.  Michelle 
 more . . .  I've forwarded this issue to Dee.  MHC 
 FYI re:  outside counsel in B.C. who are handling diligence.  I spoke with Dean today, and he appeared to be asking all the right questions.  MHC 
 Pursuant to Michelle's request, please review the attached form and provide her with your comments.  Thanks. Twanda  This is a mail merge document, so you will need to click on option and delete header source.  Also, I spoke with Michelle the other person to invite is Barbara Gray. 
 Molly, could you please forward the "thanks, but no  thanks" template letter to me?  I will send it to her since she interviewed.  For persons who don't interview,  I think the "no thanks" letter can come from HR.  Thanks for your assistance on this.  Michelle 
 I wasn't sure you'd know who sent it, but good guess!  Trey was quite pleased with himself.  Later.  Michelle 
 Elizabeth, any interest in the second resume here?  We are interviewing the first guy already.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 please print this plus attachments and file in Garden State file.  Thanks. MHC 
 sounds fabulous!!!  See you Friday -- is a place/time confirmed yet? 
 Dianne,  Thanks for all your work for the Travel Club.  I never make a meeting, but really enjoy the tickets, etc.  One question I have is whether Enron has any special relationships with Disney.  Are we a corporate client of Disney?  My old law firm had some sort of relationship with Disney that let us get great deals, early entry into the parks, etc., so it may be worth looking into.  Thanks again.  Michelle Cash 
 please print this and attached and put in the Project Canary Due Diligence file.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 thanks for organizing this!  It was a blast.  See you Sunday.  Michelle

 FYI.  Michelle 
 Eden, Here is the data for the Ecogas settlement agreements.  Michelle 
 maybe.  He was in today and met with Mark Taylor, Travis, and Lance, to positive results.  I certainly could ask him if he's interested in trading. Leslie Hansen thinks highly of him.  Michelle 
 go ahead and initial it.  I assume that there are no changes.

 Sharon/Kriste,  If there are going to be revisions to the leave policy, I suggest that we make major ones, including a segregation of FMLA leave from other types of leave --i.e., two separate policies.  Let's talk about this on Tuesday ----- Majorly important!!  Michelle 
 Privileged & Confidential  David,  As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment agreement.  I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement.  I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment (salary, options, etc.).  Let me know if you would like any other information from me.  Michelle 
 Attached are some notes from Michelle Cash. 
 David,  As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and other litigation matters.  We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.  The terms of that Agreement would include:  1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters.  He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as needed.  2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement).  After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.  3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his employment with Enron.  Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following:  -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA, -- Kevin's intentional acts, -- Kevin's gross negligence, -- Kevin's reckless conduct, -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other legal obligation, or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.  4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01.  The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.  In addition, all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of  the agreement.  Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.  I am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to attend.  Michelle 
 Gene and Susan,  Here is the draft award agreement for the plan.  Let me know if you have comments.  I will be getting with Brian Bloom this week with our comments to the plan document.  Michelle 
 Thanks for the draft.  Delaware is the proper state.  I thought the deferral information was sent to you already.   There is no "plan" document per se.  Instead, there is a description of the program.  I will re-send that to you today if you don't already have it.  Please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, for a time to have a conference call on the other question.  My morning today is wild; tomorrow probably is better.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Tony, the lawyer's name is Gary Herrmanns at Orrick.  His number is 415-773-5451.  Thanks for the message about Trey!  Michelle 
 Just when you thought it was safe . . .  I have received a question from NEPCO about Project 50.  Apparently, they have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company. These are hourly employees who do not work regularly.  Originally, these employees were thought to be included in the scope of Project 50 by corp. Mike Indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 50 options because they are not "regular, full-time or regular part-time employees" as described in the memo from the Office of the Chairman.  What are  your thoughts on that?  Should they be included or not? My reading of the email to all employees is that it does not include temporary employees.  Do you know how other temporary employees were treated?  Let me know what you think.  Thanks, as always.  Michelle 
 Tara,  You are right -- those changes were not included.  For Vice President level employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses.  The request that he be able to "get out" of his employment contract if he is not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board.  I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that these changes could not be made.  Michelle 
 Hello!  An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary information, however.  What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.  I welcome your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.  Thanks for your thoughts.  Michelle 
 fyi 
 FYI re:  FMLA policy 
 Please keep your file open.  We still are talking with her, and probably will need additional revisions to the document, as well as your advice and counsel.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Felicia,  In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.  My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not be an issue.  Let me know if you have questions.  Michelle 
 TWanda, please print for me.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI.  Michelle

 FYI.  Michelle 
 David, on point 2, that type of arrangement has to be approved by the Enron Executive Committee.  Let me know if you want a copy of the note describing that process, which was sent by Cindy Olson a few weeks ago.    Michelle 
 Sure, Twanda, would you please forward? Thanks!  Michelle 
 We are in the process of promulgating a data protection policy.  It should be out  in the next few weeks.  It addresses all of those privacy, etc. issues. Let me know if you would like a copy of the draft policy.  MIchelle    Enron North America Corp. 
 We should get it today;  I'll messenger it over when it arrives.  mhc 
 FYI.  I have sent them a copy of the draft policy.  I think it will address their concerns.  Michelle 
 Cindy,  FYI regarding the labor/employment lawyer for EBS -- according to Sharon, she was asked to be point person for EBS.  I'll let you know when I talk with Mark, which should be early next week upon his return from London.  Have a great weekend!  Is Chelsea giving you a mother's day gift?  Michelle 
 Please print for me .  Thanks. MHC 
 Linda, great job!!!!  I am happy with that result.  It makes things much easier.  Have a great weekend.  Michelle     "Linda Broocks" <lbroocks@ogwb.com> 05/12/2000 10:17 AM Please respond to lbroocks 
 John,  Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice mail and was glad to be in the loop.  In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)?  As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed.  Michelle     John Viverito@ENRON 05/11/2000 02:44 PM 
 Very good response!!!  It struck the right chord, I thought.  MHC 
 Twanda, we need executables.  Michelle 
 Enclosed is another draft of the proposed Agreement and Release.  It has incorporated some, but not all, of your changes.  It is my hope that this draft is the final one; if it is not, I believe that it would be most efficient for you to meet with me and David Oxley before the end of this week, as I will be out of the office next week.  Please let me or David know if you have any questions or comments. 
 Thanks.  I frequently pick up my first job after I complete my second shift at home.  That's why I got the nifty flat screen for my computer -- jealous??  Michelle 
 Thank you!!  Michelle 
 Trey, I want to go . . .  I wonder if that is possible.  Let's talk about it.  M    Trey Cash@ENRON 06/05/2000 12:14 PM 
 Kerry, this is the second of two messages.   Do you have any thoughts? Michelle     Michelle  - Can you review the following examples as well?  USO means unscheduled overtime, UPG means upgrade and the UO1 means Upgrade Overtime. If I should be forwarding these to someone else, please let me know.  Thanks, Diane 
 David/Diane,  I am with you.  In fact, I sent these questions to outside counsel early this week because I simply have not had time to focus on them given everything else that is going on.  I expect an answer by early next week -- I hope Monday.  Sorry about not letting you know where this was . . . .  Michelle     David O'Dell@ENRON 06/09/2000 09:46 AM 
 Kim, Have you asked Brian to review it as well?  I think his input would be valuable.  Michelle     Kimberly Rizzi 06/09/2000 02:37 PM 
 T:  Please print these for me.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Mr. Mackin, Michelle Cash has asked me to forward the language below to you for your comments.  Please review and email Michelle your comments to this paragraph.  Thanks Twanda  Subject to the above, at a Committee meeting after this Agreement is signed, Employee shall receive a second grant of Enron Corp. Common Stock options with a value of $175,000.00 (the number of stock options shall be determined by the Committee, which will use the Enron-approved Black-Scholes valuation). The second grant is intended to reimburse Employee for value Employee lost upon leaving his prior job.  The vesting schedule for these options will be described in the grant agreement, which shall govern.

 Scott, would you be available in the next couple of weeks to meet with me and some of the HR reps regarding follow-up for employees who leave the company? I would like us to be proactive in those situations.  Let me know your availability.  Thanks.  Michelle x36401.

 Pat,  Given that the new AESOP has been approved by the comp. committee, do you think the language attached below should be revised?  (Or, should I ask -- has it been revised?).

 Pat, thanks for the revisions to the AESOP language.  I have another one for you.  The attached is a proposed retention program for persons in HR who may be facing outsourcing.  There is a need to incentivize these key personnel to stick around now and, if there is an outsourcing, to help with the transition.  Your comments/thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks.

If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, "Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."  The effective date still can be 6/1.

 Privileged and Confidential -- Advice Covered by the Attorney-Client Privilege  K2:  I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME region.  My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high. Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Matt,  Thanks for your email.  I believe that there is an agreement in place between ENA and Enron Expat Services.  In general, the contract is between ENA and the employee, if the person is an expat.  The assignment letter covers the employee's transfer to Expat Services.  We haven't usually amended/assigned the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are through ENA.  If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, and I am happy to handle it.  If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.  I hope this answers your questions.  I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several years.  If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions.  Thanks a lot.

 Hello!  Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.  As I mentioned to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.  Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the unionized employees.   I'll provide details as I learn them.  I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dee/Pat/Rick:  Here is the diligence memo.  Michelle 
 Pat,  Thanks for your comments on the agreement.  As an FYI, the stock awards already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to address that situation.  I appreciate your other thoughts.  Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an example as suggested by Pat?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I agree with Brian.  I recently learned that someone can "hack" into the emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, this morning).  So, we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system.  I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor.  I agree with Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the chairman and not the content of the email itself.  I am happy to assist in any way you would like.  Michelle 
 Dick, Here are the details about the GPG PRC meeting.  Please note that these people have not been involved in the process for very long and thus, this may not be the best example of how the process works.  Nonetheless, it should give you a flavor of how it works.  When you get to the Enron Building, please ask for me or my assistant, Twanda Sweet, and one of us will take you to the conference room.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Peter, here are preliminary comments from Pat Mackin on the PSA.  Michelle 
 Attached is a draft memo regarding the above-referenced. 
 Hoyt, I suggest that we get Aaron Brown and Sheila Knudsen working on the issue of deferred comp. to work with Dee on this comparison.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Patrick, do you have any comments to this?  Michelle 
 Attached is a one-page outline summarizing the issues relating to Jim Ajell= o,=20 who recently left ENA to work for Reliant Energy.  By hard copy, I am sending you the following:  (1) a copy of the lawsuit EN= A=20 filed against Ajello, and (2) a copy of Ajello=01,s Employment Agreement, w= hich=20 is highlighted for your convenience.  If you have any questions or require additional information, please call me= =20 at (713) 853-6401. 
 Gina,  Have we figured out what happened here?  I haven't heard anything in a while.  Michelle 
 Andrea,  You are right.  I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who was setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not intentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings.  I am sorry about this one.  Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a compensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp, promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people lots of heartburn.  To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating.  For example, a "strong" performer really could be excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third category.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old "HR" language.  For example, a category 1 performer would have a descriptor that said something like:  "Always raises the bar; franchise player," etc. rather than a "HR" definition relating to demonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference between the two.  There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC appeared to be a "black box," and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process.  This was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Michelle 
 I think that gathering this information at interview makes the most sense. Obviously, new hire orientation is too late!  I prefer an original, signed document, but a fax is an ok substitute, provided that the applicant mails us the originals after faxing.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Gina, I will leave this to your discretion.  I agree that the OD&T people could help us in the communication/training side of any changes that are made.  Comp. probably will not be affected much, since Needs Improvement and Issues both are no bonus/no merit categories.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, thanks for the update.  By the way, did you talk with  Fran Mayes, who went to the management presentations last week?  She may have some of the missing information.  Dee, you might want to check with her for data. Thanks.  Michelle 
 Mary, yes, it merely is a form issue.  Sharon and Kriste have consolidated those paragraphs in their form.  I will follow suit in mine to minimize confusion and to keep the "one template" concept intact.  Michelle 
 Mark,  The pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that people are being paid equitably.  Given that the company has until November of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue, it should be no big deal -- unless there currently are pay inequities.  A list of persons in each job, with salary and gender, could allow us to determine whether an issue even exists.  Michelle 
 Sharon, Kriste, and I discussed this, and agreed that simple was better.  We also thought that a reference to the Enron Employee Data Protection Policy and the Code of Ethics provisions on data should be referenced, with a link, if possible.  Thanks. Michelle 
 Mary, I won't be able to call her until next week because I'm going to be out/tied up the rest of this week.  I am fine if you want to call her.  My only caution would be that you give her data only about our structure -- not why we set it up the way we did or anything else that would be privileged and confidential.  The structure itself would not be privileged -- only our strategies and basis for setting it up that way would be.  If you don't mind a delay in the return call, I'll do it next week.  Just let me know. Thanks.  Michelle 
 please print for me as well as attachemnts.  thanks. mhc 
 Attached is a draft of the Agreement for Recruiting or Contract Personnel Services.  This draft combines the Master Services Agreement, the Agreement for Project Services, and the Staffing Services Agreement into a single, comprehensive document.  Attached to this, as applicable, will be a Project Work Description ("PWD") and/or a Staffing Services Description ("SSD").  I understand that HR is working on a revised PWD.  I will circulate the SSD in the near future.  It will contain a more specific description of staffing services (e.g. retained/contingency) as well as pay rates.  Please review this draft to determine if it fits your needs.  Feel free to throw darts!  Let me know by return email if you have comments or questions. I will resolve as many as possible based upon your comments as well as those of others in Legal, and circulate a revised draft based upon those comments.  Thank you. 
 Kay, 10/10 works for me at 4:00.  If that date doesn't work, would you please include my assistant, Twanda Sweet, on the distribution, given that I will be out at the law conference for the rest of the day and tomorrow?  Thanks. Michelle 
 I'm here til 3:30, when meetings begin. . .  thanks!  mhc     Enron North America Corp.

 please calendar for me.  Thanks!!  You also should attend if you are interested.  Michelle 
 Cathy, let's talk about the outstanding issues on Monday so that we can wrap these up.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 Dave,  Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 No, I have not sent any information.  I doubt that Hoyt has, either.  You send them the information before they sign.  I would just do a cover memo and references the agreement, where there is a specific provision about receipt of information. Thanks.  MHC     Enron North America Corp. 
 What about Paskoff?  His lawyer is calling me.  Michelle     Enron North America Corp. 
 sounds fine to me.  Michelle 
 those look good.  Has Sheng already signed?  Let me know.  Also, we need an answer on Paskoff; his lawyer called again.  Thanks.  MHC     Enron North America Corp. 
 Dave, why don't you send it to Steve for review.  The consultant doing the training will be working from this.  When do we want to set up the training?  Our lawyers are ready to go.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Drew,  Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who has had some issues.  I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his agreement.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you fax it to my house first thing in the morning?  713-218-7355 is the fax number.  If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I will prepare on this topic.  I am going to be attending a seminar out of the office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.  I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and Louise for comment and dart-throwing.  I can be reached via my cell phone during the day at 713-302-5522.  Thanks, Drew.  Michelle 
 Drew, thanks, I got it.  I'll be sending out an email on this in the next couple of hours.  I'll send it to you and Robert first.  You can run it by Chapman and/or outside counsel in London today. If everyone is in agreement as to the approach, we can send it to Louise asap.  More to come . . . . Michelle 
 Dee,  I assume that you will go through these documents for benefits/plan issues and then send relevant ones to Pat this week.  If that is not your plan, let me know.  Thanks!  Michelle 
 More info about Bond.  Michelle 
 Here is the agreement for Lutz.  Michelle 
 David,  I am in agreement with you on this.  This week, we lost an agreement that had options to be granted.  It did not make it to the Administrative Committee until 2 months after signing, and only because the employee came forward and asked about her grant.  Luckily for us, the strike price was better/lower. If it had been the other way around, we may have had a much bigger issue.  Michelle 
 Thanks.  What about the COBRA amounts?  Are they correct?  I will be glad to close this one out, too!  Michelle    Enron North America Corp. 
 hi, Trang,  I would like to have a little more information about this.  Who is she sending emails to?  When were they sent?  Have all the bills been paid?  etc.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy. 
 Pat,  Here is the latest PSA draft for a  We've agreed to pay $1mm of the severance.  We also have agreed to pay the cost of 2000 bonuses.  On options, there is a proposal for Enron to supervest the employees' options at closing -- can we agree to that? I didn't think so.  your comments would be appreciated.  Michelle 
 David,  The "gardening leave provision would apply beyond the term.  I will make your tweak to 3.4.  I checked the 12-months with Clayton Utz, and they thought it was ok.  I'll forward a new draft in the next day or so.  Hope you had a good trip back.  MIchelle

 David,  The document you gave me is the form assignment letter that I have prepared for many Bridgeline personnel.  Do we need to do anything to tweak it?  How do you want me to proceed?  Thanks.  Michelle     Enron Capital Management 
 please save, run spell check, and print for my review.  I think that Robert Jones or Oxley will have to sign it instead of me, since I am not an officer.  Thanks.  MHCC

 Sheila,  HR is setting up interviews with Carlos next week, and you will be on the interviewer list.  Thanks!  How would you like references run on Bonnie?  Internally or pre-Enron.

 Jeff, Good luck with the EES rotation.  I would like to clarify one thing: at this point, I don't know for sure if we are having law students work with us during the summer.  Why don't you check with me in April or May to see whether we are hiring summer associates.  If so, you are welcome to go through the interview process.  Thanks.

 Hello, everyone.  Please let me know which of these dates works best for you.  It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for both preparation and the deposition itself.  That way, I can find overlapping dates on which you all are available.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle
