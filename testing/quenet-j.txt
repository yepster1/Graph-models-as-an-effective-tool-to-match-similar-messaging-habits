 EOL is permanent..............it's in your DNA..................can't be undone.......... 
 Backstreet boy's suck..................................I'm very disapointed with you............make sure you don't mention you music tastes when we go riding the "hogs"... 
 vegas is out,....................take a look at montessori.........................i really think i could move all our stuff in one trip ( by myself too!)..........on those days that you work from home i would have  drop him off downtown........................you go woman! 
 you hurt my feelings ........................first , I'm  definetly the largest user of outside brokers in this entire firm........could possibly do more than anyone in  this market......30-40 "outside " trades each day.........second, in this instance he showed me a .25 bid and I hit it, then i offered evens( sold several hundred) then i wacked the 75's (again several hundred) then hit all the 50's......               when i come back to them and ask who I hit they say they have a problem......that it should have been an offer...when they listened to the tape they "think" he said "sell".......myself, I did nothing wrong in this.....then they come back with another name who will stand in at "even"....... well, make him come upto >25 and send him the check...........I (we) assume all the risk in the broker market............brokers collect the commission and have no position........we use brokers , pay the commission and also end up with a bad position from "flake" trades..........  didn't mean to vent on you .............using brokers carries risk(execution risk)....... 
 I've had fried turkey before, it's actually pretty good, however my wife and I are going for the more traditional feast........we have company coming down to visit us in our little apt.........going to be packed in..........things could be worse.......it's 60-65 degrees here for thanksgiving and even jan/ feb only gets down to 50-60 on average......  ok now that I'm calmed down, I feel much better.........you know how it is .........................there's no pressure in these job's !.
