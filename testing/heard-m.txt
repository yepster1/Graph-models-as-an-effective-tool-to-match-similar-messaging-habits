 Mr. Lopez-Velarde:  Pursuant to our conversation attached is the form of guaranty that one of our business groups would like to send to a Mexican counterparty.  Francisco has asked if you would please revise the guaranty to provide for agent for service of process, submission to governing law in Texas and submission to jurisdiction in U.S. courts in Texas.  It appears that the form includes submission to jurisdiction in Texas and I have included a provision regarding agent for service of process.  As I stated, we would like to have these revisions as soon as possible this afternoon.  Thank you for your assistance.  Marie  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp.

 Hi, Jay!  Just received a call from Adam at XTO Energy and he is going to be sending an e-mail with their comments to the ISDA.  He said there were just a handful, but we'll see.  I'll forward his e-mail to you when I receive it.  Have a good weekend!  Marie 
  Here are XTO's comments. Please respond to those that are credit related, which appear to be most of them.  Lucky you!  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Joe:  Tana said I should forward this e-mail to you and that you guys would prepare the assignment and send to us for review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Please note that all of the deals, with the exception of the first one, are EOL deals.  Thanks for your help.  Marie 
 Attached for your further handling is the Annex B for the related transaction.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie

 Hi, David:  As you can see, I have forwarded the master agreement to Mr. Sill for execution.  When you receive the executed copies, please complete the notice information on the Schedule.  I'm sure Pat can assist in the technical contacts if you aren't familiar with them.  In addition, please initial both copies and have John Suttle initial both copies before they are signed by EBS Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd.  Upon execution, please forward one fully signed copy to Mr. Sill and forward the other original copy to me in Houston.  I am processing the original Enron Corp. guaranty and will forward it to Uecomm when I receive it back from Enron Corp. and receive confirmation from you that you have the master agreement as signed by Uecomm.

 Will you e-mail me your form guaranty?  Thanks! 
 Hi, Cindy:  I'm assisting EBS in some of their trading work for awhile, so this is why I am sending you the attached memo requesting an Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Please let me know when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pick-up.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Becky:  I left early yesterday (as did everyone else) so I have no comments. 
 Hi, Nidia!  Per my voice mail, attached is the revised form of guaranty to add "Process Agent" section.  Please send this revised form to the counterparty asking that they use this form rather than the form of guaranty you sent them on Friday.  Let us know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Marie 
  Samantha:  Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.  He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.  I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.  Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.  Let me know if you have questions or need help.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Gordon:  We have received the draft ISDA Master Agreement back from Nemak, S.A. which they have executed.  It appears to be in order, so I am in the process of preparing it for execution by us.  The effective date on the agreement is July 30, 2001.  We can confirm transactions with them under this Master Agreement.  Once ENA has executed the document, I will send the general e-mail to everyone as usual.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 Thanks, that's nice to hear! 
 Hi, Tracy!  I couldn't remember if I was supposed to send you the final copy of the Schedule and Paragraph 13 or not, so what the heck, here they are!  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Veronica!  Have you had a chance to review their comments?  Marie 
 Mark:  I am attaching a revised list.  I forgot to show EBS, not that is has created a significant amount of work. Thanks!  Marie

  Will you gladly look at these four too?

 Hi, Maribel:  I don't know if you were copied on Tana Jones's e-mail, but Legal is preparing all confidentiality agreements once again, so instead of you having to prepare the agreement, if you will just provide us with the counterparty info (name, address, contact, etc.) we will prepare the CA, have initialled and forward to you for signature.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Wendi:  You don't believe everything Tana tells you, do you?  Haven't you realized she's just trying to get out of work?  At least now you know who really does the work in the Swap Group.  We will prepare your CA for you (since Tana won't).  Will you send Poli-Twine's address and fax number?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Not a thing!

Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - Enron North America Corp. and Catequil Overseas Partners, Ltd.  We have revised the definition of "Net Asset Value" set forth in Part 5(p)(b) of each agreement and feel this will take care of the issues.

 I'm okay. 
 Hallelujah!  Maybe now we won't go through as much paper as before. 
 Matt:  Here is the proposed language re appointing agents and attorneys-in-fact to sign confirmations.  We may need to run these by Mark Taylor for approval, as he approves the trading resolutions.  We need to make the appointments effective as of 5/1/01.  Also, Bryan Burnett, Edward Ondarza and Stewart Seeligson are with EBS, so I don't know if they are still officers of ENA.  Didn't Max Yzaguirre leave Enron altogether?  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Joe:  Attached are a clean and blacklined copy of the Partial Termination.  We have revised it to reflect a "new" transaction rather than a "replacement" transaction, since the existing transaction is still in place.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Tanya/Jay:  Have you looked into the 4 Peoples-related worksheets that Rudwell sent us to verify if we want to go ahead and draft ISDAs to send to them?  Please let us know if we should go ahead and draft or not.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Thanks!  If anyone should apologize for not responding in a timely fashion it should be me.  I'll work on preparing these documents and should have something to you soon.  Marie 
 Thank you for all your hard work.  This is something that has needed to be done, but no one would take the initiative.  Let's just hope all your hard work makes it to the datasheet.  Thanks!  Marie

 Ms. Rosenthal:  Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).  Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp. guaranty.  You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with reviewing same.  Thank you.

 Hi, Robbi!  Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.  How are things going now that Lance and Carol are there?  Hopefully, better.  Mark gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.  Kristina managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, Mark  saw right through them.  Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.  We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.  If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.  We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.  Would you let me know?  Also, we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane.  What is best for you?  Talk to you later.  Mare 
  Hi, Greg!  Wendy Conwell in Credit here in Houston forwarded this worksheet to us to prepare an omnibus confirmation for a deal between ECC and Atco Electric.  Since you guys are preparing confirms up there, I am forwarding the worksheet to you to prepare.

 I just received this e-mail from Todd Perkins at Southern Co. 
 Hi, Cindy:  Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of March 29, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing Enron Credit Inc.'s obligations under a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were originally executed by ENA and assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  Andy Fastow signed this guaranty.  Bear Stearns is now asking for certificates as to authority and incumbency, so I have prepared and attach them for processing.  In addition, Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of February 20, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing ENA's obligations under the Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were subsequently assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  We asked Bear Stearns to return the original Enron Corp. guaranty and apparently they have lost it.  In this regard, I am attaching a form of termination for that guaranty.  If it is in order, please process it for signature.  Thanks for your help and if you have any questions or need anything else, please let me know.  Marie x33907 
 I don't think another e-mail would be rude.  It's rude that she hasn't responded to our other requests.  Do you want to send it or do you want me to.  I'll be happy to.  Marie 
  FYI.  What's the big deal in CSFB not sending us their form of schedule until we send the form of Enron Corp. guaranty and said that ECT Investments will collateralize its trades?  Marie 
 Tanya:  You'll love this.  ALCOA has sent us an amendment to the ISDA (that was signed 1/99) and wants to amend the "threshold amount" in Part 1 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in Paragraph 13.  I think we are mixing apples and oranges!  Obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the ISDA in '99.  And it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master.  Marie 
 Mr. Giordano:  Attached are the final blacklined drafts of the ISDA Master Agreements for Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd. and Catequil Partners L.P., which incorporate your comments sent to us on 8/22.  With respect to "Valuation and Timing", we just inadvertently left that comment in, but have now deleted it.

 Oops, sorry! 
 Thanks, Veronica.  Brent Hendry is going to call you about Todd Perkins' e-mail.  We don't want to enter into an ISDA with an agency arrangement as it poses problems as far as netting and other matters.  Brent will call Todd and tell him that we will either enter into 6 separate masters or one master with Southern and then they can internally back to back trades.  So, I would not do anything until Brent speaks with you and Todd.  Marie

  David:  Your counterparty is being impossible.  Please see their latest message below.  They won't even send us their draft ISDA until we provide them with every little bit of info.  This is only a draft, not the final one.  It can and probably will be negotiated.  Thanks!  Marie

 Unless by trading group they meant the actual traders--we're just the lawyers and staff.  I'll send you an e-mail tonight when I can talk--if you get my drift. 
 Thanks for sending this.  I just spoke with Randy Miller and told him that we probably wouldn't get it to him today, but we would certainly send it over on Monday morning.  Samantha is working on it.

 Hi, Robbi!  I've been meaning to call you, but as you can imagine, it's been extremely busy here.  Hope you're okay and I'll try to talk with you soon.  No, we still haven't received anything from Robert Allen to return our fabric.  I was hoping they would send something last week, because we shipped our gifts to Washington and we could have sent it at the same time.  Let me know what you hear from them.  Let's try to get together after the 1st.  I know it's going to be too busy this week and next, so why don't we shoot for after the new year.  If I don't talk to you soon have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!  Marie

  The one from Tana is a picture, but if you scroll down further, I think it is the Bin Laden song, so there is sound with that one.  I also sent it home in case you can't open it or want to listen at home. 
 Thanks!  I'll use this one and delete the disclaimer. 
  The first one is a picture, but if you scroll down it should be the Bin Laden song, so there's sound.

 Hi, Sharon:  Did the BP Amoco Master Netting Agreement ever show up?  Marie 
  Eric and Russell:  I spoke with Roeline Hudson at Torch just a few minutes ago.  She is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until Monday.  She answered my question, so I will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review.  The lawyer may want verification from Torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned (specifically the Dynegy trades), which evidence of authority Roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on Monday.  Roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from UOM so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents.  We will want to see the additional documentation from UOM before we send the drafts out for review.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Marie 
 It was put in the interoffice pouch, so who knows where it is!

  Carroll just called me and told me that they had a janitorial position opening at the courthouse and did I want to send my resume. 
  I guess so, cause I got your e-mail.  Just in case, it's marie.heard@enron.com.

 Mary Cook has asked me to try to locate the documentation for the two prepays.  Which of the documents do you specifically need--all or just the ISDAs, swap confirmations and guarantees.

 Hi, Greg!  Mary Cook asked me to contact you regarding locating documents in connection with a couple of prepays.  The first is a prepay (December 13, 1999)  among ENA, Citibank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Toronto Dominion.  Is this Yosemite II?  If so, I have copies of the ISDA, swap confirms, etc.  Would you have copies of any other documents, or are there any other documents?  Also, they are looking for documentation in connection with the Corp. prepay for December 2000.  This was among ENA, Toronto Dominion, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley.  Do you happen to have copies of these documents or do you know the project name in case they were prepared here?  Thanks!  Marie

 Hi, Roeline:  No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.  We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be "business as usual" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.  Have a Happy Thanksgiving!  Marie

 (713) 896-1673.  It doesn't matter to me if we eat before or go for coffee after.  The only places I know to eat near the Wortham are at Bayou Place.  I know there's Hard Rock Cafe, a barbecue place and I don't know what else is there.  Let me know what you want to do. If we don't eat before, I guess we can meet at the bottom of the escalators at the theatre. 
 It would definitely be out of your way.  I don't mind driving downtown, so why don't we just meet at the Wortham at about 7?.

Thanks!  Marie 
 Thanks, Gordon.  I'll send them a letter asking for these items.  Thanks!  Marie

 Genia:  We have credit sign off on all masters, amendments, assignments and terminations--any document where credit is involved.
