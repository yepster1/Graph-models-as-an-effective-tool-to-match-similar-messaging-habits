 Hi, Roeline:  No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.  We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be "business as usual" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.  Have a Happy Thanksgiving!  Marie 
  Don't know if my response reached you or not.  When we reply to e-mails, it automatically puts "@ENRON" at the end, so I'm sending it again. 
 Thanks, Rod!

 (713) 896-1673.  It doesn't matter to me if we eat before or go for coffee after.  The only places I know to eat near the Wortham are at Bayou Place.  I know there's Hard Rock Cafe, a barbecue place and I don't know what else is there.  Let me know what you want to do. If we don't eat before, I guess we can meet at the bottom of the escalators at the theatre. 
 It would definitely be out of your way.  I don't mind driving downtown, so why don't we just meet at the Wortham at about 7?.  We have been parking in one of the outside lots off Smith right across from the side of the Wortham (the Bank One Lot) since the flood closed down so many of the underground garages. 
 Me too!
