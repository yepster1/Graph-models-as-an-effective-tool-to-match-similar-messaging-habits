l be preparing various master netting agreements and she would like to solicit as much additional help as she can.  If the directive changes before the meeting tomorrow, we will advise everyone.  Please review the below attachments prior to the meeting if your schedule allows.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Sara:  Attached are copies of the confirms.  I put a copy in each of the Citibank and Delta files.  I don't remember there being a project name.  Marie 
 Here are the guidelines for an ECP.  Hope this helps.  If not, let me know.  Is there supposed to be bad news coming? 
 Cindy:  This is the guaranty I spoke with Clement about.  It MUST be signed either this afternoon or first thing tomorrow morning.  It is our standard guaranty except that it is multiparty/multiproduct.  Please call me when it's ready and I'll send someone to pick it up.  Thanks!  Marie

 Hi, Bianca!  Francisco Pinto Leite has asked me to give him a list of all outstanding ISDAs and Deemed ISDAs with Mexican counterparties.  Can you send me a list of the Deemed ISDAs that are still outstanding (either comments received or counterparty has not returned signed copy).  Thanks!

 Esmeralda:  I'm available.  Thanks!  Marie 
 I'm just now going through my e-mails from last week as I was out cleaning up after the flood.  I had given Cynthia the omnibus forms before I left, so I don't know what they are doing/not doing up there.  Marie 
 WHAT????????  How can this be?  Who allowed this to happen?  What are we going to do?  There is no one worthy to take your place as favorite credit person.  Those structuring people can't possibly be nicer than us.  I guess I wish you well, although it's going to be bad for us.  Oh, as far as the HUGE Happy Hour, I hope you aren't getting your hopes up too high.  Remember, it's Bill!  Seriously, we will miss you and I wish you all the best.  Marie 
 Hi, Bernice!  I don't think Legal needs to review your correspondence requesting this information, but we will still need to receive copies of the name changes, mergers, etc.  Thanks!  Marie 
   Susan:  Attached are Frank's hedge fund forms.  The first one is a blackline and the second one is the actual form. 
 I have received the executed certificates from Enron Corp. and will send to= you via overnight courier.  I will also include the Termination of the Gua= ranty. 
  Aparna:  Below are Tidewater's comments to the omnibus confirmation.  Please let me know what changes are acceptable.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Tracy:  Will you handle this?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Tiffany:   Attached is the revised Annex B for the omnibus confirmation.  We have addressed the counterparty's concerns as follows:  1.	Annual vs. monthly financial statements - the annex provides for delivery of annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements.  It does not require delivery of monthly financial statements.  2.	We have revised Annex B to be 2- way, meaning that the provisions apply to both the counterparty and ENA.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
  Fred:  I am passing this e-mail along to Tracy Cooper.  I am no longer with EBS and Tracy is the paralegal who took my place, so she will be assisting you on preparing master agreements.  Hope all is well!  Marie

 Steve:  I have sent the amendment to the Agency Agreement to Gary Hickerson for signature on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  When executed, I will fax you a copy.  How do you want to handle obtaining Michael Brown's signature?  Do you want me to send the original to you and you will coordinate getting his signature, or do you want me to send it to Michael directly?  I know Michael, so I don't have a problem with sending it directly to him, or I can certainly send it to someone in Legal in London to coordinate getting his signature.  Please let me know how you want to handle this.  In addition, I made a few minor changes to the amendment.  ECT Investments' name is ECT Investments, Inc. with a comma between "Investments" and "Inc.".  Also, Gary Hickerson is President of ECT Investments rather than Managing Director, and I also added his and Michael's middle initials.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp.

 Ed:  Attached are the following:  1.	ConEd's form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 and  2.	Our comparison of the above documents.  Please review the following credit related items and let me know if you are okay with ConEd's language or if you would prefer our revision:  1.	Part 1(c) - "Cross Default" - ConEd has left in the provision re cross acceleration, which we usually take out, but leave in if our counterparty is a financial institution.  2.	Part 1(d) - "Credit Event Upon Merger" - will you agree to ConEd's language?  Also, I know you said that we were just going to comment on ConEd's version without credit, but Sara wanted to know if you want to include cross-default thresholds and the same matrix we are using in the two specific transactions.  Please let me have your response to the above as soon as possible so that we can send our comments to ConEd, as they are getting pretty agitated that we are taking so long.  Thanks!  Marie
