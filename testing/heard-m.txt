 Rebecca:  In connection with the upcoming Enron Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, Gary Hickerson's group typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers to authorize the transfer of funds from Enron Corp.'s brokerage account(s), in particular the account at Morgan Stanley.  Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.  The attached resolutions have been drafted using the December 13, 1994 resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, with the exception of the deletion of non-existing offices, change in officer titles and the addition of Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain.  I am attaching a copy of the certificate we sent to Morgan Stanley in connection with the opening of the account for Enron Corp. certifying the December 13, 1994 resolutions.  Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions or need any additional documentation.  Marie x33907

 Rebecca:  I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.  I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer.

IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number)  2.	Certificate of Incumbency certifying (i) a true and correct copy of the certificate of organization or formation and operating agreement and (ii) the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of the sole member/manager of GAF Refining.  3.

ENA will be providing a Certificate of Incumbency, certifying its articles of incorporation and bylaws and the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of ENA, together with a Certificate certifying resolutions as to its authority to enter into financial transactions and an IRS W-9.

 Pat:  Attached for your further handling is the revised Master Agreement deleting the "eligible contract participant" rep.  Marie 
  Tanya:  I don't remember if I forwarded this on or not.  When we receive counterparties' paper, should we forward on to you or would you prefer we send them to Jay or someone else?  Marie 
 I think it will be okay for them to sign.  They will need to print and sign two originals and return both copies to you.  Both David and John will need to initial before the agreements can be signed by an authorized officer.  Additionally, our notice information will need to be completed.  Once signed by Uecomm and returned to you, please let me know so that we can process the Enron Corp. guaranty or will David process it from your end?  Also, I don't know if you will keep the original in Australia or if it will come back to Houston.  Robbi, do you know?  We can cross that bridge once it is fully executed.  Hope this isn't too confusing!  Marie 
  Tracy:  Can you send the latest long haul SLAs to Pat since I don't have access to them.  If you're not sure which ones to send, check with Robbi.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Okay. 
 I don't blame you.  Obviously she's not dependable and her heart isn't in it, not to mention the fact that she doesn't know what she's doing and I don't think she wants to learn.  That was pretty obvious when I was training her--she never seemed to be interested in the job, otherwise she would have tried to learn all she could and would have at least taken some pride in her work. 
 Celeste:  I guess there's no credit?  Marie 
 I'm working on the guarantees now, so I should have the draft to a lawyer today. 
 Sorry to hear about Dirk.  I will certainly let you know if I hear of anything.  We don't need any samples at Kravet--we have found a piece of their fabric that we are pretty sure we want to get.  The contractor is starting work on our house Monday, so our fun will be beginning.  Talk to you later.  Marie 
 Here it is. 
 Hi, Ken!  I just received a call from Chris Croom who wants to send an updated ISDA draft to Avery Dennison Corp.  Can we use the same credit, or do you want to revise it?  He said he was going to meet with the counterparty on Tuesday, so I'm sure he either wants them to get the draft before then or he will take it with him.  Thanks!  Marie x33907 
 I don't know off the top of my head where they are?  Is there a blue file?  Do I have a memo in my memo directory where I sent them to Contract Admin? 
 Wayne:  I went to Tracy's office to help Cynthia look for the documents and Cynthia found them, so you should be getting copies shortly.  Marie 
 Hi, Anna!  I apologize for not calling you today, but things got pretty hectic and I misplaced your message. Besides the termination of the Enron Corp. guaranty guaranteeing obligations of Enron North America Corp., please provide me with a list of the corporate certificates you need.  This will help me in having everything signed that you need.  Thanks!  Marie  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp.

 Hi, Nidia!  Per my voice mail, attached is the revised form of guaranty to add "Process Agent" section.

  Samantha:  Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.  He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.  I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.  Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.  Let me know if you have questions or need help.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Gordon:  We have received the draft ISDA Master Agreement back from Nemak, S.A. which they have executed.  It appears to be in order, so I am in the process of preparing it for execution by us.
