 Thanks for the info on the recruiting expo.  Sounds like fun, but I won't b= e able to make it.  I am taking the day off on Friday, April 13th to take M= eagan for her info session and tour at UT.  We will be driving to Austin af= ter she gets out of school on Thursday afternoon, April 12. =20  You know that you can count me in already as a team member!  --Sally=20 
 Thanks for the update.  I am forwarding your message to Beth Apollo.  She is the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want to get her feedback as well.  --Sally 
 Great idea to run this by Louise.  She ususally has some good ideas on how things should look and feel online.  I would love to see it, too.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.  Thanks in advance for you help on this. 
 Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:  1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?  2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response."  3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box.  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter. 
 Per my memo below, please enroll Brenda Herod, James Scribner, Thresa Allen and Shona Wilson for the May session.  Thanks for the reminder and for your help!  --Sally 
 The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution. Thanks. 
 Is this on Vanessa's update list?  Are users happy with the results? 
 Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that. 
 FYI - Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Tight time frame for Mike & co. on metals deliverables.  Raises the question around the timing of next week's visit on metal.  Will we divert critical resources from these efforts.   --Sally 
 It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 
 I am following up with someone that was on Mary's team that now works for Beth Apollo.  We will get back with you on this shortly.  --Sally 
 Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --Sally 
 Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their = assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback fro= m the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it= would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer = so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums througho= ut the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summe= r?  It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  = I will be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.=20 
 I will be in the office the whole week of April 9.  I will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 30 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews.  --Sally 
 Sally has arranged Brian Wood with Avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow (Wednesday), April 4, 1:00 -2:00 PM.  Brian will meet at Sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the Enron Building for demonstration.  If you are interested in attending, please call me at x39106 so I can give Brian a headcount.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please ask Sheri Thomas if this person needs access to EOL applications.  I don't recognize the names.  The name noted as manager is Loyd Will, who is a commercial employee reporting to Kevin Presto.  Thanks. 
 Please put these dates on my calendar and let Lexi know that at this point = the calendar is open and that I will be happy to participate in both the in= formation session and the interviews.  Thanks. =20 
 I was at the pre-seasoner opener at Enron Field last Friday night and saw you throw the first pitch.  It was a nice one - never a chance of it hitting the dirt!  -Sally 
 Thanks for putting this together.  I will look forward to reading the details later today. --Sally 
 Can you print this for me?  Thanks. 
 You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!  I suppose that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two months away.  I will be glad to handle invitations.  I will look for some this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.  Cara had sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.  I still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.  I will call you tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home.  --Sally 
 Exactly!  Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with Anna.  I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.  I see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is?!?  --Sally 
 Looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion... 
 That was my third or fourth time at Ibeza - I have enjoyed it each time.  It is a great place for outside dining when the weather works for that.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.  --Sally 
 Resume attached per my voice mail to you.  This guy is currently at Compaq, but wants to do something else.  Any interest?  As I said in my voice mail, I will be glad to call my friend Dave Schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like.  --Sally 
 TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations  Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.  Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.  There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.  The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:  Business Unit	HR Contact	Phone# EGM 	David Hill	713/853-4218 EIM	Kathy Neal	713/345-7803 EA/Global Services	Frank De Jesus	713/345-3662 EA/Global Services	Hector McLoughlin	713/853-6703  Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services. 
 Gwynn,  Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something - if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.  Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and commodity operations.  Patti x39106 
 FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly.  --Sally 
 Please approve. 
 I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:  1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or  2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week. 
 Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks. 
 We will get you back on the official distribution list.  For now, I am forwarding our weekly report to you.  --Sally 
 I would like to have my directors and senior directors take this course.  There is just one course date noted in the attachment in May.  Will there be other dates during the year?  I can't have everyone go at the same time.  I would like to get the list of dates in 2001 and then send a memo to directors and senior directors requiring them to attend one of the sessions.  Can you also get me a list of the director and senior directors that I have in EIM, EGM and EA?  Will this course also be offered in London for directors?  --Sally 
 1)  Did you add to the numbers that Jeff and I reviewed with you on Sunday?  You had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates - did you do that?  UBS was asking me about numbers today, and I wanted to be consistent with the answers.  2)  What about Calgary?  You were going to ask Rob M. to have Peggy Hedstrom coordinate over the weekend.  Didn't hear from her.  Are you handling this through Rob?  Or do you want me to include Calgary operations in the final org chart for Netco Operations?  --Sally 
 Good response, Bob.  Thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting.  --Sally 
 FYI - See attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the "ill-defined".  If this is not on target, we will keep working until it is!  - Sally 
 All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally 
 Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally 
 Bob,  Sally is out all day w/ UT recruiting function.  She will not be back into the office until 8:00 Thursday for CommodityLogic meeting.  I am forwarding this to Bob Hall - please check with him regarding how he would like this handled.  Thanks, PT 
 In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic.  Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist  User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and 		Financial Settlements  Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic  NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations) ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations)   Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.  In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic. 
 Thanks for your list.  I will add these to our Hot List.  Let me know about the A/R.  Thanks.  Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.  --Sally    Peggy Hedstrom 03/26/2001 01:54 PM 
 FYI - sounds as if Michelle is accepting.  Do you have anything firm from her?  --Sally 
 FYI  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one. 
 Frank & Hector,  Here is the list of contractors that Kymberly sent Sally - please compare to list from Peggy McCurley that Sally gave you last week.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 1)  I believe that Tom Martin is talking with Chris Germany about taking the logistics role for the Texas region with Daren's planned departure.  Please coordinate with Tom and Bob Superty on where they are in this process of replacing Daren.  2)  I am not sure that I know what database you are referencing.  He is on the current proposed org chart for Netco Energy Operations under Operational Databases (part of the Documentation team).  It is correct that his name is on the list that I provided to you yesterday.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  --Sally 
 I am so glad that you will be able to interview.  I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron.  --Sally 
 Bob & Leslie,  Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your availability.  2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.  I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 2nd meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I will be in New York on business on March 30th.  Sorry that I will not be = able to attend.  The other person that I would send in my place is Beth Apo= llo.  However, she will be on vacation next week.  Can you give me any info= that may be made available?  Thanks. =20 
 Here is Rick's response - sounds more like a concern on his part on losing people and some of their reasons cited for leaving.  Do you know who has left? 
 Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.  Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.  This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of 		record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)  Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of 			transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)  Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth 		Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on 		ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting) 
  FYI 
 I enjoyed lunch, too.  Glad you included Kristin.  When do Jo and the kids leave for England?  We should try to have lunch with our gangs before then.  Let me know.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the invitation.  I will be out of town April 25 through 27, so unfortunately I will have to miss the game.  --Sally 
 Please put this on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks.  --Sally 
 Glad you followed up - I don't know why you would have been deleted, but I am glad that is straightened out. I will look for the feedback form via e-mail.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you liked the pictures.  We would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.  If you thought it would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner together.  I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday night before heading to Amanda's recital.  Then you could make your drive back on Wednesday after breakfast. Whatever works for you will be great, though.  I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League National meeting.  Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.  My Thursday night is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.  She lives in Whittier, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.  I know that we will have a good time catching up. 
 We have set Monday, June 11 for the date of our Operations PRC that will include employees that are supporting ENA, EGM and EIM.  You mentioned that your functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.  It would certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your functional PRC.  While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operations during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations.  I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC meeting in setting the date for your meeting.  Please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your PRC.  Thanks. 
 Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team)  You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.  My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Causey.  In that meeting we review director level and above.  Rick has not set the date for that meeting. 
 I always like to heart good news.  I can't say that I have been deluged with examples since that meeting in January.  I will ask Patti to set up a meeting sometime this week for us to get together.  --Sally 
 I can't say that this will make me sad to lose this job.  Enjoy it!  --Sally 
 I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe tha= t person could shed light on this for both of us.=20  There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the= name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn'= t match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if t= hat is where this is coming from?  Norma (whose last name I don't know) who= works for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC na= me that was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously = seem to relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported = in through Operations.  When I asked Norma to read me the names of employee= s in that RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.  I told her that we ha= d not used the term "IBS" in a while.  Norma asked if the RC name should be= consistent with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes s= ense and she said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a= name change, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this inf= o gets us back on the right track.  --Sally=20 
 I will keep you posted on time and location for the meeting on the 11th.  If you join us for discussions on VP's, we will review Brent Price, Bob Hall, Peggy Hedstrom and Beth Apollo.  If you want to sit in on review of senior directors, that would pick up Leslie Reeves, James Scribner, Brenda Herod, Kevin Sweeney and Sheila Glover.  --Sally 
 Enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago.  At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.  I understand from Ted Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs.  You might check with Lexi Elliot (one of the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs.  If we have more jobs than interns, then Lexi could help in the process of interviewing Debbie for a position.  My last conversation with Ted Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with Lexi.  --Sally 
 On PRC:  In the next few days, I will be able to give Tina an idea on the time when we will start Senior Directors in the June 11th meeting and we will keep you posted that day on timing.  Contracts:  I met this morning with Robert Jones and Ryan Seleznov on contracts for Brent and Bob.  They were going to get with Michelle Cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day. (Legal has their offsite starting Wednesday, so we will be out of luck for legal help after today.)  I will keep you posted.  I believe that these new contracts will be well received.  Q2 Goals:  Patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and Philippe for next Monday at 3:00.  --Sally 
  Let's coordinate on needs for confirmations and settlements.  Can someone on your team specify what their needs will be?  Then we can determine the best method to obtain the machines.  I will have copies of the floor plans for 5 and 6 sometime this morning -- we should determine best placement for these.  --Sally 
 Did the numbers that we gave you yesterday on Operations hold up after your meeting with UBS?  Amy Fitzpatrick is calling me to get names.  Our primary focus yesterday was on number of positions.  We identified names in most cases, but not all.  Before that is finalized and I pass names along to Amy, I wanted to know if we were okay with the numbers.   Please let me know.  Names can be finalized this afternoonis we are set on numbers.  --Sally x35926  Cell:  713-417-1591 
 FYI --- 
 Thanks for copying me on Michael Brown's note.  Brenda Herod flew to London last night and should be in the London office today.  I am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this.  She and I visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in London for the pulp and paper effort.  So as to not steal her thunder, it will suffice to say that I am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing EGM model.  --Sally 
 Please approve this request.  Brent Price is my direct report and is responsible for the RC's included in this request.  Thanks.  --Sally Beck 
 I have put the staff meeting referenced at the bottom of John's message on my calendar.  Please check with Kim on the location and as to whether or not future dates are set.  Also, please check to see if date for offsite has been set.  We are trying to schedule a vacation, and it would help to know the dates of the offsite.  Thanks. 
 FYI - 
  Please see if you can get this to print so that I get all of the info.  I tried it 100 times on Friday and could only one page to print, which did not include all of the information.  Thanks.  NEED THIS TODAY. 
 You are welcome to attend any of these.  In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.  Do get with Jeff and Stacey before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.  PATTI:  Please add Beth to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.  Thanks. 
 We are planning a meeting with the teams lead by Meredith,  Mark Evans and Mary Lynne Ruffner this afternoon - you should be getting information from Meredith shortly with time and location.  During that meeting we will clarify this memo for everyone.  --Sally 
 At the end of my 3:00 meeting with Philippe and Greg today I will get clarification about the international travel.  It is hard for me to believe that Philippe or Beth Perlman or Greg Piper will fly coach to London.  I will keep you posted.  -Sally 
 FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by RAC.  I don't think that RAC needs to have approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on EOL with the approved trader list.  This may be part of your process.  If not, it probably should be incorporated.  Then you may want to educate the RAC team on your approval process.  Let me know if you need and help or support from me.  Hope that all is well.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on a job done well in a short period of time.  Your note of thanks to everyone was a nice one.   I am sure that the team appreciates your leadership.  --Sally 
 Thanks for copying me on this note.  I have sent a suggestion to Sheri and asked her to respond to Frank  Hayden.  --Sally 
 Good solution - and you are right, this falls under our normal Educational Assistance program.  Thanks for the update.  --Sally 
 The name that I couldn't remember when we spoke yesterday if Geoffrey Mann - Americas CEO.  Accompanying him will be Jim Martino from the Austin office.  They will be here at 9:00 and I will have them come to the 33rd floor and I will meet with them for a few minutes.  Then I can call you and walk them to wherever you are going to meet with them.  Again, thanks for making this work for your schedule.  Business decisions about what Viviance can provide for you are clearly yours.  I do appreciate your willingness to give them your time and a fair "audience".  I know that my sister is very bullish on the quality of the product that they deliver. 
 I look forward to seeing you again on Thursday morning and to meeting Mr. Mann.  You will need to check in at the front desk in the lobby.  Usually, the process is that they will call to let me know that you are here.  My extention is 35926.  You will get a visitors badge and then you will go to the 33rd floor.  There is a reception area on 33.  I will meet you there.  --Sally Beck 
 Your list looked good and I approved all as reviewers.  We can talk about how the VP PRC process works - there will be an opportunity there to provide info to various commercial MD's that will be in attendance at the meeting.  We will make sure that we prepare the attendees well.  --Sally 
 Thanks for joining us for dinner last week.   It was good to see you again as well.  I hope that your temporary move to Houston goes smoothly.  Please call me with a contact number for you this summer.  We can get together while you are in town for your summer internship.  --Sally 
 I know that the timing on choosing these interns was short.  Thanks for responding back to Jana so quickly.  And now most of them will be here next Monday!  Please be certain that you and your assistant are actively working on a location, phone and computer (with necessary access granted) for these interns.  I want to be certain that all interns have a very positive introduction to working at Enron.  This list excludes those that will assigned to EGM under Brent Price and his team.  As soon as I get an updated list from Jana, I will schedule a meeting for this week so that we can discuss how we will make the internships a success this summer.  All ideas will be welcome, so get creative before coming to the meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I want to keep track of summer interns.  Please make me a desk file.  This list is missing summer interns under Brent.  I have asked Jana to send me an updated list.  I have also sent her a message letting her know that Sheri Thomas now reports into Andy Zipper and that she needs to communicate with Sheri and Andy directly regarding Greg Carlson's internship.  Also, did you keep copies of resumes of the analysts?  Can you pull resumes for the interns that will be assigned to us?  I would like to review them.  I also want to hold a meeting later this week with all supervisors who will have interns reporting to them.  Please check with the listed supervisor on Jana's list.  If one of their direct reports will actually be the primary supervisor, please get that name.  Thanks. -Sally 
 FYI 
 Could I be included in these update meetings?  Rather than read the material after the fact and have you review it with me separately, it seems that it would make sense for me to be included in the update meeting that you hold with Rick.  Assuming that Rick is comfortable with that, can we do that going forward?  If all agree, please ask your assistant to let me know if a date has already been set for the next update.  Thanks.  . 
 Happy for Hector and Laura to attend.  --Sally 
 Please print atttachment for me.  Thanks. 
 Here are the two for Brent.  Please get copies of resumes from Jana.  Please set up a meeting for later this week with all who will be supervisors of interns.  Include Brent as well.  Thanks.  (thirty minutes will be fine) 
  Let's talk about this one.  _sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I have sent a message to Beth Apollo, who is James' supervisor.  Beth is out for the next two days, and will return to the office on Wednesday.  I will make sure that Beth and James make a point of talking with you about this opportunity.  --Sally 
 You may want to consider her.  We can discuss.  --Sally 
 I regret that I will miss the first Global Accounting Steering Committee Meeting on Tuesday, May 15.  I am taking that day as a vacation day while my parents are in Houston for Amanda's piano recital.  I will be in attendance at the next two meetings in May - the 22nd CAO Meeting and the 29th Steering Committee Meeting. 
 I will be out of the office on Tuesday, May 15.  I am taking a vacation day while my parents will be in town for my daughter's piano recital.  Patti (x39106) has cell and home numbers where I can be reached.  I will be back in the office on Wednesday, May 16. 
 Please print attachment in color.  Also print all other recent e:mails from Mechelle.  Thanks. 
 It was a pleasure to meet you last week when you were in Houston.   You arrived with a some good advance "press" from Cindy, all of which was well founded.  I am glad that your meeting with Tom was fruitful and I am pleased that there may be a fit between Enron's needs and Vivance's offerings.  I know that Cindy is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.  I have e-mailed JIm Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.  While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.  Let me know when you will be back in Houston.  If you like Mexican food, I can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal.  --Sally 
 Here is agenda for Causey's offsite next week.  I told Sharron that you would be in town and she said that you (and Anna) would certainly be welcome for all or part of the day.  FYI - the location for this meeting is at the Adams Mark Hotel.  This is not very close to downtown - would require a car or cab.  I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which things you would like to attend.  My thoughts are that I will not attend for the entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office.  Let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.  --Sally 
 June 12 works well for me.  It is likely that we will be on vacation on Friday, June 22.  My husband is finalizing airline reservations today, and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on Friday, June 22 rather than Saturday, June 23.  --Sally 
 I remember you well, Christine, from the recruiting process.  I would love to visit with you to catch up on what you have done at Enron to date and to talk with you about a rotation in my group.  By copy of this memo, I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to get together.  I look forward to seeing you.  --Sally 
 Peggy:  I will be at the meeting at 12:00, but will need to leave around 12:30 for a meeting with someone from London.  Our schedules wouldn't allow for any other time for us to get together, and I have some critical things to review regarding London.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the details on the flowers.  That should be enough for us to produce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer.  David must have had a brain lapse - he forgot to mention that you had called.  Meagan and I were probably at the Bearkadette officers meeting at the time.  We really enjoyed your visit as well!  Thanks for supporting Amanda in her musical efforts.  --Sally 
 We  need to talk. 
 Do you want my help in preparing something for Paul?  Would you like me to go with you when you meet with Paul? 
  Can you print the attachment for me?  Thanks. 
 The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the close date to July 1).  Brian Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close.  Bob Hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.  As I explained earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in June.  After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to June 1.  The effort on our part should diminish substantially after June 30. 
 What do we do with this?  I logged in, but couldn't tell what to do.  --Sally 
 I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you= to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that= I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously play= ed by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscor= e the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my = operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping = my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can ha= ve an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once= in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over= gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  = Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be = out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the righ= t players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact = Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your = support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within= operations.  --Sally 
 I have left John a message about the e-mail.  No response yet.  Will call Leslie, Stacey and Jeff as soon as I finish breakfast. 
  Can you print attachment for me?  Thanks. 
 The deadline has been extended by HR until Tuesday, so that many of us can work on these reviews over the weekend.  You should see more responses early next week.  --Sally 
 Informational for me, or do you want me to attend?  If you don't want me to attend, would you like for me to review the presentation that you plan to give?  --Sally 
 My first and second choices on speaking engagements are listed below:  1st choice	MG906		Wed, July 11	Who Moved My Cheese?  2nd choice	MG909		Fri., July 13	Leading Your Firm Through Change  Frank and Hector have been on point for further participation in the conference and would be best to visit with about use of other passes to the conference.  Wes Colwell has co-sponsored our involvement in this conference.  Are the four passes intended to cover his group, too?  --Sally 
 Glad that the two of you could make the trip to Houston this week.  Hopefully, your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts.  I Anna, I will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities.  Mike, I will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite (late Oct) and on likely dates for my next trip to London.  I enjoyed the shopping and dinner.  --Sally 
 Patti is sending you my slides for the offsite - I finally got out of meetings long enough to review them!  There will be four parts to the Mid/Back Office hour and a half on the agenda:  Global Risk Management Operations - Overview of Services (Beck providing slides)  IT Systems - Overview and Organization (Perlman providing slides) )  CommodityLogic Modules (Gros providing slides)  Commercialization Effort (the three of us are working on a few slides - to come later today) 
 Change in plans - Patti will send slides for both me and Beth.  She is formating info from Beth's assistant into format that I used for my slides, so you will get these as one presentation.  (Patti has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.)  I think that you already have slides from Tom on CommodityLogic.  We are working on a few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon as we can.   Thanks, Tina. --Sally 
 There is another Senior Director in London in Operations - Anna McAndrew.  She was just joined Enron in April, and I was unsure of her title.  Confirmed that this morning. 
 What is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special to the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't know enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for $60?  Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, anyway.  You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in full force for later life -- only kidding!) --Sally 
  Please put this date on my calendar and let Lexi know that I will be glad to attend.  Thanks. 
 John:  I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.  We  need some questions answered first to go through this:  1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.  2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?  4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?  5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?  We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.  --Sally 
 Please print 
 Evan has close to 300 people reporting to him.  The largest segment is the service management team.  My understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers.  We will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale, and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions.  I don't think we are in danger of getting Mark back.  --Sally 
 Kristin, I know that we would like to get together with you to discuss UT recruiting.  The easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work.  My assistant is Patti Thompson (x39106) and Rick's assistant is Sharron Westbrook.   By copy of this note, I will ask  Patti to coordinate with Sharron and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that Rick and I could get with you.  -Sally 
 Please coordinate with Sharron on Rick's schedule and get back with Kristin to set up a meeting. Thanks. --Sally 
 Please print color versions of attachments, along with black and white of Anna's cover note.  Thanks. 
 Please print attachment for me.  Thanks. 
  FYI 
 I printed copies of this resume the day that I received it from you.  I met with Beth Perlman that day and gave her the resume in person.  I also called Philippe Bibi and sent him a copy of the resume.  I am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy Robert Jones on this resume.  Robert heads up HR for Enron Net Works.  Feel free to give Beth, Philippe and Robert a call to add your personal comments about the candidate.  --Sally 
 What do you think?  I have never been crazy about the Commercial Support tag myself.  Do you like professional services?  Or do you have another suggestion.  Please send me your comments within the next day or so.  I would like to get back to David Oxley soon.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Got your note.  I am not incredibly attached to Commercial Support and I agree that overall it probably sounds second class.   Professional Services sounds fine to me.  I have forwarded your message to a handful of my direct reports to get their comments - Bob Hall, Brent Price, Beth Apollo and Peggy Hedstrom.  I should hear back from them today, and I will pass along any pertinent comments.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 You have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization to support wholesale, but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized.  We have had meetings about specific issues, but have not generally discussed how we will manage the Estate going forward.  What role do you envision that I will play?  Can you make time to discuss that on Monday?  I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activities) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources.   With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams' efforts.  I will be glad to share that with you as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs.  --Sally 
 Greg Piper and Robert Jones are aware that I will be on vacation on the date of the PRC meeting.  --Sally 
 Thanks.  We will add Greg to the list and will get back with him on details.  -Sally 
 Sorry to hear about your grandmother.  Funerals, oddly enough, seem to create opportunities to catch up with other family members.  Nice to see everyone, you are just sorry about the catalyst for bringing you together.  I will talk with you soon.  --Sally 
 We may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function.  We had a lunch meeting with John Lavorato, Dave Delainey, Wes, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (Evan Hughes) under EES.  Final decision expected this week.  --Sally 
  Bob Hall says Professional Services is fine - "change is good", as he said.  Brent's other suggestions are below.  I agree with you - simply changing the label doesn't do a whole lot.  Actions will speak louder than words.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the follow up.  --sally 
 We will be in Telluride the last week in June for vacation.  Any suggestions on where we should eat?  Think 17, 12 and 3 (children's ages).  Thanks!  --Sally 
 FYI - as we get closer to quarter end, it may help your DPR team to know about any pending deals that could be done close to quarter end.  --Sally 
 As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926) 
 I understand from Greg that he got a little more direction from Paul about the Calpine meeting that has been moved to Thursday morning.  Please send Beth Perlman and me a copy of the revised draft of the meeting document that you are preparing, in addition to Tom.  Thanks. 
 Where are we on decisions on promotions?  Last time I asked, it was under consideration.  Kevin has a good idea here.  Can you give us an update?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Another opinion.  I read Barry's response from EBS.  Not a lot of overwhelming sentiment for Professional Services.  Since this in only a term used in the PRC process, I don't know that a name change at this point would make much of a difference.  Let me know is decided.  --Sally 
 I didn't have an opening that looked quite right for Dan's experiece.  I have, however, given has resume to Tom Gros who has been leading CommodityLogic and is also paired with Beth Perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services.  In this effort, it is likely that Tom will to put together a marketing team.  I suggested that he consider Dan for one of those positions. 
 FYI - I will fill you in on the meeting this afternoon and will get you a copy of whatever we review.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 I left individual voice mail messages for Chris, Johnny, John, Tom, Keith, Susan and Susie tonight, thanking them for spending part of their Saturday in the office.  I appreciate your personal organization and leadership of the team so that the DPR could be completed Saturday morning and delivered to RAC for their further analysis over the weekend.  Thanks, too, for spending part of your weekend in the office.  Your willingness to pitch in and your constructive suggestions on leading and motivating employees is very much appreciated. 
 Trading activity on EnronOnline continues be at or above trade count levels for the same period last month.  Jim Donnell, President and CEO of Duke Energy North America, stated at an industry conference on Friday, October 26 that for Duke it is "business as ususal" with Enron.  Enron remains an active counterparty trading with Duke.  At the same Independent Petroleum Association of Amercia industry event, Joe Bob Perkins, group president for Reliant Energy's wholesale businesses, stated that Reliant continues to actively trade with Enron as well. 
 Will do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.  Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.  What would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --Sally 
 Since you are the lead, I assume that you have an idea from Dave on what he is looking for.  Since Dave referenced ENW, I assume that we will include roles with regard to IT development projects.  Do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of Infrastructure roles as well?  --Sally 
 Anything we can do on this?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series of breakfast meetings: (example noted below from today's meeting)  Name			Title		Group 				Direct Supervisor   Jeff Gossett		Director		Operations - Gas Risk (EA)	Bob Hall  La Metrice Dopson	Sr. Director	IT Infrastructure			Jenny Rub    Mark, Greg and I need to have this information the day before the scheduled breakfast meeting.  The group description may be the most difficult to get, but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within ENW and what they do.  I will be glad to help you with the details - just let me know.   Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization.  I would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning.  Thanks.  --Sally  Can I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings?  The list that I used last week for Senior Directors and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.  I just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.  Thanks. 
 Operator error - I misspelled your name.  Probably too late to include.  Sorry, I didn't see the failed delivery attempt until today.  Been kind of hectic at Enron!  --Sally 
 Please do the same thing with e-mails from MIke Jordan.  thanks. 
 I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.  Please check all to see if they have been approved.  From this point forward, I don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.  Please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to forward to you for you to check.  Please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted.  Thanks.  Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from Melissa relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from Melissa.  Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for Houston's Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from Marilyn Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.  This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 FYI...Sally 
 Approval still needed?  I do want to review anything at this point.  -Sally 
 Only a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!   The artickale was great.  In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports.  Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked.  I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for upcoming articles.  Sounds as if your son had a strong start at Kleb as well.  This second six weeks is proving to be a little more challenging for Amanda - or her effort may have gotten diverted!  I am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calendar.  --Sally 
 Need to use this in contact list that I believe Tina put together for ENW. 
 approval still needed? 
 I am just a little tardy in working my way through e-mails!  I understand that you will be joining Beth Apollo's risk team in EES soon.  A win-win situation for everyone involved, I believe.  Please let me know when you will next be in town - would love to see you.  --Sally 
 Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed.  I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues.  I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.  I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that I had not known before.  Seems like a good group.  --Sally 
 Approval still required?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  --Sally  (I do want to see all of these right now) 
 Yes, it has only taken me 23 days to respond, but yes I would like to get this report.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 In case you missed this, just wanted you to see that this Enron Net Works publication that to date has focused only on the IT organization has now been broadened in scope.  The hot link to the site should work, and if you click on Features and then Energy Operations you will see the article referred to below.  The editor has spoken to a couple of you also.  Her plan is to get with each one of you and to run a series of articles about Operations.  --Sally 
 Let's save this in case I have to send out something to all management committee members.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Cleaning out e-mails.  Does this still need approval?  --Sally 
 Yes - at 3:40 pm.  Will try to leave by 4:00 or so.  --Sally 
 Thanks for finding this!  I have printed it on a color copier, so I will have it with me as an example - am actually pretty close to being finished.  Had a fun visit with Cara and Anna.  What a cutie Anna is!  And what a good baby - still haven't heard a cry, or at least not one like my kids could produce!  They left after breakfast this morning, while most of us were at church.  Meagan stayed home to work on essays for college applications.  So sorry to hear about the car wreck.  Glad that you two are okay, but what an inconvenience.  Hope that the other guys insurance covers everything.  --Sally 
 Declines in Houston and replacements are noted below:  Declined				Replaced by  Chris Chang (Financial Settlements)		Gordon Heaney  Kelli Little (Gas Risk Management)		Matt Olney  Anna Kulic (Gas Risk Management)		Monte Jones  Susan Scott (Gas Scheduling)			Shannon Groenwald  I do not have updated information on acceptances or declines from Portland or Calgary Operations at this time. --Sally 
 I worlked with Jeff Gosset, Stacey White and Bob Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  Tana Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  I mentioned to Tana that letters had been given to both Jeff Gossett and Bob Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have Jeff covered, but with the change in Bob Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  Tana was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that Bob Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.  Next week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.  Wanted you to see my reply to Fernley below.  --Sally 
 Please see exchange below.  Can you send me current plans - who, when, where and what - for London reviews?  I would put a several day moratorium on contacting London regarding upcoming Doorstep review plans until I get back with you.  Thanks.  --Sally  I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.  What happened to that effort?  Sounds as if from the London e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world. 
 In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.  Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally 
 I won't sent this to you daily, but this is what we are providing to Treasury each day.  FYI --Sally 
 Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied Bob Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --Sally 
 Let's talk tomorrow about how we get everyone on the ball and thinking. 
  Please print attachement on cashflows for me - then delete my e-mail.  Thanks. 
 Please print message and attachment for me.  Thanks.  --Sally (then message can be deleted)

 Data only:  Enron Board met this morning; afternoon management committee meeting had been planned for today beginning at 2:30; that afternoon session postponed; short meeting with management committee was held an hour ago.  Call me later if you want details.  --Sally 
 I won't be able to attend the meeting on Friday.   I have an eye doctor's appointment at 9:30, so it is also unlikely that I will be able to call in, unless I am pleasantly surprised and he is running on time!  I will take the dial in number with me to the appointment in the event that I am somewhere in the process that allows me to dial in.  --Sally 
  In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --Sally 
 I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by Bob Superty.  Bob is the director of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader Enron Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.  You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.  Your thoughts?  --Sally 
 I got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch  - our list of senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.  I thought that Murray was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.  I asked Christina to verify his title and to find out if he was in Houston this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.  Does he report to you?  Hope that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.  --Sally 
 Didn't notice this e-mail yesterday!! --Sally 
 I am so glad that you joined us for dinner, as well.  I noticed that the Dean jokingly said that the scholarship checks were "in the mail".  The University does send those checks to the students, so please let me know if you have not received that.  It was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner.  Please keep me posted on your plans after graduation.  Sally Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 EIM's budget meeting with Lay/Whalley/Frevert has been moved from Wednesday, October 24 to Monday, November 5.  Kerry Roper sent you an e-mail message today with revised dates for budget reviews.  McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).  I am coordinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.  Kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to EIM.  They will okay the current EOL allocation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology.  Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.  When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the intent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday.  Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.  I suggested that on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subject to final sign-off) for EIM.  The footnote should also say final reviews with EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business units are still preliminary.  I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Whalley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions since our review with Whalley 10 days ago.  --Sally 
 If you can make a call from where you are, let mw know and I will give you a download on both the all-employee meeting and our lunch meeting.  --Sally  Feel free also to call me during my commute home tonight (613-417-1591) or at home tonight (281-370-8568).  Happy birthday tomorrow! --Sally 
 Pumpkin recipe dip attached.  Absolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next year.  Perhaps you would consider being the official Editor for next year?  That is the job that you are really doing!  Meagan sent her application in to OU today.  It's one of four schools to which she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.  But it is nice to get one out the door!  --Sally  My assistant is faxing the two pages regarding news from national. 
 I will mail the checks and money to Barb.  There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed "filler".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the recipe in my briefcase.  Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!  At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.  Had planned to drop that off as well.  I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later.  Thanks again for all of your hard work!!! --Sally 
 Information forwarded below indicates that through October 22, we have not seen a drop off in deal counts executed through EnronOnline for derivatives trading.  Please let me know if you need additional information.  --Sally Beck (x35926) 
 Robin:  Several people gave me ad requests for the November newsletter.  I have had a crazy day at the office - should actually have been travelling to OU to interview students today.  Here are the ad contents.  I will try to call you on my way home and see if it is convenient to drop by the forms and the money.  In case I miss you, here are the contents:     Ashley Stone  Congratulations on being voted "Wittiest" at Klein. We always knew you were!  Love, Mom, Dad and Stefani  _________________________________   Congratulations!  Pam Martin National Merit Commended Student  Love, Mom and Dad  _________________________________  Happy 17th Birthday  Kim (her mom didn't put a last name, but we may want to - I am blank, she is the daughter of Barbara ??????, our historian)  With love and friendship' Vivian and Lori Young  _________________________________  Happy 13th Birthday  Chelsey Klingsporn (check spelling of name in directory - her mom paid for ad, but did not fill out a pink slip) Love, Mom and Dad  _________________________________   Other newsletter items:  Nancy Ramsey wanted to mention that sympathy goes out to Theresa and (her daughter's name?) on the death of their mother-in-law and grandmother  There will be a food drive for TEAM and NAM at the December tea - Claire Loria was to check with philanthropy chairs to find out if certain items would be needed by the TEAM and NAM food pantries - did she send you that detail?  --Sally 
 713-417-1591  It's about 6:45 pm right now - I need to spend 15 minutes or so on open items on my desk, then I will be headed home.  Commute takes about 35 minutes this time of night.  Try me in the car about 7:15 pm tonight and I can fill you in during my commute.  Feel free to call me at home tonight as well.  Best after 9:30 pm - 281-370-8568.  Other option will be during my commute tomorrow morning.  Try me in the car about 7:15 am.  --Sally 
 I will be at the Hyatt tomorrow for the all-employee meeting and I hope that each one of you will plan to attend as well.  Certainly with current press coverage and market reaction last week and today, there will be many questions for Ken, Greg and Mark to address tomorrow.  It will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of ENW to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting.  To provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting, I invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ECS 4990 beginning at 12:00 noon.  This will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have.  It will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams.  --Sally  Please let Christina Valdez know today (x39106 or e-mail) if you will be at lunch on Tuesday so that we can place an order. 
 This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for the same time last month.  We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.    Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.  I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since Mark and Greg are both travelling, I think that it is important to both Ken Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I discussed this with Greg Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.  Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?  I need to send a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.  Beth Perlman suggested that we included Senior Directors and above.  Are you two okay with this?  --Sally 
 Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Let me know if I can help.  --Sally 
 Do you want to have Jenny Rub join us for this budget meeting to review IT Infrastructure costs?  She owns that piece of the ENW budget.  Let me know.  Another option is that Anthony and I could cover those costs, with the option to contact Jenny if more detail is required.  --Sally 
 I am going to miss the reception on Sunday evening and interviews on Monday.  I will arrive on Monday night and will interview on Tuesday.  Look forward to seeing you then.  --Sally 
 Thanks, Jeff.  I will get you more info for you and your team in early November.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the info, Bob.  I will get you more details on the tournament in early November.  --Sally 
 I will be there.  I will fill you and Mark in on what we hear.  --Sally=20 
 Is this for all assistants within ENW?  How many are there?  I would certainly be glad to split the cost with Mark and Greg.  --Sally 
 Since I was undecided on this meeting, I did not RSVP.  You may have alread= y done so for me.  I do want to let them know that I plan to attend now.  T= hanks.  --Sally=20  I do see Piper on the invitation list. =20 
 To give you more free time on the weekend...  Shona:  Does this impact you?  Does anyone in your group plan to be in over the weekend? 
 RE:  Golf Tournament at Ravenaux Country Club, Monday, November 19th 11:00 am Registration and Range Balls; 12:00 Noon Shotgun Start    Please send me the list players for each foursome, along with their handicaps and phone numbers by Friday this week?   Thanks.  Will provide more information for all players prior to tournament.  Foursomes  Beth Apollo (2):  EES and Global Services  Brent Price (1)  Kevin Sweeney (1)  Bob Hall (2):  Risk and Logistics  Chantelle:  Brent has given me names of players for his foursome - Brent, Scott Earnest; John Swinney and Frank Prejean.  Can you get handicaps and phone numbers (Enron) for me?  Thanks. 
 Please print a color copy for me.  Thanks.  Also, forward to Bob Hall - I can never be sure that attachments forward correctly.  Thanks.  --Sally 
   The following individuals from The University of Texas at Austin have agreed to join us honoring Enron/UT MBA Scholar Recipients Holland Brown, Christopher Cashman, and Soo Pang Tang:  Dean Bob May, McComb School of Business Dr. Linda Golden, Professor of Marketing Dr. Ehud Ronn, Director of Energy Finance Dr. Angela Dorsey, Assistant Director of Energy Finance Dr. Beverly Hadaway, Director of EDS Financial Trading & Technical Center  See you there!  Sally 713.417.1591 (cell #) 
 Probably should have sent this to you as well as Brent.  --Sally 
 Thanks for forwarding the note to me.  I have asked Shona and Brent to get back with me on answers to your questions.  Shona's team did move this weekend to ECS (as did I), and I am not sure how much additional chaos this has added to her life for today!  I will follow up with her mid -afternoon on details.  I agree with you that this serves as a good case study  - underscores indeed that we need to start some of the projects under Project Greenlight instead of continuing to document problems.  By definition,  to arrive at complete and accurate transfer daily of information from all source systems to RisktRAC, we must know the universe of all books and spreadsheets.  --Sally 
 Sorry to cut the conversation short last night, but frankly I was in tears and it didn't make sense to continue the conversation.  Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best for you.  We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you.   My reaction last night was simply shock, because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.  And your lead in to the conversation with "you know we are staying at a hotel...", was such a surprise.  Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving, but that was with Cindy, Richard, Brigeda, Chris and Cara staying in our home as well.  With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to the contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home.  What you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.  But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.  I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a frame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room.  Certainly other guests can enjoy these things, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit.  I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.  Sounds as if we should make that the "norm" from this point forward, and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone.  I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.  I am planning to take the day off from work, and the plan was that David would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions.  David has taken some office space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.  Then we can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), before having our nails done at 4:00.  But again, whatever works best for you.  Just let us know.  --Sally 
 What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Our meeting with EIM is set for Monday, October 12th from 9:00 to 10:30.  Ray Bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with Kevin Sweeney - Ray just initiated that meeting himself with Kevin one day last week, spur of the moment.  But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken place.  I have been working with Kent Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week to arrange our meeting now set for Monday.  I think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.  --Sally 
  The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations.  Just FYI.  I met with Kent Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to Brad, Jenny, and Beth today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has already reviewed Kevin Sweeney's budget for Operations.  Kevin reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and Kent says that Jeff and Ray are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.  --Sally 
  Angela:  Attached please find an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by Enron to honor this year's recipients of the Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  This is our third year to work jointly with many of you in the business school to award these scholarships to outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program. One of the highlights to those of us involved from Enron is the dinner that we host to recognize the students and to renew associations with many of you.  I hope that you will be able to join us at The Josephine House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.  In attendance from Enron will be Rick Causey and me, plus a few others from our senior management team who will be in Austin conducting our on-campus interviews for Enron's Analyst Program.  I will send a final list of attendees by the end of today.    Sally W. Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works, LLC Phone - 713.853.5926 Fax - 713.345.8100 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Per my voice mail, Wanda is still the lead on this initiative.  From our conversation in your office, I had assumed that this would change.  Apparently has not to date.  Rick Buy and I are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour.  My intent had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and to suggest an approach for meeting his objectives.  He has added Wanda, Debbie Brackett, Bill Bradford and David Port to the tomorrow's meeting since our first point of discussion will be a joint project that Rick and I are sponsoring.  Unless he pairs down the group in tomorrow's meeting after our first topic, I doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversation in your office regarding operational risk.  --Sally 
 Is this the staff meeting for next Thursday, October 18th?  I will be here that day.  --Sally 
 What is it that Oxley is looking for in the ENW PRC report that you mentioned? 
 Through Friday, October 12 at 5:00 pm I will be in ECN 2748.  I will move to ECS over the weekend, so if you do not get my packet to me before 5:00 on Friday, please call my assistant (Christina Valdez x39106) to get my new location for Monday. 
 Attached is an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by Enron to honor this year's recipients of the Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  This is Enron's third year to award scholarships to three outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program. One of the highlights to those of us involved from Enron is the dinner that we host to recognize the students.  Dean May will be in attendance, as well as other faculty members from the business school, including Ehud Ronn, Director of UT's Center for Energy Finance and Research.  Since each of you will be in Austin to interview on campus on Tuesday, or will be arriving Tuesday to interview on Wednesday, I hope that you will be able to join us at The Josephine House on Tuesday, October 16 for cocktails at 7:00pm and dinner at 7:30pm.  Please RSVP to me by Friday.  I will send you a complete list of attendees on Monday.  Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 Absolutely, we would enjoy having Angela Dorsey join us for dinner.  I am glad that you made the suggestion.  Please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar, and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well.  Thanks for the congratulations.  Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.  I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.  --Sally 
 I have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever.  I have coordinated with Bob Hall this morning and he will attend the 10:00 meeting in ECN 30C1.  He will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have.  All that I could do at this point is cough and nod!  I could certainly answer any questions for the Euros via e-mail, if needed, over the weekend.  Call me at home (281-370-8568) and I will be glad to do so.  I do expect to be in the office on Monday - hopefully with a voice.  --Sally 
 Can you keep a running list of attendees and RSVP's?  Thanks. 
 Can the travel agency send these things to you?  --Sally 
 I have an ENW budget review meeting with EGM (McConnell and Shankman) set for 1:30 to 2:30 on October 15th. My intent had been to join Rick's meeting at the halfway point at 2:30 under the original schedule.  With the time change of Rick's meeting to a 1:30 start, I will now miss his meeting.  Please let him know that I will be in the budget review meeting with EGM during that time period.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 That would be great if you have time.  If you run out of time, we can wing = it in lavendar.  Thanks.  --Sally=20

 I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.  ENW All-Logistics Meeting Friday, October 12 2:00 to 3:00 PM ECN 5 C-2   Sally W.

 McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.   Staff Meeting Attendees:  Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including Mark's directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.)  Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --Sally 
 I am glad that you will be able to join us.  Yes, we are planning on cocktails first and then dinner.  I am waiting for a response back from Dean May to confirm the time - tentatively set for 7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner.  We can probably either officially slip this schedule back by a half hour to 7:30 and 8:00, or unofficially stretch this to work with your schedule.  We would be happy to have your husband join us as well.  Let me know whether to expect one or both of you. --Sally 
 Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three scholarship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).  Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of "more senior" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.  Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bold above?  --Sally 
 We are looking forward to dinner with you and other faculty members on Tuesday, October 16 as we honor the three students who are the recipients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  We have booked The Josephine House once again.  I wanted to confirm several details with you.  1)  Cocktails at 7:00 pm; Dinner at 7:30 pm  --Do these times work for you?  2)  Last year's invitees from UT included the following: Associate Dean Philip Zerrillo				philip.zerrillo@bus.utexas.edu Assistant Dean Britt Freund				brittf@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Ehud Ronn					eronn@mail.utexas.edu Dr. George Gau					ggau@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Beverly Hadaway					hadawayb@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Linda Golden					mkllg@mail.utexas.edu Mr. Eloy Garcia					eloy.garcia@bus.utexas.edu  Would you like to make any changes or additions to this list for the dinner?  If so, please let me know the changes and appropriate e-mail addresses as necessary.  I will update you later in the week with the list of Enron attendees and the names of the students and their spouses, as applicable.  I look forward to seeing you again at the dinner.  I have enjoyed being involved in the interview process for selecting the scholarship recipients for the last three years, and I especially appreciate the opportunity for Enron and the University to jointly recognize these deserving students.  Please call me with any questions regarding the dinner.  Sally White Beck Chief Operating Officer Enron Net Works LLC  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com 
 Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of = the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one o= f our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mi= d and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured= into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that th= ere could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had s= ecured our first services customer and were to begin providing these servic= es on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during Nov= ember and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much int= erest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people)= , but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enr= on that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to "w= in again" as Enron. =20  Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the= formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts withi= n EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if= we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal s= tage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea wou= ld be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could pro= vide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  Wit= h the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron empl= oyees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this "in= dependent" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estat= e could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon = the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced co= sts for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of th= e CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other = services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that f= or the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true caree= r opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting= firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained. =20  Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There = is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We a= sked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, an= d I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this= .  Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our ho= pe would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around = that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted. =20  The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due dili= gence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consid= eration.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  I= t would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be = followed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit= to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Credit= or's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bid= ding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting fi= rm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process. =20  Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally 
 We would like to honor you as recepients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships at a dinner in Austin on Tuesday, October 16 at The Josephine House at 7:00 pm.  .  Dean May and other members of the staff and faculty of the McComb Business School will be in attendance, as well as several of us from Enron.  We would like to include your spouse, where applicable.  Please send me a return e-mail to let me know if you will be available on October 16.  As soon as I hear back from you, we will finalize details and e-mail an invitation to you with appropriate details.  Feel free to call me as well, if you have any questions.  My direct number at Enron is 713-853-5926 and my home number (best after 7:30 pm) is 281-370-8568.  --Sally 
 This is the memo crafted by Andrew Parsons that was sent to the traders las= t week regarding their back-up spots on the 30th floor of ECN during the re= mainder of the construction in ECS.  You and Greg were copied on the origin= al send of this memo.  --Sally=20 
 Thanks for owning the question and sending me your ideas.  I agree that some sort of planned rotation for experienced hires could be beneficial to the company and to the employees.  I have another week or so of living the 2002 budgets, and then I will be able to do other things!  I am saving your note, and will get in touch with you after that to talk about your ideas in more detail.  I am copying my assistant on this note so that she can schedule a time for us to get together.  --Sally 
 Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.  It was great to see Brent, Bob and Kevin upfront and center.  All of you must have done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend, because the ballroom was full!  A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.  So we have reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.  If a few others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.  Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with Melissa Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retaining Good People.  If you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week.  Golf on Monday, November 19?  Let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.  If you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you, this could be a nice reward.  Did I mention that David is in charge of this tournament?  I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.  Meagan and I will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  I hope that the streets will be ORANGE when I get there.  I will have my cell phone with me, if anything critical comes up.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday.  Have a great weekend!  --Sally 
 Best day is October 26.  Could make October 25 work.  October 24 and November 1 will not work for me.  --Sally Beck 
 Kevin, thanks for getting back to me with names so promptly.  Everyone on the list will be an asset on this effort.  --Sally 
 In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --Sally 
 SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation.  I am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for Project Greenlight.  I have rescheduled a meeting with Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30. I hope that you will be able to attend.  I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting.  I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Monday - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visit.  I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however.  Sally 
    A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.   Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.  Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.  Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.  Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.  Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.  Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.  Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  I.	During regular business hours  A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  -OR-  B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.   II.	After hours  For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed. 
 Thanks, Joannie.  Sorry I didn't see it the first time around!  --Sally

 I participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Center for Houston's Future.  I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the Forum.  I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting, talented members of the Houston community.  I know that I will enjoy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well as collaborating on some "homework" assignments that we will complete between now and then.   I especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on Houston's future through developing both relationships and action steps  through my association with the Center.   Thanks again for making this opportunity available to me.  --Sally Beck 
 The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:  Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.  If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.  Greg Piper Sally Beck Mark Pickering

 I have had my head buried in budgets and am just now coming up for air!  Congratulations on your new role.  With your most recent experience in Investor Relations, I know that you will do a great job in communicating with Enron's Board.  Best of luck in your new role.  --Sally 
 Please check to see which reports will be reviewed in this meeting.  I have forwarded a few to you today to have printed in color.  If there are some reports to be reviewed that we don't have, can you get copies of those for me?  I want to take a look at them before the Oct. 10th meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Can I get a color copy printed?  Thanks.  --Sally 
  Can you get me a color copy of this document?  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  I am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear!  Let's hope for reveral of last year's score.  Hope that 2nd year is going well.  I will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with Dean May and the Enron scholarship winners later in October.  --Sally

 My hot buttons for operations  would be recruiting, career development and resource planning.  Before I simply make assignments, let me canvas my direct reports to be certain that we are assigning those with passion around these areas.  My staff meeting will be tomorrow at 9:00.  I will get back with you on volunteers and also to either reaffirm or alter the hot buttons that I mentioned.  --Sally 
 Thanks, Rosalee.  I have forwarded the information to Jenny Rub with our IT infrastructure group.  --Sally 
 Rick: =20  Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk. = We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involve= d in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objecti= ves.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.= Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's = businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or = is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20  I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list t= o have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complemen= ting, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's = internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being pilot= ed in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA aud= its, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the vario= us operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other = Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate = representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cove= r this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20  I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilit= ies at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quan= tifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impl= ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit= levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implement= ation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-deve= loped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business uni= t/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be form= ed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but m= ay not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiat= ives. =20  Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being add= ressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure t= hat information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate a= nd efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spa= nning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a = steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closel= y with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, res= ource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of = stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in = order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for fina= l input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for D= ebbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed pla= n and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight= when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate= to take this item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cr= oss-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new tea= m to focus on this bullet point. =20  Sally=20 
 UGHHHHH!! 
 Thanks for keeping me posted.  --Sally 
 FYI -Sally=20 
 John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunatel= y occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues= in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify = team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being ha= ndled during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to= your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know th= at everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we hav= e to stay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of y= our team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issu= es that could or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for= a similar role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination= deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify,= it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's p= erformance is impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the inf= rastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Un= ify.  Thanks.  --Sally=20 
 Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.  Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally 
 Thought I'd pass this comment along from Beverly!  --Sally 
 Thanks.  Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.  Lots of time on budgets - still continuing this week.  What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .  Thanks. --Sally 
 Wednesday is out for me, but Thursday, October 18 and Friday, October 19 both work.  I will tentatively hold both days until I hear back from you.  Thanks.  --Sally  Also, great job on organizing the CHF event.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the people I met and the discussion that we had have certainly created a lot of food for thought.  I am in the midst of budgets this week, but will check with you next week on getting our boys together. 
 Please put on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the note and your words of encouragement.  It is exciting to work on something that helps build a strong franchise for Enron.  I appreciate the opportunity of being a part of that.  --Sally 
 Always nice to see positive things.  Thought I'd share this with you.  --Sally 
 These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National Charity League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in Austin for interviews!  --Sally 
 If I were you, I would talk to Wanda and let her know that Ken is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved.  We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with Ken.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with Wanda, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to Dave, Janet and Dan stating that legal has named Wanda as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that Ken must be fully involved - and that you have asked Wanda to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy Wanda on the note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the updates.  When we had the problem with the server resynchronization, did someone from the Infrastructure team alert you ahead of time that they were going to do this during normal business hours, or did you have to be the detective to determine the cause once the problem was at hand.  Let me know. Thanks. --Sally 
 I may have zapped some of these updates from John since he has started this.  May be good in our budget review meeting on Monday with Louise to have all of these updates in hand - and any documentation that you all may have kept on performance issues prior to John starting this update process - as back up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on Unify in 2002 to improve performance and reliability.  Can one of you get all of these updates?  Thanks. --Sally 
 FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new Enron garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.  I have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?  I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Just to keep you up-to-date with the saga... 
 Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a= nd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I= would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside= red in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f= ees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s= hould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon= sor and ENW agree upon. =20  While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still= have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be= tween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E= OL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve= r John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho= c analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric= e accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader= requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th= e request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m= e and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel= ope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting = and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor= k every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu= re success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back= too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded= icated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.= It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage= d operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was= to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su= re that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very = motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe= d as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har= d to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it= is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut= or to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus= e they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, = nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi= ness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k= ind of wonder...=20  I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with= a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi= s role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir= cumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi= ce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe= r costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu= t going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20 
 Anthony:  It's after 5:00 today and apparently the break out by project for ENW IT Development Capital is still outstanding from Rob.  Although we have missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to Dan Leff and Wade Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow.  This is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get one of these packages finished.  Jenny:  Can Ken get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow.  We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, Beth Apollo,  and Anthony by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised packet by afternoon - to Thursday.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.  All of these would be IT applications support.  I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea= ch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this= week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop= le availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc= hedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw= o hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n= ot been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on = that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have= a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th= at Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu= gh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a = religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on = Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget= her.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche= strated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me= eting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com= mitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution = that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.= =20  Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES= budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t= he appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all= of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do= ne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That = is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide= d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest= ed split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec= ision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th= e chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t= ogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer= block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a= t 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t= hat works for both of us. =20  We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that = until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the= components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos= ts and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussio= n.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b= een reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d= iscussion on that.    --Sally=20 
 Thanks so much for your note.  I have assumed my new role as COO right at budget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under Enron Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.  The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!  Your association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.  CIndy is keeping me abreast of your project.  I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you.  While everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in New York.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  --Sally 
 Louise,  To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows:  Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees  Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop, Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA Operations, including Calgary)  Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering, Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)  Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)  3 - 4pm		EB3314		ENW: Operations & IT Dev.	Wes Colwell,Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Sally Beck, Beth Perlman, Mark Pickering, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper, Bob Hall (added-EA 												Operations)  I look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings.  --Sally 
 Yesterday, Wes and I discussed some changes to the timing of ENW budget meetings with Louise this week.  I also confirmed a swap in times on Friday afternoon with Vince Kaminski.  Outlined below are the revised topics and revised attendees.  The date, time and location of meetings on the calendars of  Wes, Faith and Louise remain unchanged - we have simply reorganized and reordered the ENW topics to be covered to facilitate the most beneifical grouping for understanding ENW's expenses.  Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees  Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop, Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA Operations, including Calgary)  Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering, Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)  Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)  3 - 4pm		EB3314		ENW: Operations & IT Dev.	Wes Colwell,Faith Killen, Louise Kitchen,Sally Beck, Beth Perlman, Mark Pickering, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper, Bob Hall (added-EA 												Operations)  I am sending Louise a separate e-mail message regarding the changes.  Wes and Faith:  Locations of the meetings for the above dates and time slots remain as they are on your original schedule.  If the number of attendees per the revised listing above warrants a room change, please let us know.  Otherwise, we will assume that the meetings noted above will take place in the locations noted above.  Call me with any questions.  	--Sally 
 Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest.  With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.  --Sally 
 Was Jim asking questions about the number of employees in ENW who would rem= ain with the Estate? =20 =20 Summary looks good - our meeting with Mike Deville on 2002 budgets is sched= uled for tomorrow.  --Sally 
 Kristin was there - I had to cut it short by a few minutes to meet with Delainey in the other building.,  Kristin stayed for a few more minutes to talk with Jeff and Stacey.  I can give you a more detailed download of all meetings tomorrowl  --Sally 
 Attached is a contact list for Operations, giving home and cell numbers for the Head of Operations for EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS and EEL.  Also listed are the lead risk and settlements personnel for each business unit.  My numbers are listed as well, so feel to call me this weekend if needed.  More detailed contact lists for gas risk, power risk and settlements have been sent to Geoff Storey, as requested by Louise and John.   The IT Help desk (x31411) will be running as usual 24 hours a day.   The Help Desk has appropriate contact numbers for DBA's for all operating systems.  If system problems are encountered, please call the Help Desk.  If potential system problems are not resolved promptly, you can also contact Jenny Rub, VP of IT Infrastructure at 713-851-5456 (cell phone),  281-463-4421(home phone) or  877-345-3812 (pager).

 Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally 
 Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally 
 Do we have this new one? 
 Please schedule a meeting for Thurday afternoon (30 minutes) with Mike DeVille, Kerry Roper, Greg Piper and me to review the operating budgets for 2002, and the impact on the ENW operating budget.  Thanks. 
 Sounds good.  I can be flexible - I will let Christina know to expect a call from your assistant on this.  --Sally 
 Causey concurs with postponing Doorstep reviews.  Haven't heard back from Buy, but I will find him in person this afternoon and will get back with you as soon as I do.  I agree - no need to prepare anything at this point while we are waiting for Buy's response.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Thought that my e-mail message to you last week asked for a moratorium on contacting London re: Doorstep Reviews until I circled back with you after conversations with Buy and Causey.  Sounds as if that moratorium either wasn't communicated or wasn't observed.  Causey left me a voice mail message on Sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all EEL reviews at present.  Still waiting on Buy.  I will find him today. 
 Just heard from Buy - he is in agreement with postponing Doorstep reviews for now.  He has asked me to create a tickler for this in January.  --Sally 
 Some interesting thoughts - many do hit home.  Thought that I would pass th= is along so that we can discuss it when we get together for lunch tomorrow.= --Sally=20 
 Yes, this was to be the review with Corp. - Lay, Whalley and Frevert.  I am= working with Mark LIndsey on the revised schedule - still don't have one, = but I will let you know as soon as I know something.  --Sally 
 Please print the attached on Enron letterhead and fax to Marilou ASAP at The Tremont House.  Thanks! 
 I will include Kerry in this meeting with Mike.  Do you want to attend as well?  Let  me know, and we will schedule it so that it works for you, too.  --Sally 
 Please print on letterhead and fax to Treemont house to Eugene Vaughan.  Thanks. 
 I know that your employees appreciate these meetings.  Thanks for staying so focused!  --Sally 
 Yes, I will be able to attend.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 I will call you on this one...Sally 
 No 
 I am finally making it all the way through old e-mails.  I will try to call you and talk through all of this.  I am probably not as familiar as I should be on the procedures that exist.  --Sally 
 What are the plain facts around this Rexam deal?  --Sally 
 Here are contact numbers for Steve:  Work	512-427-3307  Cell	512-431-7739  I will see you tomorrow at 9:30.  --Sally 
 The November newsletter looked great!  This message was sent by Beverly Gibson for the December newsletter.  At Monday's board meeting, Lori Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  Lori also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that.  --Sally

 Big Pig:  Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?   UBS:  Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI. 
 Please join Greg Piper and me for an ENW Management Team meeting at 8:30 am in Conference Room # 4990 on the fourth floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, November 8.

 Please print on legal paper and let's discuss.  Thanks. 
 Exciting news on the house, but I know that you must be busy!  When we moved to Champion Forest, we did the same thing.  Called the real estate agent to list our house on a Monday, got a contract on our house on Tuesday, and put a contract on our new house on Wednesday that week.  You and your husband must be into quick decision making as well!!  Yes, life at Enron is interesting these days.  Kind of like a soap opera.  Difficult for everyone to stay focused.  We are ready for some good news here.  With your move, let me know how I can help more with this December newsletter.  It is on my list for the weekend to recreate Lori Ewalt's article as a word attachment and get that to you.   I am glad that you have the permission slip in hand.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your help.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Spoke to Allen - this outage will not take place this weekend and is tentatively rescheduled for the weekend of November 17.  The feasibility of that timing will be re-evaluated at the end of next week.  --Sally 
  FYI - no move to the new building this week.  --Sally 
 Thanks so much for your note.  It is certainly nice to know that your thoughts are with me.  I, too, enjoyed visiting with you at our Woodlands session.  I was so sorry to miss the second forum, but I certainly feel that I made the right decision to be here.  When some of this is behind us at Enron, I do hope to get reconnected with the on-going efforts resulting from the CHF.  --Sally 
 Please print for me.  Highly confidential - cannot be discussed yet.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Mark received a payment in late November that stated that it would have to be repaid in full if he leaves Enron before the end of February 2002.  How do we handle this?  Has Mark mentioned this repayment?  --Sally 
 Contact numbers are listed below for Greg Piper and me if needed over the weekend.  Mark Pickering is out of the country, and we are coordinating with him as we complete scenarios on reduced costs.  Our team is continuing to work on this tonight and we will reconvene in the office starting at 8:00 am on Saturday.

 Everyone worked hard and did a good job on Friday night and Saturday.  From IT, Jenny Rub, Steve Stock, Iain Greig, Anthony Dayao and Ramesh Rao were very engaged and did some great work.  Jeff Johnson was kept updated while in route back to Houston and he is in the office today reviewing the work that has been done to date.  Other ENW team members hard at work with us over the weekend have been Bob Hall, Beth Apollo, Kevin Sweeney, Kerry Roper and Marla Barnard.  Greg P. and I met with Kerry Roper this am to review the summarized version of the work that has been done.  Looks good - and it is unlikely that we will get with Greg Whalley to review the data this weekend.  He's meeting with commercial teams currently, and then will be on a plane for NYC later today.  We will take tomorrow to incorporate any changes that Jeff Johnson may have, and to get the entire weekend team to review and affirm (or change) the data as it is now summarized.  I will e-mail Greg W. an update on the work that we have done today and will copy you on that message.  Greg P. and I decided not to e-mail the details to him - better to review in person.  He will know that we are ready.  Quick preview of Monday's intended schedule:  8:00 am		All direct reports of OOC of ENW will meet in Conference Room 4175 in ECS to view together the web-cast of Dynegy conference call  9:00		Following webcast, Greg P., Marla Barnard and I will meet with OOC direct reports to review Q&A and to talk about next steps  9:30		I will meet briefly with weekend team to go over work needed on Monday re: cost saving measures  10:00		The start of a whirlwind series of floor meetings to reach all ENW employees (have the details mapped out - attached is copy of 			spreadsheet)  4:00		Regroup with weekend team to review data revised during the day on cost saving measures  5:00		Greg P. is buying...  Outstanding item on cost savings efforts:  We didn't include or touch the ISC.  Their budget for 2002 is included in Corp., but since responsibility now rests with you, we need to get Allan involved in the same exercise that we worked over the weekend.  Would you like for me to meet with him on Monday to get him started?  Then you can take it from there?  Or would you like to wait and address this with Allan when you are back in the office?  Just let me know.  Have a good flight back.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do for you tomorrow while you are in route back to Houston.  --Sally 
 Thanks - this will be a BIG effort, I know.  --Sally

 Please join Greg Piper and me in Conference Room 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS at 8:00 am on Monday, November 12.  To find this conference room, go through the security badge check point to your right as you arrive on the 4th floor, then make a left at the first hallway and the conference room will be on your right.  Dynegy and Enron will simulcast a merger conference call live via the Internet at 8:00 am Central Time.  We will access this webcast via the two large screens in the conference room.  We can watch this together as a group, and at the conclusion of the simulcast we will have a brief meeting to discuss Q&A regarding the merger and our action steps for the day as the management team of Enron Net Works.  I look forward to seeing you on Monday morning.  --Sally 
 Talked with Jenny - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.  I looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.  Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew. Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.  Have sent e-mail notice of meeting - included Tony Mends and Allan Sommer since I don't know Paskin's whereabouts and I do know that Mark Pickering won't be here.  Otherwise, Tony and Allan will be out of the loop.  Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?  I will also leave voice mail messages on everyone's Enron extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.  Brent is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.  Not sure that McConnell will meet with Greg W.   Brent will update me after the 3:00 meeting.  --Sally 
 We are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return from New York to review projected cost savings from ENW.  For each business unit that we support (EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS), we have prepared cost savings on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below.  Scenario 1:	Enron exits the line of business, with immediate headcount reductions and cost savings quantified; skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business; then final headcount reductions and cost savings quantified (Lights Out)  Scenario 2:	Enron retains and maintains line of business, but does not invest for growth; assumes no further systems enhancements; support is scaled back from current level and is minimal (Lights On - But Dim)  Scenario 3:	Enron retains line of business and invests modestly to accommodate known market changes; service levels are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal (Lights On - Brighter)  Cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following level of detail by commodity for EGM and EIM:  EGM:	Freight Markets					EIM:	Forest Products FX/IR/Equity						Steel Domestic Crude & Products International Crude & Products Domestic Coal International Coal  Cost savings have been identified for ENW's unallocated expense and capital as well.  We have worked with HR to adjust cost savings for anticipated severance costs.  --Sally  713-853-5926 sally.beck@enron.com  Cell	713-417-1591 Home	281-370-8568 
 Up to you and Anthony.  We have already done a meeting in 3AC - today at 11:15.  We had not been provided info that Anthony had anyone in 3AC.  We had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans - I don't think that Anthony was able to attend.  Your options are to bring them over to ECN 14 at 1:30, or to have them attend a meeting at 1:00 in 2 Allen Center, 12 th floor in the Forum (a meeting room on that floor). I will be conducting that floor meeting at 1:00 for ENW employees in 2 Allen Center - it is Allan Sommers' ISC group.  --Sally 
  Can you update me today on status, issues and resolution?  We need to get back with Bill Bradford today.  --Sally 
 Great - I  will look forward to seeing you next week.  --Sally 
 Mike:  Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?  Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.  --Sally 
 This problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and RPS and RGS.  My understanding is that Todd Taylor on your team is working on this interface.  What is the expected completion of this interface, and if is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.  With the large number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem.  Can you call me today with an update?  Thanks. -Sally 
 James responded and filled me in on the issue.  Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems.  How are we going to clean up the existing backlog?  Did you know that this had grown so large?  James says that this sits in Shelly Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by Shelly.  Bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.  (Don't worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we can manage this better. 
 These counterparties are set up in GCP; however, they have not been set up in RPS and RGS.  Two things are needed.  First, we need an automated link from GCP to RPS and RGS.  Someone on Anthony Dayao's team is assigned to this, but the project has not been completed.  I have asked Anthony to update me today on how we can get this completed ASAP.  This will solve the problem on a go-forward basis.  The second need is a clean up effort on this backlog.  I have asked Beth Apollo for an update on her plan, and I will have her review this with you later today. --Sally 
 SInce your name was not on the original list, I am forwarding this to you.  Molly's comment that "many lack the clear understanding ..." in the third paragraph below - to whom does this apply and do you agree with her?  --Sally 
 Tom,  Thanks for the list of questions.  I am always glad when someone takes me up on that type of offer, because I genuinely want the input from others.  I have taken a quick glance at the list of questions and will take the time to read them thoroughly over a sandwich today.  After reading them, I will get back to you on an effective way to answer them, as I may not be able to personnally address all.  --Sally 
 As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.   We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.  The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning).  Mark Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon. He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have.  We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite".  There is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day.  The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend.  --Sally 
 In case you have your blackberry with you while in line with the masses, just learned from Brent Price (via Mike McConnell) that there is a daily meeting led by JIm Fallon with CEO's at 11:00 that reviews cash usage within the businesses and where a list, although not final, is being reviewed relative to lines of business and locations (i.e. Tokyo, Singapore, etc.) that may be exited.  It is key for ENW to anticipate these changes and seems that we could add something to the discussions from time to time.  Did you know about this meeting?  Seems like you should be there.  Can you nose in with Jim?  --Sally 
  Carol:  Would you enlarge the attachment so I can print for Sally.  Thanks,  Christina 
 Who was this who replied? 
 Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an Enron conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.  It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.  Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --Sally  Just thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the "ibuyit" and "ibuyit-payables" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures. 
 What are our communications with terminated employees and are there adminis= trative obstacles impacting them as the note below would indicate?    If th= ere is a backlog of info regarding employee status, I will be happy to key = punch to get caught up.   I am trainable and very willing!!!  --Sally=20 
 As discussed during yesterday's 5:00 pm meeting, the ENW direct reports to the Office of the Chair (VP level only) will meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss employee talent.  The meeting will be in Conference Room # 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS from 1:00 to 4:00 pm.  Please respond only if you are unable to attend.  Information to be discussed in this meeting should be submitted to Marla Barnard today.  Thanks for you time and attention to this.  --Sally 
 Yes, fully prepared.  Thanks.  --Sally  Have a great time on vacation.  Relax and enjoy the family.  Say hello to Jo for me. 
 Employees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly.  We want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing Enron's business.  HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.  The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.  That process is slated for February, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that.  I am happy to answer your questions.  Feel free to send me others as the come up.  --Sally 
  Attached is list of questions.  How soon could we have answers to these?  I would appreciate any help that you could give me on this.  --Sally 
 I will be in the office on Tuesday next week (November 21), but hope to take the day off on Wednesday.  The kids will be out of school on Wednesday and we are going to Austin to be with my family for Thanksgiving.  So we hope to be on the road on Wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic.  With that, sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on Monday, November 26.  If you want to try and talk before then, a good time to get me is in car during my morning commute.  Number is 713-417-1591, and some range between 7:00 am and 8:30 am might work.  These are certainly trying times.  You have been in my thoughts, and you have my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight, out of mind.  --Sally 
 Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley
