 us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.  Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.  There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.  The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes. You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:  Business Unit HR Contact Phone# EGM  David Hill 713/853-4218 EIM Kathy Neal 713/345-7803 EA/Global Services Frank De Jesus 713/345-3662 EA/Global Services Hector McLoughlin 713/853-6703  Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services. 
 Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.  Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I will be glad to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that you can bring. We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!) 
 Gwynn,  Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something - if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.  Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and commodity operations.  Patti x39106 
 FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly. --Sally 
 Please approve. 
 I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL. Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc. Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:  1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and their status, or  2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week. 
 Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks. 
 We will get you back on the official distribution list.  For now, I am forwarding our weekly report to you.  --Sally 
 I would like to have my directors and senior directors take this course. = =20 There is just one course date noted in the attachment in May.  Will there b= e=20 other dates during the year?

 Good response, Bob.  Thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting.  --Sally 
 FYI - See attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the "ill-defined".  If this is not on target, we will keep working until it is!  - Sally 
 All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally 
 I have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by London.  Do you have a hard copy that I can see?  I can get it from you during the Risk Forum luncheon today.  Thanks. 
 Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall. But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally 
 Bob,  Sally is out all day w/ UT recruiting function.  She will not be back into the office until 8:00 Thursday for CommodityLogic meeting.  I am forwarding this to Bob Hall - please check with him regarding how he would like this handled.  Thanks, PT 
 In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic.  Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist  User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements  Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic  NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations) ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations)   Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price. Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.  In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic. I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic. 
 Thanks for your list.  I will add these to our Hot List.  Let me know about the A/R.  Thanks.  Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.  --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 03/26/2001 01:54 PM 
 FYI - sounds as if Michelle is accepting.  Do you have anything firm from her?  --Sally 
 FYI  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one. 
 Frank & Hector,  Here is the list of contractors that Kymberly sent Sally - please compare to list from Peggy McCurley that Sally gave you last week.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I am so glad that you will be able to interview.  I will look forward to seeing you in Austin on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron. --Sally 
 Bob & Leslie,  Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your availability.  2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.  I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 2nd meeting.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Please print for me.  Thanks. 
 I will be in New York on business on March 30th.  Sorry that I will not be able to attend.  The other person that I would send in my place is Beth Apollo.  However, she will be on vacation next week.  Can you give me any info that may be made available?  Thanks. 
 Hi Dierdre,  I got your name from Christie Patrick as a contact for the Columbia Women in Business Conference.  Sally Beck will be attending in place of Christie Patrick.  Can you forward me exact address of conference site so I can include on Sally's itinerary.  I read in your note to Christie that you would be sending invitation w/ directions and address - can you send me a copy also?  If not by e-mail, is it something that can be faxed? My fax number is 713-345-8100.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sally is excited about participating in your conference and looks forward to meeting you.  Patti Thompson Sally Beck's Assistant 713-853-9106 patti.thompson@enron.com 
 FYI - 
 Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the response to the RFP went to CMS?  Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you have that.  You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was only part of the package.  I would like to see the whole thing.  Thanks. 
 I didn't search this long list of addressees to see if you were included.  In case this is going only to Peggy, I thought that I would forward this since she is still on vacation.  --Sally 
 Have you heard any more about this?  I didn't see it on my calendar.  This does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe.  Maybe Philippe will cancel that.  Let me know.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Murray,  Sally Beck and Leslie Reeves are both on vacation this week.  Sally will need to discuss this with Leslie next week when they return to the office and get back with you then.  Patti Thompson (x39106), Sally's Assistant 
 FYI per my longer e:mail update message... 
 I got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon.  Thought I would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things.  Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely with James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort. Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations. Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments.  Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work. I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an Enron job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday of another risk book administrator from Portland.)  Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale. End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.) Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out. 
 Meant to copy you on this note.  I will either see you on Thursday next week, or on Monday the 19th.  --Sally 
 I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details. They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible. 
 Thanks for the note.  I will definitely look for you in San Antonio.  I would love to hear about your new role.  We miss seeing you in ENA.  (I guess that is now Enron Americas!)  --Sally 
 I will be on vacation the week of March while my children are on Spring Break.  We will be out of town Monday through Wednesday, looking at colleges with Meagan.  We should return to Houston on Wednesday night.  I have planned to be out of the office for the balance of the week, but may decide to return to work on Thursday and Friday.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me while I am out of town in case something urgent arises.  I will also let her know during the week whether or not I will be back at work on Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, the following persons are key contacts:  Commercialization of Services:  James Scribner   x39641 Beth Apollo   x35014  Enron Americas Operations:   Gas:  Bob Hall   x36956 Jeff Gossett   x37306  Power:  Stacey White  x31870  Enron Global Markets Operations:  Brent Price    x37647  Enron Industrial Markets Operations: Brenda Herod   x35778  Enron Europe Operations:   Mike Jordan   7830-34703  Global Services:     Beth Apollo   x35014 
 I will be out of the office on vacation the week of March 12.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have contact numbers for me if you need to reach me while I am out on vacation.  Below are the key Operations Contacts for Enron Americas for the week of March 12:   Gas Operations    Jeff Gossett   x37306 Bob Hall   x36956  Power Operations   Stacey White   x31870  DPR      Shona Wilson  x39123 Chris Abel   x33102  MPR      Shona Wilson  x39123 
 Buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume.  Please print for me and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my outbox).  I will need to review them when I am back.  Thanks. 
 FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this along.  --Sally 
 Thought you might like to see this note from Max on the doorstep review in Monterrey.  Beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact already.  --Sally 
 I think that this sounds like a good plan.  Since Michelle, Clay and Nadege are still pending on their fulltime offers, this should help us in the cultivation effort.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I was promoted effective February 1, 2001 to Managing Director of Global Risk Management Operations for Enron Corp. in Houston.  In this role I manage all mid and back office services for all commodities markets within Enron's wholesale businesses: Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Europe.  I received my BBA from UT-Austin in 1975 and my MBA in 1977.  My maiden name while attending school was Sally White. 
 Wes' memo finally went out to Sherriff.  DPR won't change at this point in time.  --Sally 
 Cindy had to change lunch to March 30, which conflicts with Bob Shults. I moved Cindy to March 30th- can you try to move my lunch with Bob to March 28th?  Thanks.  (FYI, CIndy's last names has only "O's" in it - Olson and Bob's last name has only "S's" - no "Z".) 
 Yes, I can make March 30th work.  I will put that on my calendar.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you.  We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports.  Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These were "on the side" and not captured in total power exposure because they didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review). If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence to these. 
 Great follow through!  Thanks for managing the doorstep process in Mexico so that Max and his team saw that as a plus for them.  Perfect approach and outcome.  --Sally 
 I will be out on vacation next week while my kids are on spring break.  I will make the next meeting.  --Sally 
 I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took the follow up Communications program in 2000.  Is this another program that you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the program?  Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 1999 and 2000.  Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.  --Sally 
 Thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended.  These are interesting, and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in Dallas.  Please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the subject.  I will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying to "size" the market for our services and get that out to all attendees within the next week or so.  --Sally 
 Still checking kids schedules at home for the 19th.  I will let you know tomorrow.  --Sally 
 I suspect that you meant to include Bob Hall, the VP that reports to me, on this mailing list.  His assistant (Heather Choate) is included in your mailing list.  The "Robert L Hall at ET&S" to whom this is addressed is not Bob Hall in Networks who reports to me.  You should address this to "Bob Hall" - if you do this the e:mail address should pop us as Bob M Hall/NA/Enron.   Thanks.  --Sally 
 Unfortunately, these new dates don't work for me.  My children's spring break is next week, March 12-16,  I will be out of the office that week on vacation, taking my own daughter to look at colleges!  --Sally 
 Please get with Tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements for Greg's approval.  If Tina and Greg are not yet using the online format, then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for him.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally 
 Please print the attachment for me in color.  Thanks. --Sally 
 You have the right Sally Beck.  I grew up around the corner from your dad and used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) with Jim and the whole family.  Plus your mom and I used to spend the night at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.  I had heard through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.  I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.  Call my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get together.  Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.  I look forward to seeing you.  By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing Beck.   --Sally 
 Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.   I will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by the end of this week.  For your planning purposes, I will be available to interview at UT during the week of March 26.  Best days for me are Tuesday, March 27 and Thursday, March 29.  I can make other days work as well.  For the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 or 19th.  Hope this helps.  If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients on campus.  --Sally 
 I was out of the office Friday and Monday - just back today.  I am having to rearrange some things that Mary was focused on.  I will get back with you later today and let you know who the best contact person will be.  --Sally 
 Please keep this number handy just in case.  Thanks. 
 Was this memo just to inform me of this meeting, or did you cc me to invite me to the meeting?  I am not available on March 9th from 12:00 to 1:00.  Does this meeting pertain only to IT personnel?  If so, I will ignore this.  If you did want someone from my group to attend, let me know and I will ask an appropriate person to attend.  --Sally     Khymberly Booth @ ENRON 03/02/2001 02:50 PM 
 Any feedback or interest?  Please let me know.  --Sally 
 We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very fruitful trip for the team. Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements. They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare). The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!  I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines sometime.  I had a lot of fun.  The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of the moms who were chaperoning as well.  But it was nice to get back to Houston yesterday. 
 Thanks for the update.  Good to know that the current due date still looks likely - always give or take a week or so!  I have just returned from drill team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!  First place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance, and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and presentation.  Keep me posted on baby news!! --Sally 
 Since Sally is out of the office today, March 5 and will be out next Monday, March 12, the OpRisk Forum Luncheon has been cancelled for both dates. Please adjust your calendars accordingly.  The 10:00 AM staff meeting, however, will be held as usual.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Approved for Patti Thompson. Sally Beck  XMS (Expense Management System)  For New Users Session Dates & Times: 03/02/2001  1:00:00 PM-4:00:00 PM Location: EB3321 No Show/Participant Fee: $ 135.00 
 An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:  Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified  I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort.  Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business  I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. 
 Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it will be loud, but fun.  --Sally 
 Shona and Mike Jordan had talked last week about pushing back the Doorstep review on the metals business in London and had agreed to take that out of the plan for Q1.  As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.  I have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach.  Beth is in fact in Monterrey, Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.  Soon after she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule.  After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.  With Beth's knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews. 
 I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will check messages at the end of both business days.  My assistant, Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.  Since I will be a chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily reachable during the day.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6. 
 I made the decision last week to disband the Strategic Initiatives team which reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services.  As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the respective business sponsors/end users.  The "middle-man" role played by the Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.  I wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re-deployment effort. 
 Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs. With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, etc.  If my reaction had been to say "what a talented group - we have to figure out how to best utilize them", then the outcome might have been different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally 
 I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value proposition.  As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team. To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end users.  Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week. Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks. Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough decision, I feel comfortable having made it. 
 As part of the modelling process, Marc is going to meet with James Scribner on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am to review our operations pricing model.  If you can join them, you might find it interesting.  They plan to meet in James' office - EB3756.  --Sally 
 Saturday was fun - it was nice I think for all of us to go to the shower together.  That was a nice group of women - and fun.  Cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and I think that it sounds good. Tell me what I can do to help you, but I am probably shorter on time than anything.  But if I can get you get addresses or whatever, let me know.  Payment plan sounds fine.  I am not worried about the timing on that, so don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family. With the Viviance thing, you may prefer to defer the start of this until a little more certainty is on the horizon.  I can't think of a better place for the money to be invested than in you and your family.  Austin would be fun - but I am glad that Houston is a reasonable distance for a day or weekend trip.  Not quite the same as being in town, though.  Maybe someday we will be there!  --Sally 
 As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).  Louise is now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.  Philippe has assumed the role as chairman of Enron Net Works.  Since this report is a Net Works report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and Peggy effective immediately.  Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals section each week before distribution.  What would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?  --Sally

 Marc,  Unfortunately, today is not going to work for the revenue model for mid & back office services meeting.  How about this coming Monday, Feb 26 from 1:00 - 2:30 pm?  I have penciled in that time for Sally, Mary Solmonson & James Scribner.  Please let me know if that will work for you.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Laurel,  FYI, Sally will only be available on Monday and 1/2 day of Thursday (AM). She has business travel Tuesday & Wednesday, and vacation 1/2 Thursday and Friday.  Patti 
 Thanks for your note. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  The promotion did get the year off to a nice start.  I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.  While time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.  Keep me posted on what you are doing.  --Sally 
 Thanks for much for your nice note.  Where are you working now?  I hate to say that I have lost track.  --Sally 
 This is the replacement meeting for the Hot List meeting.  I have asked that you be included on the list of attendees.  --Sally 
 Brenda Herod is in charge of Energy Operations for EIM and should be included in the invitation list.  Brent Price fulfills two roles for EGM - CAO and head of operations, so he is appropriately included covering both fronts. Also, I had added Bob Hall to the previous Hot List meeting.  He is a VP in Energy Operations for Enron Americas.  I would like for him to be on the list for this meeting as well.  He and I will cover for each other on this Wholesale Deal Meeting.  You may get both of us in attendance on occassion, but usually it will be one or the other of us to cover operations for EA. Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Looks like a permanent cancellation to me - at least for now!  We can work with Wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact Enron Americas. 
 Thanks, Marc.  I would like to get together with you, Mary  Solmonson and James Scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high, low and expected cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office services.  Mary has just returned today from a week's vacation.  I will work on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a kick-off meeting.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  It has been a nice way to start the year!  --Sally 
 I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would forward it to you.  Does it make sense?  $8MM in equipment charges for us???????  Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?  Can you give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" line?  What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you and Kristin are getting together. --Sally 
 E:mail messages says to check website to determine whether or not DSL is available at my home.  However, I don't see a spot on the website to check that information.  Can you provide more details? 
 Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well. despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits.  So do approach this as fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made.  Looks like a good group.  I hope that all will attend and participate.  Did Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know this date and time works for everyone?  Keep me posted on progress.  --Sally 
 I need your help with a quick survey of how many interns you'd like to have this year.  Sally needs to forward this number to Rick Causey by noon tomorrow.  Please send me your rough count by 11:30 AM (Wednesday).  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Depending on others' schedules, Feb. 23 is good for me.  I will be out of the office on March 2.  --Sally 
 I am looking forward to involvement with the NABA and the prospect of hiring some strong candidates.  If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 looks good.  I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in Dallas.  With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!  It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.  Let's definitely plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.  I just checked the calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!  A few weeks away, but at least it is on the calendar!  If your schedule were to free up suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have lunch sooner.  --Sally 
 Please change location of this meeting for this week only.  I would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to ENW Staff Meeting with Philippe with Peggy McCurley as the contact.  Thanks. 
 You and Frank can best decide how to organize this.  I am comfortable with your decisions, so feel free to go ahead with this.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Don't I know...they are smart and loving, but a little short on the details sometimes, aren't they!  --Sally 
 Save the date note would be great if you can do that.  --Sally 
 TJ,  Sorry, please disregard last email - I did not see this follow-up notice. Unfortunately, Sally is not available on Thursday either - she will be at the Enron Management conference in San Antonio Thursday & Friday.  All Enron VP's are invited (Cassandra & Kevin?).  Please call & I can give you Sally's available time if she needs to attend.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting yours, so I would be glad to do so.  I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward to good use.  --Sally 
 Thanks for lining this up.  I am glad that they were available on the 2nd. --Sally 
 Please process this request ASAP.  Thanks, Sally Beck 
 Please print attachment for me.  Thanks. 
 I will be at a meeting in Dallas next Monday and will be unable to attend. --Sally 
 Thanks for your vote of confidence.  I don't think that it is out of the realm of possibility.  As we know with all Enron reorg's, what we can count on is that this will change!  We'll miss Delainey in Enron Americas, but as a shareholder I am glad that he will be at EES.  Have already had some discussions with him about some involvement there.  I will keep you posted.  --Sally 
 Wouldn't it be the four of us?  - You, me, Cara and baby to be named?  Good idea.  I'll call you this weekend.  Sorry didn't reply earlier - was in Calgary. --Sally 
 Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test - i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash. Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created.  These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps:  1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.  2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in making information and personnel available to complete the review.  3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested. This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so.  5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items. Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly.  Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me. In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to "over-wordsmith" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process. 
 I will be working in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be reached.  I will be back in the Houston office on Friday, February 9.  Key contacts in Houston over the next two days are:  DPR   Chris Abel    x33102  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations Bob Hall    x36956 Jeff Gossett    x37306  Power  Leslie Reeves   x37962 Operations  Stacey White    x31870 
 Please change this on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 I know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the TX RRCommission earlier this year.  I suspect this is a result of that.  Brenda Herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the TRRC.  If she hasn't already told  you about that meeting, you may to visit with her on that.  --Sally 
 Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here.  Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.  I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him.  I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30.  Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews. Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg.  Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation.  That's great to have dinner with Lou.  I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way.  Are they on an Enron network?  Do they get Enron e:mails?  How often does Lou go to London or someone from London mid office come to New York?  I still suspect that New York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to chew on in London.  Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business.  Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.  They tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing.  It snowed there a lot yesterday.  Of course, according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy in Calgary.  I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.  --Sally 
 Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York office.  It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York. Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost that way.  This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals. If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally

 Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime tempurature reading!).  I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally 
 FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over the change in reporting for him.  I gave his review the end of last week, but didn't get to review the reporting change.  I will ask Patti to let you know when I am meeting with James on Friday.  Wanted you to be in the loop on this - particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, I want this to be well done.  The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training.  Looks like he still has some homework to do. --Sally 
 Please print memo and attachment for me to review on the plane tomorrow. Thanks.  --Sally 
 Please put Mike on my calendar for Thursday lunch next week. Steve and Richard are coming as well.  You might tell Mike that we can provide the two of them with desk space as well, but that we will reserve the spot with the computer and phone for Mike.  And schedule some time for me to meet with him on Thursday as well.  I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way.  You might e:mail Mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with computer, network connection and phone on 33.  You might also offer to set up any appointments for him while is here.  Thanks. 
 No memo out yet on the Doorstep process.  I am still in the throws of completing the 13 reviews that I have to give - should be finished by 5:00. I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown before I leave for the day.  I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom and her team.  Back in the Houston office on Friday.  Hope that James' visit is going well.  Thanks for getting appointments organized for him.  I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.  I am glad that you, Richard and Steve will be able to participate.  Are you still planning to come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?  I fly from Dallas to Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for summer interns on Wednesday.  I will be back in the office on Thursday and Friday that week.  Let me know if we can help in setting up any appointments.  We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule allows.  I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas meeting and to follow up on some other issues.  I would offer dinner on Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family will have dinner plans for me that evening.  Is there someone else in Houston that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?   --Sally 
 Please note time and location for Promotion Luncheon for Managers:  Location: EB 32C2 Time: 11:30 AM Date:  Today, Tuesday, February 6, 2001  We look forward to seeing you there.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 I will not be able to attend.  -Sally 
 Good memo.  I will be curious to see if you get any comments or response from the commercial guys.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the info.  I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow. Despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge, I am trying to do two lunches this week - one with operations personnel promoted to manager (about 15 of those) and one with operations personnel promoted to director or senior director (smaller group).  To make this work while the promotion announcements are still timely, we have had to schedule on Tuesday this week for one of the lunches.  I will get an update from Shona. 
 Thanks for the weather report.  I bought a good coat a couple of months ago with London and Calgary in mind.  Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc.  I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.  If it would be good for you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early supper.  (If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by alcohol.  I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and outside work - either way will work well for me.    --Sally     Peggy Hedstrom 02/05/2001 04:19 PM 
 Please print Wellesley schedule - I think that I have a conflict with the date that they need me.  Let's discuss. 
 Please print the attachment at end of e:mail in color for me.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Have you seen the training tools that Avril uses for such things?  --Sally 
 I will be in Calgary Wednesday and Thursday this week.  Tuesday is tough, because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews.  I can make time on Tuesday, but would prefer that we hold this to an hour.  --Sally 
 I had the same reaction.  We didn't get much of a break between the January and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned her husband as a possible "expert" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls before I leave.  On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work. Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally 
 FYI 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Manager.  Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Brenda Herod and I would like to invite you to a luncheon in recognition of your promotion on Tuesday, February 6.  We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business.  We would like the opportunity to help you celebrate your promotion.  Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).  Details on time and location will follow.  --Sally 
 Brent Price, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves and I would like to invite you to lunch on Friday, February 9 in recognition of your promotions to Director and Senior Director.  We appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of Enron's wholesale services business and feel that these promotions are worthy of celebration.  Please RSVP to Patti Thompson (x39106).  Details on time and location will follow.  --Sally 
 I couldn't agree with you more.  Mike missed the point of our phone call this week.  It was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette!  The point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed.  And how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for US operations that Mike's response was a deferral to Marcelo.  I have a one-hour conference call set up with Mike tomorrow.  This is one of the things that we will discuss.  --Sally 
 I will be in the Calgary office with Peggy Hedstrom and her team next week on Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  Do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that I could handle while I am in Calgary?  My agenda with Peggy and her team is pretty full, but I can add to that anything that you know of that we need to address.  Just let me know.  That puts me in Calgary for the staff meeting on Wednesday.  I will sit in with Rob Milnthorp on the video conference for the first hour of the meeting.  I already had a meeting scheduled with all of Peggy's team during the second hour of your staff meeting.  Due to location constraints, we will have to keep that meeting as scheduled.  So I will have to step out of the staff meeting for the second hour. 
 Seattle sounds nice.  Haven't made it there myself.  Enjoy the trip.  If you have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts about next steps for Joel's team.  --Sally  Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.  We are addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems work. 
 In my new role as social secretary for James, I wanted to let you know that he will be in London next week on business.  He will arrive on Monday morning (February 5) and should be in the Enron office  most of the day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  He will fly back to Houston on Thursday.  He has dinner plans for Wednesday evening, but would love to get together with you for dinner on Monday or Tuesday, if you are in town and available.  He will be staying at the Sheraton Belgravia Hotel - walking distance to Enron House.  Best way to contact him at Enron's London office would be through Mike Jordan or his assistant.  Mike's number (don't know how many of these digits you actually need to call from there) is 011-44-207-783-4703.  Hope you guys get to see each other.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you.  Her role has changed once again at  Enron!   She is running more of a fundamentals group at present.  Wanted to know if you would be interested in that.  Told her that I couldn't speak for you.  I'd suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest.  Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her.  You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know more and she will know you.  FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.  --Sally 
 I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with adorable pictures at all times?! --Sally 
 Enjoy a well-deserved afternoon off.  I appreciate your notes when you are out on who to contact.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally 
 Just a quick note to see how you are doing.  I mentioned your name today to Kristin Albrecht.  She is a Senior Director over Risk Management for Enron Broadband Services (EBS).  Kristin and I used to work together in Enron Americas, and we had lunch today to catch up.  She grew up in Wharton and is an A&M graduate, so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things in common.  I wanted you to know that I have given Kristin your name.  She can be another contact for you here at Enron.  If you are interested in what is going on at EBS or want to get Kristin's impressions on rotations within or outside EBS, she would be great for you to visit with.  Drop by soon to give me an update on life at Enron for you.  --Sally 
 Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around "energy" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron.  Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for Burlington Resources.  I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program. His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your time.  Thanks.  --Sally   x35926

 Here is the info on the meeting in Dallas.  I am glad that you will be able= =20 to join us. --Sally=20 
 I will call you tonight! 
 Thanks for your help on getting Chris Hanz lined up to talk with Chris Hoyle.  If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about it.  I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team. _Sally 
 I agree - he does look like a good candidate.  Please do go ahead with a phone screen and let me know if we should then interview him.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please put the dates referenced below on my calendar.  You may need to get more details from Lexi.  Thanks. 
 Watch for her call.  Ask her to send me a resume to review and set up a meeting when convenient.  Thanks. 
 I will look forward to talking with Norma.  Thanks for suggesting that she contact me. --Sally 
 Can you upgrade me to first class? 
 This looks great.  Do you need me for either of those two dates?  How was dinner last night?   Sorry that I couldn't stay, but I know that the students were in good hands.  Who else attended from Enron?  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI - The details below take care of the Hess "sharing arrangement" that we discussed yesterday.  --Sally 
 Glad to hear that we are getting there.  Josephine's House (Jeffery's annex) is really good.  They do a great job of serving.  At past Enron dinners, they have printed menus specific for the occassion - really nice looking and a nice keepsake.  Maybe we can do this.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I do believe that this indicates a recognition within the organization of the importance of the work of the whole group.  That is nice to see!!--Sally 
 She will check with Dad and let you know?????  I don't quite get all of this either.  Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a plan?  (Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the occassion.)  Who knows...  Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that too.  --Sally 
 I do know Jana.  She has worked in various positions within my group for years since she joined us in the analyst program.  She has not been the strongest player.  Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and settlements).  And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it.  She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.  Let me check with Scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an HR role.  I will let you know what he thinks.  It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right role for her.  If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree.  Very sweet, pleasant to work with and personable.  I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or I may have him leave you a message. 
 FYI - Check my voice mail message that I left for you and call me when you can. 
 Not sure that this reached you the first time.  My address was flawed. 
 Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds. Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too many in one room and bathroom.  I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd? 
 I hear that Dad was in the emergency room for some hours earlier this week. Glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus.  Mom does seem to like that Heart Hospital...  Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -  a lot better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.  It looks pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!  Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air. Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.  I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.  Hope all is well with the three of you.  Are you making the trip to Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?  I am not going to make it - need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes!!  Love, Sally 
 Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.  What a pretty name!  I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.  I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that you are probably a bit sleep deprived.  That will pass - although with your first one that is really hard to believe.  Please stop by as soon as you have pictures.  I would love to see them.  --Sally 
 Melissa Allen, formerly with Arthur Andersen and assigned to the Enron account, has taken over Beth Apollo's role for EEL.  She reports to Fernley Dyson, as did Beth.  I was in the London office last week.  As a result of some of my discussions, Mike Jordan asked that James Scribner make a visit to cover the operations pricing model and to discuss some issues around global counterparty database.  Mike has suggested that James come to London during the first week in February, which sounds as if it will coincide with your trip.  Please coordinate with James so that your agendas are in sync (in case of potential overlap) so that we don't convey a right hand/left hand lack of coordination.  Since your agenda mentions GCP, there may some meetings that you are planning that would be appropriate for James to join.  By copy of this memo, I am asking James to do the same with you.  Thanks. 
 FYI on VNG... 
 Thanks for your help.  I will be in touch tomorrow on details.  Hopefully Lexi will have resumes for you.  If not, let me know, and some of us who interviewed on campus may have them still.  --sally 
 Thanks for your note and welcome back to Enron.  I am so pleased that you have returned.  I, too, look forward to working with you.  --Sally 
 And you and your bride haven't set Dallas as a honeymoon destination???? = =20 Your excuse seems to be a good one.  We will miss your presence and=20 participation, however.  Enjoy the wedding!!--Sally=20 
 Please mark your calendars for this reoccurring luncheon that Sally will be hosting:  Date: Every Monday (at least thru March), beginning Jan 29 Time: 11:30 - 1:00 PM Location: EB 30C2 Subject: Operational Risk for Enron Americas  Lunch will be served. 
 FYI.  Forgot to cc: you on this.  PT 
 On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i= n=20 downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and= =20 back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete= a=20 plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20 integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at= =20 their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20  I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig= n=20 session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t= h=20 in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called = a=20 DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos= ed of=20 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you= =20 have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20 regard this session as different from any working session you have previous= ly=20 experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven= =20 to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20 methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.  A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were= =20 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th= e=20 DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as= =20 little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results= =20 depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the= =20 entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor= t=20 and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. = =20 This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s= o=20 that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20 necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during= =20 these two days.  Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,= =20 and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment= =20 has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning= =20 the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.  I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc= e=20 for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00= =20 p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone= =20 else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to= =20 take your place until you and I have discussed this.  I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo= u=20 in Dallas! 
 Please put attendees on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note.  Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.  My last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full agenda.  Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.  Do stop by when you are in the office next week.  I should be in town all week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for the congratulations.  David of course is pleased about the promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it! Thanks, too, for your comments on the OpRisk session.  It is always a risk to pull together an audience of 90 and deliver something worthwhile.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 If my full e:mail address is not used, Steve Beck gets my e:mails.  He has forwarded this one.  Does it make sense to you?--Sally 
 Thanks for making this time change. 
 Peggy,  Is it the 4 Points or Eau Claire Sheraton?  I'm trying to book her a room for Tuesday evening.  Thanks, Patti x39106     Peggy Hedstrom 01/20/2001 09:23 AM 
 During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL. Since this is clearly on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost savings and our estimated timing on those savings.  I will ask James by copy of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.  I want to be able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings. 
 Audience for the report?  Is it you and Philippe, or will the report be distributed to all on your memo distribution list?  May make a difference in information provided.  We can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office operations in the report.  Would you also like some operating data - # of deals, bcf scheduled, etc.?  We can come up with a format and suggested content this week.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 This is some of the data that we need... 
 Can you get me info on the options with Dell?  I won't make it by to speak with them myself today.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your note. 
 Thanks, Sarah!  I was so focused on getting that in the mail that I obviously didn't proof the content very well.  Thanks for looking out for me!  --Sally 
 Janine,  When  is Beth's last day in London?  I need that date before I can proceed. I think it might be today, but I need to confirm that before I have everything switched over.  Patti 
 Janine,  I can handle that.   I will put in request today.  Patti x39106 
 The name of the restaurant that I liked for lunch was Christophers.  It is at Victoria Station, or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at Victoria Station.  Quick walk from the office.  Apparently, there is another location at Covent Gardens.  Dinner last night was fun.  It is always great to see you either in Houston or London.  Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt.  I think that the taxi driver was afraid that we would get him killed!  I called home last night and told Amanda about our discussion on a day in Paris.  She is ready!!  Let us know when you will next be in Houston.  I should be here quarterly - probably head back in March or April.  --Sally 
 Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on my calendar tentatively.  I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.  I assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.  While I have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar, I do need to hold those dates.  I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19 would be better.  --Sally 
 Thanks.  This will definitely help me.  --Sally     Enron North America Corp. 
 Silly as it may seem, have Brian Heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we used last year for headcount addtions.  Let's complete those for these positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.  They need to understand the addtional cost associated with these requests.  They will forget later in the year if they aren't making much money.  Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?  --Sally 
 Haven't had the chance to look at the UT presentation yet.  That will make good airplane material tomorrow.  If I make any changes I will try to fax pages to you after David picks me up at the airport tomorrow.  If I don't make chanages, I will call you Friday afternoon after landing and let you know that.  My schedule has been really full here, but very productive.  Thanks for your comments.,  I must admit, I am really excited about the promotion.  We can talk next week about what I hope to accomplish during this next year and where my major focus will be.  It will be helpful for you to know and understand that as we work together to make that happen.  I am certainly glad that you are here - my flight to London reminded me of your arrival about this time last year as I was heading to London.  Luckily a different reason for the trip this year, but still hectic.  I expect it to be a busy year.  You will notice that I have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews written and delivered.  Target is to be finished  by the end of January .  I will talk with you on Friday afternoon and see you on Monday.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note.  I will copy Patti on this reply and ask her to set us up for lunch when I am back from London.  --Sally 
 Technology is wonderful - I can log on here in the London office just as I do in Houston.  I feel very in touch.  Sounds like you have been busy - I think that the variety of items for the Sunday meeting sounds good.   Thanks for taking care of all of this.  London is cold but sunny - so very nice.  I do love coming here - hope to make the trip once a quarter this year.  I will be back at home by Friday evening, so let me know if there is anything that I can do before the meeting.  Otherwise I will see you on Sunday.  Too bad that Nancy doesn't want the input from  the girls on presentation.  I think that taking likes and dislikes would be good - no commitment to make changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful to have their input.  They are the honorees.  Oh, well .....as you say, this is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole thing.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  It is always interesting to scan the list and do a count of other females names.  Were not too many on this latest list.  We will have to work on changing that.  --Sally 
 The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.  Weather here is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back home).  We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus...  Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.  --Sally 
 This will work well, assuming Steve and Chris are available.  Hopefully, Lexi will have their resumes for you tomorrow.   Thanks for your help.  I will be in touch on details. 
 I assume that this request relates to corporate functions under Rick.  As of this moment, my team and I have not yet been granted access to merit information in the comp system.  I am in London this week, but have been in touch with my HR rep each day.  Latest word is that he aniticipates that we will be able to access merit worksheets sometime today.  Our deadline to submit merit increases is Monday, January 22.  SInce it is already after lunch on Wednesday here in London and we do not yet have access to the system, it is likely that my direct reports will work on merits over the next two days.  Since I will be in the air on Friday, it will be Monday before I have the opportunity to review all inputs from my direct reports and finalize merits.  --Sally 
 I am in the London office this week, so I won't be able to attend. 
 Congratulations on the baby - August seems like  a long time away, but given how quickly time passes at Enron, you will be there before you know it.  I would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at Enron sometime. I am in the London office this week, but will be back in the office the week of the 22nd.  Give Patti a call if you would like to get together and visit about options.  --Sally 
 Hopefully, those guys would stand out in the Woodlands like a sore thumb and would choose to go elsewhere.  Would be nice to have them behind bars, however. Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad idea, does it?  I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.  Any new news on those 7?  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/16/2001 12:53 PM 
 For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.  I sent Wes a message and copied you on that.  I can't remember the name of the person who works for Wes that handles moves.   Lisa filled in for her while she was out on medical leave.  She is back.  Can you get with her right away and see what you can come up with?  Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.  Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that Lisa is gone.  Can you check with her, too?  Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our (Energy Ops) move off of 30.  I don't know who is left on 30.  Can you get the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 so that I can get back with Jeff this week?  Thanks. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Any room at the inn?  I am looking for a spot for Beth Apollo.  She will be working with me, starting on January 29th in Houston.  --Sally  I am in London this week, but if you have any ideas Patti can follow through while I am out. 
 Thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home.  I appreciate your nice thoughts.  I am in London all week - is there anything that you or Jo need that I could bring back for you?  Just let me know.  I will be back in the office next Monday, the 22nd.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/13/2001 11:38 AM 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that everyone in the group sees this as a recognition of the value of the role that we play within Enron.  That will help us in attracting and retaining talented people, which makes my job easier and more fun.  --Sally 
 I have reviewed my section of Causey's presentation ( to be given by Brenda) and all looks fine except for page with world map.  Can we add Portland to the map?  That is the true trading location that is missing.  If it is tough to do, don't worry about it.  Thanks.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I have fun being here, which makes all of this even better!  --Sally 
 I am so sorry about the fire.  That must be awful -- but I am so glad that no one was hurt.  I had not heard about it until Mo called me today.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do.  Do you need me to get you anything over here and ship it to London?  I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next week.  I know that you must have hundreds of details to handle.  My plan right now is to be off the week of Thanksgiving.   My nanny will be on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town.  I may do some work early in the week, but likely from home.  The week after Thanksgiving I am supposed go to Wellesley College (Boston area) to interview for the analyst program.  I am due at a reception on Monday night (November 27) and I will interview on Tuesday (November 28).  Assuming that I can get a flight back on Tuesday night, I will be in the office here in Houston Wednesday through Friday that week.  Would that work?  Sorry I am out so much in the next few weeks.  Just let me know.  --Sally 
 Please check on those marked below    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for doing this.  I plan to come to London once a quarter.  I will have to choose my dates well in advance since these flights seem to be so full! --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks - a nice start to the year.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I certainly follow your career with interest.  I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the wedding picture with your Christmas card.  What a great picture - you look beautiful and happy.  Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.  My best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.  Maybe next year...  I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.  I will see Mo tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.  See you next week!  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note on the promotion.  This was definitely a goal and is very rewarding to get there.  I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.  In fact, I mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.  He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).  I filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.  I am in the London office this week.  Call Patti and ask her to schedule  a time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk about rotations.   I will look forward to it.  Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and dinner (someplace downtown with heat -- any suggestions?).  Patti is working on some of the details this week for us to host Ted Jacobs and about 14 of his students while they are in town for NAPE.  --Sally 
 Let's try the last row window seat.  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note on the promotion.  Patti is beginning to work on details for the 1/31 tour of Enron Field and dinner for Ted and his students from OU.  She should contact you for a list of recent OU grads so that we can get the invitation list together.  I hope that you have that date on your calendar!   I will ask MIke McConnell if he would like to join us, too. 
 Michelle:  This is a stab at something to include in the newsletter.  Will you or someone on your team rewrite as necessary?  I am in the London office this week, so e:mail is probably the best way to get in touch with me. Thanks.  --Sally Beck   Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across all commodities in 2001. 
 Thanks for you nice note.  I miss seeing you on 33.  Hope that all is going well for you.  --Sally     Susan Skarness 01/16/2001 09:07 AM 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I do hope that everyone on my team sees the promotion as recognition of the value of the roles that we perform.  All that should make it easier to attract and retain talented people that make my job easier and more fun!  I will ask Patti to schedule some time for us to get together when I am back in the office next Monday.  Have a good week.  ---Sally 
 It's late and I am out of paper.  Please print message and attachment for me for Tuesday morning.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that within my team that they see the promotion as an indication that the work that we do is recognized as meaningful.  All of that helps me in recruiting and retaining talented people that make my job easier and more fun! 
 Thanks for your nice note.  Haven't seen you in a while - hope that all is going well for you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your note.  I hope that things are going well for you at EBS.  I know that it must be busy.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.  What a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of EnronOnline.  --Sally 
 Had trouble finding your e:mail address the first time around for this memo. 
 I can access the global compensation system from London.  Today I have been able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday for bonus and LTI.  I assume that I will be able to access the screens for merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.  I will want to give my direct reports access to the system so that they can input their recommendations.  I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions and expectations.  Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have to request additional dollars for these worksheets.  Better not to ask for exceptions on everything!!!  What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted? Let me know.  If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where you can reach me.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that you are having fun in your new role. We will have to schedule lunch so that I can catch up on what you are doing now.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your nice note.  I am pleased for all of us at the increased recognition of the roles that we play within the organizaiton.  My ability to do my job well is very dependent on those of you who play key roles in operations.  Thanks for your part in that and for your continued support. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your note.  Yes, this definitely starts the year off nicely.  Hope your holidays were wonderful and that 2001 is a good year for you and your family, too.  --Sally 
 Enjoy the trip.  Two of our most fun vacations were at South Seas Planatation on Captiva Island.  Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them.  Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think that he dodged a bullet on this one.  We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!! 
 Patti:  Please forward this message to Tom Hopwood. =20  Tom:  The good (or bad) news was that I was here late enough to see the mem= o=20 come out on e:mail Friday night.

 The promotional memo came out a few hours too late today for me to be able to mention it when we talked this afternoon.  Congratulations on your promotion to managing director!  --Sally 
 The promotional memo came out a couple of hours too late for me to be able to mention it to you on the phone this afternoon.  Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  I have the dubious honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of the promotional memo via e:mail.  I will be in the London office next week and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.  I look forward to the chance to visit with you then.  --Sally 
 Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London office during the week of January 15.  I will arrive just after lunch on Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.  Much of my time will be spent with Fernley and Mike Jordan.  If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.  I will stop by while I am in the office.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.  Well deserved, and a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of the Calgary office. --Sally 
 Congratulations on your promotion to Vice President!  Well deserved and a nice way to cap off your stay in London.  I look forward to celebrating with you in London next week.  --Sally 
 I will be working in the London office Monday through Thursday, January 15 - 18 and will be be flying back to Houston on Friday, January 19.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has a contact numbers for me in London. I will be checking voice mail and e:mail regularly while I am there.  Key contacts in Houston next week will be:  DPR and MPR   Shona Wilson   x39123  Gas Operations   Jeff Gossett    x37306 (in Chicago office Jan. 16 & 17) Bob Hall    x36956  Power Operations  Stacey White   x31870 Leslie Reeves   x37962 
 Cathy:  I will be working in the London office during the week of January 15, so I will not be at the staff meeting on January 16.  --Sally 
 I don't think that the doorstep reviews are the right venue for this.  I believe that to address what seems to be David's concerns would be better handled with an appropriate person deemed to lead a special project in a directed timeframe with a well defined scope.  We purposefully utilize differing personal on the doorstep reviews and it would seem that concerns over proper valuation should be addresses in a timeframe that is not dependent on the schedule of doorstep reviews around the world. 
 Mark Frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming organizational memo and has asked that I forward it to you to be included. This would be included in the section under Commercial Support, added as an additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses Business Analysis and Reporting (I believe that these bullet points are on Page 3 of the draft memo).  Please call me at x35926 if you have any questions. 
 Please print attachment and make sure that e:mail addresses are included for the students.  Call Ted if any problems.  Thanks. We will need this to send invitations to students and Ted (plus some Enron folks) to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on January 31.  Let's talk about arranging details.  thanks. 
 Leslie:  Can you attend this meeting for me?  I will be in London.  Patti:  Can you get time and location for Leslie and let them know that she will be there instead of me?  Thanks. 
 Yes, just call Wanda and let her know that Rick has asked that we add EES Houston to the Doorstep review schedule.  In keeping with other reviews, I would not necessarily give Wanda the dates.  We should also send a short memo to Kevin and Marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the reviews.  I should probably send that to them.  Can you remind me when I am back in town the week of January 22?  Thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before, Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly welcome a conversation with you.  I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January 22.  -Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 It will be good to use your knowledge of the business in helping EIM to grow.  I hope that you enjoy your new rotation.  --Sally 
 I will be in London the week of January 15th.  I understand from Beth that you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.  Beth and I plan to have dinner that night.  Will you be back in town later in the week?  I have business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.  Could you make dinner on Wednesday night (the 17th)?  There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.  I have a belated Christmas gift for you.  Hope we can get together!  --Sally  PS  Am staying at 47 Park. 
 Please put details of this meeting on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend. Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?  This will be a meeting that we should have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and make timely decisions on how to handle those.  I am sure that there is some prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.  I would assume that we should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk books, OA, etc.  Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.  I would love for us take charge and lead this meeting.  --Sally 
 There isn't much to the memo, but this is it!  It came out well after the e= nd=20 of the work day for most folks.  I believe that Patti has sent you my trave= l=20 plans for next week.  Have a great weekend!=20 
 Thanks for the note.  I certainly know by responses that I am getting tonight who is in the office late!  I was told that the memo would come out today - you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!  I am really pleased about how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and its importance to the organization.  And yes, we need more female names on these lists!  --Sally   Tana Cashion @ ENRON   01/12/2001 07:43 PM
