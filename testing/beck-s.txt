 This reporting tool looks very useful.  I am glad to know that you are managing with this on a regular basis.  Do we have a well-defined follow-up process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?  This is a great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.  It would be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this. Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are doing confirmations?  I would include Global Products as well.  --Sally 
 I think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions. Our meeting will take place on December 8th, so we can be ready to discuss promotion recommendations as early as Monday, December 11.  When would be a good time for you?  The invitation to attend our December 8th meeting still stands.  I know that it is along way to come for a single meeting (although it will most likely be a fully day), but if there are other things that you could accomplish while here, it could be worth it.  --Sally 
 I will be out of the office after noon on Friday, June 9, headed to the hill country to pick up one of my daughters from camp.  I will not attend the Friday afternoon meeting.  You will be able to reach me on my cell phone, 713-417-1591, as needed during the afternoon. 
 Approved.  Please process.  Thanks, Sally Beck 
 Hi, Mike.  It is almost 2 pm Houston time as I am reading your message, so my hope is that you have already headed home today.  I would love to visit with you.  Would it work for us to talk at 9 am (3 pm London time) on Friday? Another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office.  I would expect to be in my car from about 7:00 to 8:00 am (Houston time) tomorrow.  My car phone number is 713-417-1591.  A few weeks ago I put together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to Houston.  Once you have scheduled a trip, my offer still stands to set up these meetings for you.  It may be easier for my assistant to coordate these things in Houston than for you assistant to attempt that from London, given the time difference.  I will look forward to speaking with you.  I understand that your value in the office is already felt.  --Sally 
 Buried with Shankman today.  I will e:mail you tomorrow. 
 Thanks for the info on your trip.  Have a great time -- I will be anxious to hear about the presentation in Natchez.  Love, Sally 
 I meant to send this to you.  --Sally 
 Thanks for confirming Mark's participation.  Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, will be sending information to your attention on the following:  Specifics on location of meeting at Rice Hotel Attendee list (names, titles, operating companies) Brief background on Mary Solmonson's Global Database Management Group Suggested  talking points for Mark's talk Agenda for the meeting  We will be sure to get this informaiton to you by Friday of this week, so that you can provide Mark with a copy when he is in the London office on Monday.  Thanks for your help--Sally 
 We will look forward to seeing you on the 17th.  Glad we could work out a date. 
 I left a voice mail message for Dave Delainey this morning asking for clarification around the LNG business.  As soon as I hear back from him I will let you know, and then based on that info we can decide on best next steps. 
 I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in Energy Operations.  Analysts  Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams  Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add more  strength to this group  Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to a trading  role, if appropriate   Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work experience and fit)  Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a direct hire  Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience   Associates  Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group  Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from Energy Operations interviewed him or her)  Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations   Let me know about next steps in this process.  I would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth. 
 I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they also have data in to Sally by Thursday.  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis.  Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as well. 
 Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business. (This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with Jeff on this? 
 We willl consider that a rain check.  Just let know in a cooler month when you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to play.  Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in Calgary the last time.  If you have a few minutes amidst the SAP training while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from your perspective how your interactions with my Houston operations group are going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement.  Just give me a call at x35926.  --Sally 
 We have lunch scheduled for June 22, according to my calendar.  I am looking forward to it.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.  I had put her on the list of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has been as involved with EOL.  --Sally 
 I didn't know about this one.  I'm going to follow up with Brent on this one and I will get back to you in a day or so.  We'll save the Scott Mills discussion for a later date!  On another note, I enjoyed lunch today.  Let me know when you want to get out of the building again sometime.  --Sally 
 My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project, Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity. 
 Please pring attached presentation for me in color.  Thanks. 
 I did walk out of the room with the two booklets (employee profiles and pre-review rankings) that had been distributed, and I left a message with Sheila Knudsen as soon as I got back to my office on Wednesday night to let her know.  They were delivered to Sheila on Thursday morning.  Can you verify that Sheila received those from me?  Thanks.  --Sally 
 That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.  I apologize if I seemed impatient in the meeting.  I know that you are working for the best interests of Energy Operations and  Enron.  By the end of the day I was probably looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend itself well to that.  Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to talk separate from immediate issues at hand?  I will have Patti get a date on the calendar.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.  Kristin certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half of the year.  I would like to see her develop a broader view across the organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.  I guess that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 06:21 PM 
 I have entered the following names into the Performance Review System as suggested reviewers:  Commercial Customers  Jeff Shankman Jim Fallon Gary Hickerson   Direct Reports  Brent Price (Business Controller -Natural Gas) Kristin Albrecht (Business Controller - Power) Todd Hall (Business Controller - Merchant Portfolio)   Others  Rick Causey Ted Murphy Fernley Dyson (London) 
 Happy anniversary!  I hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call you to wish you that over the phone on my way home.  Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a total for gifts for both girls.  Love, Sally 
 Scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is in the London office now is Brent Price.  I looked up Scott's name on our Enron People Finder, and it would appear that he is in the IT department.  I assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the UK, so I would suggest that you contact Beth Perlman in Houston who leads IT for ENA or talk with Mark Pickering in IT in London.  My role in Houston is over the trading operations groups, but does not include IT.  I wish that I could answer your specific question for you, but I think that referring you to IT will get you the answer that you need. 
 Ditto. 
 I assume that granting access for someone for whom Lorraine Becker is the supervisor should be approved by you.  I get hundreds of these, many for employees outside Energy Operations.  Thanks. --Sally 
 Please print for me on legal size paper.  Thanks. 
 Per my voice mail...somehow my intent to copy you on this didn't work. Shona's extension is 39123 and she is sitting on the 30th floor.  --Sally 
 I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be good for to consider hiring.  Here is her response.  Tony Vasut had called her and asked for this list as well.  Do you have him keyed in on our blitz effort for hiring of risk personnel?  Or is he working on some other initiative?  I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.  --Sally 
 FYI - I believe that Shona will prove to be a great asset to Enron.  We are following up on her leads for talent.  --Sally 
 I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time. Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally 
 Congratulations on the new role.  I think that it will be an interesting challenge and that you will do a great job.  How soon do you start?  --Sally 
 I have signed up for June 1st.  There is no indication on the e:mail that you forwarded of the location for the focus group.  I assume that more details will follow. 
 I have this on my calendar for September 7 and I am looking forward to it. Thanks. 
 Hi Ted,  It's Patti.  An all day meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 31 - the day you and Sally were scheduled for lunch.  Any possibility of rescheduling to another day?  Sally is available Thursday, June 1.  Just let me know.  Thanks, Patti 
 My new employee who will be working with me on global standards for operations for all trading/origination locations started with Enron yesterday.  Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.  She was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30 to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is one.   I will have her contact you later today.  Although she is new to Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the US and in Europe.  She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.   --Sally 
 I will be out of the office for one vacation day on Monday, May 22.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, has home and cell phone numbers where I can be reached throughout the day, if needed.  Primary operations contacts while I am out are as follows:  DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960  Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962  Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, May 23. 
 According to records from the Analysts Program, the following interns will be working within Energy Operations during the summer.  The assignment stated below is as reflected in the program's spreadsheet.  Name   School   Start Date Assignment  Luna Carlson  University of Florida  July 5  ENA - Risk Reporting and Analysis  Joshua Koenig  University of Florida  May 22  Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management  Jolly Jose  University of Houston  June 5   Energy Operations - Gas Operations Management  Michael Taylor  LSU    May 22  Central Desk Logistics  Daniel Graham  Morehouse   May 15  ENA - Financial Settlements  Angelique Woods University of Texas  May 22  ENA - Risk Management    First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made for desk, phone and computers for all.  Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to Enron.  Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you. 
 FYI  -- Let me know who Angelic will report to and what she will be doing. Thanks. 
 Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally 
 I agree that discussing the numbers in person with AA would be the right way to handle this.  And, I am looking to Brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting.  My expectation is that the vast majority of the $49MM variance will be explained and finalized by Monday at 11:00 am.  This finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.  I will be on vacation on Monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but I have carved out time during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation, as it is very important to me.  --Sally 
 I will be attending Wes Colwell's PRC meeting on December 7th.  It starts at 8:00 and may not take the entire day.  I will talk with Wes and see what he anticipates for timing to let you know if it makes sense to schedule me to interview.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Mary,  Sally says this is okay.  Patti 
 Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday.  I am glad that you are eager to get together to kick off your role -- we will have to save that for Tuesday, however.  I am taking the day off on Monday to be with my parents who will be in from Austin for one of my daughter's piano recital.  9:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday would be a great time for us to get together.  There are two other meetings that day that I would like to have you attend with me.  One is a weekly Risk Forum luncheon from 11:30 to 1:00 and the other is a meeting at 3:00 on trading operations for Tokyo.  I will give the details on location and list of attendees when you and I meet on Tuesday morning.  Enjoy your next few days.  I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday. Check with my assistant, Patti Thompson, on where you will be sitting.   I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  --Sally 
 Tara,  Sally says Todd's London project is under Barry Pearce (related to Continental Power) - Barry would need to designate London RC (or James New in his absence, since Barry is in Houston).  Regarding the "extra" housing costs, this would need to be charged to Todd's RC in Houston, which is #2182.  Please let me know if you require additional information.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Approved.  Please process. Sally Beck 
 Thanks for the update and attachment.  It will be great to have you back here in Houston.  I have heard lots of good things about your assignment there, however, so I know that the London group will miss your presence.  I will try to call you Wednesday morning on my way into the office.  I. 
 Sally has changed the time of her Thursday morning meeting to 8:30 - 10:30 AM (previously scheduled 8:00 - 10:00 AM).  Please let me know if you can't make this new time.  Topic for meeting:  information from her ENA Executive Offsite and also a brainstorming session.  Thanks, Patti x39106 
 Thanks for the reminders.  Hopefully, this will take care of this. 
 Sorry this took so long...  Sally says put her on our Co #413, RC # 0813 for now.  Also, she would like Angelique's resume as soon as possible.  Sally is in Calgary but she asked me to fax it to her as soon as I get it, so tomorrow would be great.  Thanks for your help, Patti x39106 
 Irena,  Can you attach file?  Patti    Enron North America Corp. 
 Mary,  As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison as a signer.  Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume Management groups.  This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.  Thanks, Sally 
 Ted,  I checked with Sally and she says Wednesday, May 31 is good for lunch & she looks forward to seeing you.  Patti 
 Fernley,  Sally asked me to forward this to you to outline what she is doing with Arthur Anderson to get ready for SAP, specifically, Global Products.  Patti 
 Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management operations initiatives.  I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary to get your input on his role to date. 
 Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA.  I didn't realize that when I said hello in the elevator last week that we would be seeing more of you in Houston.  I look forward to working with you when you arrive. 
 Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer.    Your leadership in ENA was appreciated and I will miss your active participation in ENA's business.  However, I hope that we will have opportunities to work together in the future.  --Sally 
 This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource.   Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.  Let me know how I can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined.  I was impressed with my brief glimpse of Jeff at yesterday's 5:30 meeting.  --Sally 
 Well done!  Beth will be a great resource.  --Sally 
 I will be in the Calgary office from Wednesday afternoon, May 10 through noon on Friday, May 12.  I can most easily be reached through Peggy Hedstrom, whose phone via tie line is 820-6753.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, has a copy of my itinerary and phone and fax numbers at my hotel, if needed.  Primary operations contacts in Houston while I am in Calgary are as follows:  DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242  MPR   David Maxwell   x36983  Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960  Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962  Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210 
 Laura,  I am attaching resume of Mark Mixon that Sally left you a voicemail regarding on Monday.  If you are going to be in town and would like to see Mark, please let me know and I would be happy to make arrangements.  Thanks, Patti Thompson x39106 Sally's Assistant 
 I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear Julie Andrews speak.   Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as our daughters.  So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High School with Meagan.  Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.  I hope that all of you enjoy the evening.  The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next Tuesday, May 16.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot for dinner.   That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.  I can't think of a better idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, motivated women!     I will look forward to introducing her to those of you whom she has not yet met. 
 I have been summoned for jury duty onTuesday, November 28 at 8:00 am.  While wanting to fulfill my civic duty, I am also hoping to be an unlikely juror this time around so that I can be back in the office sometime on Tuesday.  I will call in and let Patti know my status. 
 I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this afternoon.   I have left a message for Bryce and I will get with him on Tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message after that.  --Sally 
 Below is the name and phone number of the woman that I worked with to arrange our tour of Enron  Field.  She may not be the person to talk with regarding displaying a boat, but  will very likely be able to give the correct contact.  It was nice to meet you.  I have enjoyed getting to know Bethany through NCL.  Good luck!    Jill McCormick  713-259-8965 
 I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's name was "in play", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead. Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would like.  His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".  He and Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.  Let's discuss.  --Sally 
 Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates. 
 Please print the attachment for me in color.  Maybe three copies.  Thanks. 
 Stephen joined Enron on January 29, 1996.  Is there any other info that you need?  Are you still planning to be in Houston next week? --Sally 
 He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.  He reports to Scott Mills, who is the user lead for the project.  I am copying Scott on this message, as his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the horizon and how critical Tom's involvement is to those deliverables.  I suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions.  --Sally 
 You have the right earrings -- they are tiny!  But that's what she would like.  She will be really pleased.  She loves her silver ones, but they are not great for everyday wear -- gold is better for her ears.  Sounds as if your weekend was fun.  Ours was nice --errands and stuff on Saturday and the Enron picnic at Astroworld on Sunday.  Otherwise, just camping out in the mess at our house.  I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist. Sounds as if from her ER buddy at the Heart Hospital that she has decided that they need both -- one for counseling and one for meds.  I believe that she and Dad will each see a counselor type on Tuesday this week.  I hope that they will begin to find some relief.  Sounds as if they are really having a hard time - at least Mom.  We would still like for you to come visit.  Let's talk dates when you're ready.  --Sally 
 FYI - Let's talk.  I am already booked for Tuesday AM - could you attend and would you want to?  Let's talk before getting back to Margaret.  --Sally 
 FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally 
 Thanks for the heads up.  I get so many of these requests and never can tell what is being requested!  Your note made this one fast and easy to handle. Thanks. 
 I understand that Ashley Worthing has been hired by Enron to start work this summer.  I think that she is graduating from Texas A&M.  She is my cousin's daughter, so I am just curious whether or not she is coming in as an analyst.  Please let me know if that is the case.  Thanks. 
 I gave a copy of this document to Wes Colwell immediately following last week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you.  He is the most appropriate respondent from ENA.  --Sally 
 Did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail ?  There was not one attached. 
 Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town. Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally 
 Glad you sent a note - as crazy as life is at our house right now, I did not get the message from Tammy.  Lots of catch up in the office last week, which will continue this week.  I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.  We are starting to talk birthday with Meagan now.  I will get back with you in a couple of days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.  Thanks for asking. --Sally 
 Hi Clare,  How about:  Tuesday, May 9th 1:30-2:30 PM or 3:00-4:00 PM  Sally has tentative plans to go to Calgary May 10-12, so Tuesday is best for her.  If neither of these time slots work, just let me know and I can move things around to accommodate James.  See ya, Patti 
 Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition:  Example:  Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that is clarified. 
 Barbara,  Will this be at 4:00 PM on Monday?  Sally has meeting w/ Louise Kitchen from 3:30 to 4:30, so she will probably be 30 mins late to Jeff's meeting.  Patti 
 It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure time.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.  I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.  My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like a very long ten day stay.  He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight! Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health for him going forward.  Thanks for asking.  --Sally 
 She was Superior - top of the table.  Her written review should be in the file.  Let me know if HR can not produce that for you and I can get you a copy.  --Sally     Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 12:46 PM 
 Tara,  When I tried to approve this request (Sheri gave verbal approval), I got message that it had already been approved by another access approver.  Patti x39106 
 Thanks for your note.  Between meetings today, I will construct a loose job description and e:mail that to you later today.  I realized after you left that we did not talk about compensation.  It would help me in creating this role with our HR group if I knew ballpark figures on compensation.  We have a good comp team that can research that for me, but a short cut would be to know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking for  in making a move.  Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail.  My number is 713-853-5926.  --Sally 
 I would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first Gas Ops program. Keep me posted on date and time.  Thanks for attending the meeting yesterday.  I hope that you will let me know when and how I can best be involved and provide support for your efforts.  --Sally 
 You have a ticket - we will see you there, with you pager on!  Patti will get your ticket to you before Thursday. 
 Do you want to give your tickets to someone in your group and join the management team?  Up to you...    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sounds interesting, and Scottsdale is supposed to be nice.  Enjoy! 
 Sounds like a good idea.  I am glad to Theresa is getting some benefit from the program.  --Sally 
 Sheila,  I'm sorry I haven't responded to this before, but Sally has been out of the office with family illness & I haven't been able to check with her.  I will be out of the office until Tuesday, so if you need this information before then, please call Chantelle Villanueva at ext.36279 on Monday and she can check with Sally then.  Thanks, Patti 
 Joe,  Sally is out of the office, but wanted me to forward the message that she had reviewed the draft that you put together regarding power trading and she doesn't have any comments.  Patti x-39106 
 Approved.  Sally Beck 
 Here it is! 
 I have this on my calendar.  I have jury duty on Tuesday starting at 8:00 am.  I hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as I can.    So I should be able to make the meeting at 4:00.  I will call you if I get hung up at the court house.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.  I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following:  Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU  Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida  Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of Florida  Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU  Carolyn Barrett  EBS  Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P   Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus.  SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May.  Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or communication about the program.   We hear rumors of "tracks", but no facts or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some had not.  Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.  Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.   Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:  Disc 
 Kim,  Sally says that Wes Colwell will be assigning ENA representative.  Patti x39106 
 I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.  Below are my suggested seven appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.  I made the selections based on their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.  I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today.   Analyst  School  Current Rotation Rationale  Ilan Caplan  UT   CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations  Erin Rice  Trinity   CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the solution; female minority  Brian Hoskins  Vanderbilt  ENA Trading  I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one  Carrie Southard  Texas A&M  ENA - EOL  Current MSA rotation  Alejandro Veiga Rice   ESA - Venezula  Good ideas; diverse background  Courtney Votaw  Pepperdine  Corp. - PR  Adds interest to the mix with her rotation & background  Adrian Woolcock Rice   EES   Sounds mature; good ideas 
 Approved. Sally Beck 
 I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.  However, in my staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for EOL access.  We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.  Susan needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager should  okay this as well.  --Sally 
 Please incorporate these changes into the 2000 plan.  Thanks. 
 We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all be glad to see you.  I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it. And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  Love, Sally 
 I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office. Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, however!  I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can easily step out to talk with you. 
 Please incorporate the management contact changes per Sheila Glover for the 2000 plan. 
 Can you coordinate the Scott Tholen's team to do this ASAP?  Thanks.  Keep me updated on when Fernley will have access.  Thanks. 
 Approved. Sally Beck  System would not allow me to submit request electronically. 
 Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get together.  Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.  When that is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.  Hope your weekend was a good one.  Have you seen Brent yet?  --Sally 
 Willie Harrell Security Request approved. Sally Beck 
 Fall sounds good to me.  In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 The scholarships, while sponsored by Enron, are technically awarded by UT.  I will be talking with Sue White today, and I will get her take on whether or not the university wants to contact the winners or whether Enron should do it.  I will let you know.  The 24th is a great day for me for the dinner in Austin.  So if that works for recepients and faculty, then that would work our well.  Keep me posted. --Sally    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have asked Patti to get us together  to discuss your e:mail message as soon as possible.  Hopefully, we can work that out this week.  I llok forward to talking with you and I will be glad to help you in any way that I can. 
 Energy Operations will enjoy participating in this program.  I would like to bring this us up at my staff meeting on Monday, April 10, so I will get back to you with the number of students and the contact person(s) next week. --Sally     Susan Skarness 03/31/2000 04:37 PM 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.  The field will make baseball much more fun in Houston. 
 I already have this date on my calendar.  Count me in.  --Sally 
 We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue. However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official notification from the University takes place.  Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she would like to be included if her schedule permits.  Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me know how I can help with these arrangements.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for sending the announcement to me.  You will be a great asset to EBS.  And you will probably be working with some of our old Energy Operations staff members!  Stay in touch and I wish you the best in your new role. --Sally 
 I will look forward to meeting you during your visit to Houston next week.  I will work with Carol to schedule a time that will work for both of us.  Have a nice flight.  --Sally 
 Glad you enjoyed the game.   It was certainly a panoramic view from up there!  I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to Enron, and I am  certainly glad that you are here.

 Glad you enjoyed the game.  That was quite a climb to those seats!  I did it a couple of times with my two year old in arms, and wasn't sure that I would make it!  That's good that you could watch from a lower level. --Sally 
 Per my voice mail message, attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in London.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Fernley and I plan to send this out sometime next week, prior to Brent's assignment starting on April 10. 
 Do you know what this is?   ISO makes me think power.  Any clues?  --Sally 
 Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this season.  One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is two tickets in the terrace level.  I have also purchased one parking spot in a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.  I have divided the tickets among you, with my husband's help.  He identified "good games" (i.e. teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across my direct reports.  Tickets for the other games have been distributed based your percentage of Energy Operations employees.  For most games, you will receive all six tickets.  You can use these tickets for yourself and for a small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.  The parking information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.  Patti is including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.  Your tickets will be distributed to you this week.  I hope that you and your staff will enjoy these.  I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.  I have chosen to distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy Operations who are not my direct reports.  SInce you will have first call on the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.  I wanted to make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.  Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a weekday afternoon and one a weekend.  I will let you know these dates soon, as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games. 
 Approved.  Please note that Co. # should be 0342 for Misc. Expense on Todd032400LondonSAP expense report. Thanks, Sally Beck

 Sorry, I can;t help you on this one.  I don't have a copy.  --Sally 
 Meant to copy you on this reply to Mike, but forgot to do so before my initial send.  Here it is... 
 I will be at the meeting on Thursday.  I have asked Brenda Herod to attend as well.  Can you add her to your distribution list so that she receives notice of these meetings as well?  That way, one or both of us will be able to attend.  Thanks. 
 I will plan to attend.  Can you attend as well?  --Sally 
 Definitely take off and meet Scott at the airport.  I know that you will be glad to see him.    Enron North America Corp.

 I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use this.  Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you. 
  Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies in which Enron holds an ownership interest.   Attached is a copy of that schedule.  Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.  You will note that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.  We have identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA. 
 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591). I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once or twice a day.  I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London around 1 AM Houston time).  I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27. 
 The e:mail system never recognizes Rick Causey, so you were dropped from the first distribution.  I have to remember to type your full first name! 
 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday this week (March 15-17).   I will be with my children while they are on Spring Break.  I can be reached those three day either at home (281-370-8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).   The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the office while I am out: Key Operations Contacts March 15-17  Brent Price   Business Controller, Gas  x37647  Kristin Albrecht   Business Controller, Power  x34763  Also, I will be in the London office during the week of March 20th.  I am working with Fernley Dyson and John Sherriff to structure training and orientation for a new head of trading operations that has been hired in London.  I am also working to provide transition resources to London for operational controls unttil the new guy is on board.  My work on this should be completed by the end of next week.  I will return to Houston on Friday, March 24.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106),  will have a copy of my schedule while I am in London as well as an international mobile phone number where I can be reached. Please don't hesitate to call.  I will be responding to voice mail messages throughout the week.   The following persons will serve as key operations contacts in the Houston office while I am working from London:  Key Operations Contacts  March 20-24  Brenda Herod   Business Controller, Gas  x35778  Kristin Albrecht   Business Controller, Power  x34763  Kristin Albrecht will attend the Monday, March 20th staff meeting at 9:30 in my absence. 
 I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.    -Sally 
 Per my earlier e:mail message, I am forwarding to you the draft of the report on the operations/controls review of Singapore.  (It is an attachment to the message from Scott Earnest to me.)  The most current drafts of the reports on Oslo and  Frankfurt were compiled by the AA team in London.  Nick Swingler is apparently out on vacation this week.  I have asked AA personnel from Houston to coordinate with their London office to get you a copy of those two draft reports.  Given the time difference, you should receive thos reports via e:mail from AA on Wednesday.  --Sally 
 I'll look forward to seeing you.  Since my first note, I have scheduled a dinner with Richard Sage on Thursday evening - the only time that he and I can meet, since he is in Helsinki through Wednesday, in the office on Thursday but booked that day.  With the Tuesday dinner with Fernley, that leaves Monday or Wednesday.  I hope that one of those days works for you and Frank.  I will try to call Mo - I think that she is still in Houston today. --Sally 
 1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive those drafts today.  2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am there.  3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are the following:  Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide for you during this transition period Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of the details on having support personnel in London  Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one (which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)  Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective trading operations and controls world-wide  I look forward to seeing you next week. 
 Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible.  Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week. It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London. I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed.  I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids. The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April.  Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them. 
 I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to Houston next week.  My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it looks as if we will miss one another.  My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  I will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, with effective exception reporting.  This is a key initiative for 2000 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities. 
 I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next week and I had asked her to arrange  a lunch with you and Brent, plus some time for just the two of us to get together.  We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally 
 Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.  Wanted to see if you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.  We arrive on Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning. Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.  But Monday, Wednesday and Thursday are available.  Does it work for you with the baby to do evenings?  Let me know. 
 Have fun in San Antonio.   It is a very popular spring break destination. Enjoy it! 
 3PM sounds great.  I will look forward to meeting you. 
 We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations.  I view this as a business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.  ENA is picking up the cost associated with the family.  Sounds as if I need to make sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that handled.  That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those days., both evening games.  I would be happy to give you four tickets for either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 10th or the 12th.  We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying through Thursday, so we should see one another before April.  I am working on an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there.  --Sally 
 Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these meetings if you would like to do so.  The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 
 Thanks for your homework on this.  We will definitely take a look at these two places next week while we are in London.  Let us know what we need to do to schedule this.  I look forward to meeting you.  One of your earlier messages suggested meeting on Monday morning.  Monday is great, but we would have to make that an afternoon meeting.  Brent and I will be on the flight that leaves Houston at 7:00 PM on Sunday evening, arriving at Gatwick around 10:00 AM.  By the time we clear customs, take the train, check in to the hotel and shower, we will not be in the office before 12:30 or 1:00.  Do you have a time available to meet with us that afternoon?   Thanks.  --Sally 
 Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might interest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate. If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral along to other HR groups.  FYI - James will start work here on April 3.
