  Lloyd, I received this from Preston.    It appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch. We were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that EES was to provide. We havent received the necessary information,  so no choice has been made yet.  Please see the attached and let me know your comments.  JMF 
 Scott, I heard that the TPC was in decent shape.    Are you planning on playing on Saturday in the morning or afternoon? How many people do you have in the group?  JForney 713-853-7160 
    Jerrry,  See the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.    We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the	OOM  (Out of Merit)  decrease for today.   It is our understanding,  per the protocols,  that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35  scheduled sale  whole.    We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of:  the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.    If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive: $35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.  For the capacity tomorrow, We will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.    The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.    The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed. At the time of deployment,  we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised. We bid in a  Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 ".   They can take partial hours, at their option.  I hope this helps.  JFORNEY Director, EPMI 
  Jerry, Please disregard the explanation of the OOM power settlement.     The ISO called us at 7:15 pm and explained a different scenario altogether.   We need to discuss this further. Sorry for the confusion.  JForney 
 Thanks for your reply. Here's what I have learned from our conversation: Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were "captured" by Don and Juan's group? I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots. I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.  Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.  I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?  JMF 
   Ben, Could you come by,  I have a question about rearranging our phone turrets.  Thanks, JMForney 
 Scott, The wife is out of town until Saturday night.    I can play alot of golf on Saturday,  but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday.     I will be available for the golf marathon on Saturday.    I have one player for Saturday morning,  but I dont have a player for Sat. afternoon yet, although I have another co-worker who is interested. Should I fill this spot as well?  JMF 
 youre an animal  jmf 
 cant even go to the head.  thanks for the offer anyway.  JMF 
  Ben, as discussed,  please move the four Ercot lines to the front page for the listed people below.       Also,  to the extent possible,   add the E lines.  These guys are prioritized as follows:  John Forney Eric Saibi Steve Olinde Joe Capasso (new to group) Alex McElreath Jeff Miller Smith Day Joe Errigo 
   Dahlke,  I purchased a gas deal,   10,000 mmbtud - HSC for 7/10-7/31 for $3.15.   I bought this through Doug G-S. Wont you take the final prints for each day and calc profitability for me,  or how do you do this?  Please give me some money  JMF 
 HOW WAS THE TRADITION COURSE?  ARE YOU GOLFED OUT YET?    I DIDNT DO ANYTHING SATURDAY NIGHT.  JMF 
 Rebecca, We have heard that the resource imbalance was pretty high.     We will discuss this with you.   We definitely dont want to talk to Teco/Frontera until we get a handle on this. We will come by this afternoon.  JMF 
 I left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question. Could you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail? If I cannot answer the question,  then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep.  The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed. This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.  Let me know what you have.  JMF 3-7160 
 TJ: Please make sure that the Ercot RC is not billed for our portion of the customer trip.   If I can assist with this accounting,  let me know.    I dont wish to subsidize the other Hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense.  In the future,   I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group. I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.  I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.   We werent able to secure a commitment from customers,  but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).    I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip did not change,  rather the allocation to each group was changed.  My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything. But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank,  profitability and that I have been here 8 years. I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.  JMF 
   Johnny, What is the status of George?   I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.   George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time. Lloyd is out of town until Monday,  so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.   Thanks, JForney 3/7160 
  Johnny, I just received this from Lloyd.   I dont want to cause any double coverage by HR, so you might want to check with Kim. Thanks! 
  Mark, I called earlier today and left a lengthy phone message........sorry about that - we had a trading issue in the middle of my conversation with you.  Anyway,  I received the following question from some of our Retail folks. If you could help answer this question I would really appreciate it. Jeff Miller and I are planning to visit Austin next Friday to discuss Settlements.   We look forward to meeting you. Are you a golfer?   We may try to play Friday afternoon.  JForney 
 Here you go:  There is no banking mechanism.    If A&B are net long,  they receive the balancing energy price for all of their mw's.   If C & D are short,   then their short position is covered by the Ercot ISO;    C & D are charged the balancing energy price plus replacement reserve /mw.  If the money, at the end of the day,   is insufficient to pay A&B,  then this full cost will be allocated on a load share ratio basis.     This charge will be allocated under the UFE (unaccounted for energy) charge type. If C & D serve load,  then they will share the expense of paying for the balancing energy price to A & B.      A & B escapes this expense allocation, as they do not serve load.   JForney 
   Kim, Keenon has been recommended to Doug as a possiblity in RT.   I think our roster has been filled out,  however,  I had promised this guy an interview before I knew that Lloyd had lifted some people. Can we schedule an interview with Keenon,  as I think that he is a strong prospect.  I will send you a copy of his resume via office mail.     He can be reached at 713-410-2255.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks, JForney 
 Doug, I am planning on attending this settlements deal;  we plan on meeting Mark Patterson there. JMF 
   Rebecca, pls see the attached for our expectation of imbalance for 8/2. 
   Ercot is now requiring that we fill out and fax the attached form to  them when we have imported/exported across one of the DC ties. The file is located in:  M:electric/24hour/ercot/dc schedlist.spreadsheet.   Please update tag number,  megawatts (positive for exports, negative for imports),   and total number of schedules. 
 Thanks Lance, I have a question:  on the Ercot transmission outage  page,   the TU  Bellmead station is listed as having trouble - the buss is damaged due to storm.    Is this the reason that there are TU CSC's, as mentioned on the Ercot conference call?  The station is to be out until August 10th.  We have had a significant price split and I think that this might be the specific reason. I have tried powerworld,  but I couldnt turn off this station.  What do you think?  JMF 
  Frontera is long hour ending 7-11 by 5 mw';s.    This has been scheduled into the North 2001 zone on behalf of Teco Services.    Please sell this power for > $5,  if possible. Use your judgement - let me know if you have questions.  Please cut the imbalance deal and replace with the new sale.  Thanks, JMF 
   Attention: The Ercot ISO has been settling our trades scheduled to the North by giving us the West or South Balancing Energy price.      We have officially disputed this allocation, as we believe that we would,  at most,  incur a load deviation imbalance in the North zone (to be settled in the North). Again,  a purchase in the South scheduled to our load in the North is receiving the South or West prices.  We are awaiting Ercot's explanation.  Until further notice,  do not schedule energy from the South or West to the North.         You may still engage in intrazonal, or same zone,   trades (QSE to QSE ).  What IS permitted is imported from outside Ercot into the North zone.     The DC tie is in the North and we should stay aggressive,  working with the SPP team to secure transmission to and from Ercot.    When in doubt,   wake me up.  Update:  At 6 pm,  our Rep from Ercot agreed that the schedule mentioned above should have load imbalance assessed at the NORTH price.     However,   I still cannot accept his answer as the gospel,  as any written interpretation of their tariff will always overrule our guy.   I will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water,  but for now:   EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!   JMF

   We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent.     Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera. We should have balancing bids in for all hours,  but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours. We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera.  Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen.    This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being "balanced down."  We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.     If this situation happens,  we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO. This is an important part of the Services side of our business,  and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.   If anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'   JMF 
  Lloyd, Do you want to answer George's questions, or do you want me to handle this?  JMF 
   Samuel, The traders listed above are not valid in Enpower as traders under the following books:  Ercot Hourly Teco Services   Please have them added asap,  or if you could,  let me know who is responsible for making this change.   Thanks Samuel,  JMF 
   Take a look at this,  add or format ( add to letterhead, etc)   as necessary. Let me know what you think.

 doing well in the book.   spread options coming in well,   real time going very well.    same old stuff. very much deja vu. golf is very good,  as I get to play more often.  how is it going for you? 
 I can meet with Keenon today or tomorrow. I will be out of the office Wed-Fri.  Thanks, JMF 
 1.00 PM IS FINE   JMF 
 Ercot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain: Sometimes when we are  submitting an hourly schedule, through the Ercot Portal,  the Day-ahead schedules are affected. Mismatches for every counterparty occur.     We are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly, even for one hour. Eric Saibi spoke with the Ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side.  I called Ercot  and after some time,  they relayed that they were experiencing server problems.  Attached below is the ticket number related to this problem.   If this occurs again,   make sure that you reference this number.  Thanks, JMF 
 Erik, I will be available earlier than 5:30 for an informal discussion.  I will be in the office Monday and Tuesday of this week.   I will be out the remainder of the week on vacation. Let me know if this works.  JForney 
   George, I have been out of the office on Ercot business since Thursday of last week.   Sorry for the delay. Lloyd and I would like for your start date to be on September 1st, if possible .    Actually,  two weeks notice would fall on September 3rd,  I believe.    Thanks, JMF 
 David, we often trade with EPMI, as they may be the best bid on any given day.      So,   the language should apply.  Thx, JMF 
 Today would be fine.  Between 12-1pm. I can sit with you for an informal meeting and see where it goes.   I am located at 3111e.  Thanks, JForney 
  That is fine.  JMF 
  thanks BOYYYYYYYYYYY 
 WAS THIS NOT CANCELLED? 
   Narsimha - Can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load?     I think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved. We will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do.   What more is there?  I have heard that this could start as early as September,  but we are still a bit short on detail.     If we started in September,  I would envision passing local charges, congestion,   etc to EES.    We would schedule your hedges,  your load and cover any remaining balance (or not) with respect to load zone. We would provide scheduling services,  settlements and   24 hour coverage to handle any  contingencies that might occur.  I look forward to working with you on this issue.  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Thanks, JForney 
 I played the last four days: barton creek in Austin ColoVista in Bastrop (near Austin) Fish Creek Fish Creek yesterday.  I am hitting the ball alot better and starting to make some putts.   I wont be around this weekend,   as I am vacationing down in South Padre Island for the next few days. We need to take that boat out so I can show you around Galveston.    Fishing is good and you can pull up to certain restaraunts on the water. Let me know when you wanna go.  JMF 
 We have not scheduled this load as of yet.   I met with Narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s. and get at least a rudimentary plan in place. Here it is: By 7am - EES submits to us their  load plan / hedges - EES to use their forecast initially. We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies Wholesale settlement provided,   ancillary service charges , local congestion,  etc is to be passed to EES.  Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start  at the latest.  We are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above.    We will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to A/S and other charges. We are prepared to go forward with this immediately.  JMF

   Kim, Havent talked to you for awhile.    Hope everything is going well. I do have a question about who will be doing my review.     Also,  dont we still have a rating system?     I would like to see my entire review and have the opportunity to sign off on it. Also,  is it possible for me to review my personel file?   Is this within company policy?  Lastly,   can you provide to me a copy of my contract?    Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.  Thank you for your time.  JMF 
 Perfect.   Thanks. I can review the folder anytime this week.  Thanks again JMF

   Lloyd, Frontera needs a portal so that they may submit outage schedules for their plant.        We, as the QSE,   arent able to submit this, per Protocols.  Thanks, JMF 
   Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was "unavailable and offline". The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.  Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400. I called Mark Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.  His reply is as follows:  Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available. Since we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon. We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday. If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.    We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs. The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.    This was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan "on the fly"  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.   Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented:  If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.  If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:  $50 premium for OOM up. $10 premium for OOM down.  These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order. If we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.  If we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.  Please call me if you have questions,  J. Forney Director,  Enron Ercot Region 713-853-7160 
   There is length for the offpeak scheduled in the North and South.   LET IT RIDE, no adjustment is necessary.  Ercot Asset is long 50 mw from 12-23 in the North.   We will monitor and sell hourly,  as needed.  Thanks, JMF 
 I want to go to this! 
   Victor, Thanks for calling today.   Obviously this hasnt been the best day in my 8 year career with Enron! I have attached my resume for your review.    I am interested in talking to you in more detail at your convenience.  Thanks again, JForney cell phone 713-412-7529 
   Jerry, Please see the attached spreadsheet for tomorrow. We booked you out on the Enron option for $22.25.    So,  we are selling you next day for $22.25. Also,  to fill Mirant's call for 12-22 we purchased $23 power from Aquila.    This should get you flat for the day.  We will not run tomorrow,  as of now.    We will reflect this in the Resource Plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline. 
  For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to "junk" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price. A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least. If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered. Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.  Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.  More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.  JMF

   Victor, We spoke  a couple of days ago concerning employment opportunities at LCRA.    Do you have any questions about the resume that I sent? I can supply additional info or answer questions,  as necessary. I was also wondering what specifically LCRA was looking for.     I have QSE experience and am familiar with Ercot billing. Addtionally,  I have some extremely capable co-workers that would be interested in talking with your firm.     Our Ercot team has been profitable and is extremely motivated.  Let me know if we have something in common.  Thanks, John Forney Director,  Ercot Trading 713-412-7529 281-419-4388

   I have entered an annuity from Doug's book to Paul's to account for imbalance losses due to the September 11th tragedy. Annuity number 774083,  dated 9/12 will transfer a total of $67,530.15.  See the attached spreadsheet.  JMF 
   What up badeer? 
 It doesnt take you long to respond to a slam.    of course, no details of our discussion were mentioned to badeer - i told bobby that you sounded like you came from a bar the last time i talked to you. i am flying out of state for an interview on monday.    i expect to fly again later next week. i am still interested in being a part of a leaner trade floor at Enron,  but this proposition is less likely than my leaving.    the creditors and the bankruptcy judge are not that likely to approve good bonuses for performers, in my opinion.      We will be dogged with credit issues and lawsuits for a long time. what do you think? 
 Greetings:  My name is John Forney and I am currently an employee of Enron North America.   I am a Woodlands resident and take great interest in employment opportunities withyour company.  I have been involved, primarily,  in electricity and gas trading.     I also have gas purchase and natural gas pipeline experience. I have a proven track record of success and look forward to new challenges.  I have attached my resume which details my  experience and capabilities.    If you have further interest in talking with me,  please contact me at 713-853-7160 or 281-419-4388.  Thanks for your time,  John Forney Director,  Ercot Trading 
 We understood,  at the time,   that the test was going well.     This is Frontera's test to continue to bid in replacement and non-spin. JMF 
 thank you 
  havent talked to you for awhile. hope everything is going as well as can be.. i have a biz question:   is the cash balance plan safe?  jmf 
  george,  here is some info... 
   Frank, Thanks for meeting with me yesterday.   I am impressed with your operation and the people who will be building this from the ground up. I'm sure we will be talking again soon.    I regret that I wasnt able to stay longer and possibly catch some specs.  Thanks again,  John Forney 
  Allan, I havent heard anything from Anadarko,  but I am talking to several other players.    There is a possibility that I will be relocating to Tampa Florida or possibly back to Oregon.	Thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation.      We still need to make time for that beer.   I get out of work very early each day, as our trading opportunities are severely limited.  I would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at Enron.      My friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in HR as a specialist.    They are a Woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to Houston.  I know that Anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes,  but I didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what Jim has to offer.  This guy is extremely detail oriented and capable. If you could review and pass these on,  I would really appreciate it:  this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working.  Just kidding  Tell me what is happening with you.  ( I still dont miss Koch,  but I miss working 8 - 9 hour days!).  I think that Mike Eiben has been long gone from Enron.   I had been looking for him before the layoffs,  but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory, etc.  Call or e-mail and I will meet at Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere else.  We dont have to talk about work.....no,   lets not talk about work!  Thanks,  JMF 
   I have a 1:10 t time for Windrose on Sat.    I have a 3:1 coupon that will reduce the expense to $51 pp + tax. Let me know if you can go.   JMF 
   Rob, attached are my friend's resumes.     i also added mine for your critique.   Let me know what you think. I need to talk to you about negotiating a new deal;   unfortunately it looks as if I may be leaving the state,  either to Florida or back to Oregon.  The offers are starting to come in,  but I dont want to leave anything on the table.   Need your advice,  so let's have that beer! 
  Frank, I spoke with Victoria Bender and Julie Gildea yesterday.   Julie expects to send me some info today. I will be out of the office after lunch today,  so it would be best if she sends e-mail to my home address,  fourknees@msn.com  My cell phone will also be on,  the number is 713-412-7529.   Thanks, JMF 
  Amy, do you have time to meet with me for 15 minutes?  thanks, jmf 
 yep 
 cant make it tonight.   this is my 13th anniversary with the wife.    i am going to humble for some dinner. we are going to florida on wednesday and will return on sunday. the company down there is flying us out to take a closer look at the area.  it looks as if i have sold the audi.     a guy put a deposit down on it today and i am supposed to meet him tomorrow. lets golf soon. jmf 
  Isac's last day  was November 6th.   He took a job with Vitol, in the oil trading area.  I dont recall who his HR rep was.  Hope this helps,  JMF 
 http://www.co.montgomery.tx.us/webwiz/wwiz.asp?wwizmstr=WEB.CRT.STATEMENT&V1=00.9715.23.04800 
 Yes, but we are consistenly being OOMC'd,  so it's kind of an ongoing question. Thanks, JMF 
 Cant - I have friends coming in from Calgary.       I went to a great course yesterday;   Glenloch Farms is not too far from the Woodlands and was a cool layout.   We will have to go when I get free.  JMF 
   We are short the following schedule to Stec:  he 13 -10 mw's he 14 - 20 he 15 - 30 he 16 thru 21 - 40 mw's he 22 - 30 mw's he 23 - 25mw's   If you fill this schedule,   reduce the purchase that is in the Portal and replace with the new source.   Thanks,  JMF 
   I need some support on this: For the last two weeks,  Ercot has been giving us OOMC orders.     They have told us to run the plant, without question.     We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.    To a man,   the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power. I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification)  to Mark Patterson,  starting weeks ago on this issue.    Yesterday,   I caught Mark by phone at 5:30pm.  Mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC'd and we should run,  but they are not going to pay us the hr calc. They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.     This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.       We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.      It costs us $26 to generate power.  Mark said " dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement."     Mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity. But what???  It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.     They want to penalize us if we dont run,  and if we do ,  we will lose money. We then file to get a break-even rebate.  They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.  I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.  I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.   I  do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore. We will be more vocal in this meeting.    If no resolution is reached,  I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions. I need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money.  Thanks,  JForney 
 Thank you Bill!  JMForney 
   David, I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:  Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal. The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.  The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.   Here is the problem: the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid. We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.  I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me "dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."    Here is my view: OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning. Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price. If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance. OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera. Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a "breakeven."   Ridiculous.  I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has "no comment." Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.  I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect. Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue. We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME." The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?  Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to OOME our plant."  Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.  Thanks,   JForney 37160 
 This is a start.   I am having our Regulatory guy review our OOMC/OOME situation.  Thanks, JForney 
 Please update your phone list with Frontera's new numbers.   They would prefer that we use the toll free number.  Thanks, JMF 
  Please check out the following.     The agreement I reached with Ercot/Frontera yesterday is as follows: When we receive an OOMC,  we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online. If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME,  then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.   We dont actually want to do this,  as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.  We will discuss further in the meeting.  Thanks, JMF 
 The latest from Frontera: They will not run unless we receive an OOME.  Call me if you need to,  but call before 10pm.  JMF 
   AJ, Thanks for checking in with me.   I had a couple of questions: Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?      I currently do several things: I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.    I also manage the Ercot Asset book.   I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas. I am required to trade gas along with  the power in order to properly hedge the plant. I would be interested in continuing in this area.  Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.   I could send my resume,  but if we dont have paralell needs,  then I wont bother. I have some other things that I am working on.  Thanks again for asking.  This company will be fine,  but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.   When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.   However,   although I am sure that Enron will bounce back,  I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.  I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.   I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company,  so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.  Anyway,  thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.  JMF 
 10-4 Thanks 
 Sure,  I am online everyday. I get in about 6 am, usually putting the numbers on at 6:30.   I start with hr ending 8-22 and change to 9-22 usually when the first interval of he 9 is printed. This is at my discretion. You may post a limit order (either a bid or offer) that covers mine and transact online.   You wont necessarily be trading with me,  another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid.  Let's trade it up!!!  JForney 
 Erik, deal no.  773763 has been changed. sorry for the confusion.  JMF 
 A lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc. No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up. You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed. Thanks, 
   Frontera was asked to generate 135 mw's for this day.    They were generating but our meter read was showing zero.    Ercot was also showing zero. Steve Olinde called and Frontera assured us that they were running. We will need to file a dispute for approx hours ending 1 - 7? I am not sure when the meter came back,  but it was ok when I came in this morning.  Thanks, JMF 
 Mark Patterson, our Rep,  called today to ask me if everything was resolved= to my satisfaction.    I relayed that I did talk to John Adams last night = and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    Th= is is great,  however,   Mark warned me that we were outside of the tariff = because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run. He relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.  = John Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of p= otential QSE liability.  In my opinion we need to: Call Ken Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwis= e we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest t= his ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability." Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.  Thanks, JForney 
 I kind of lost my temper a bit with Mark.   Probably wont sound good on tap= e,  but I told him that a monkey-man wouldnt interpret the protocols that w= ay. Its the Dynegy thang talking.  JMF 
   We are long 50 mw's  (ercot asset book) for the 2x16 .   This is scheduled into the North market.  JMF 
   We are long 50 mw's for 16 hours Saturday and Sunday.    The length is under the Ercot Asset book and the cost is $15.    I am concerned about Sunday morning,  specifically,  hours ending 7-11.   If you could sell  this for a decent price,  it would be a good thing.  The purchase is an interdesk deal,  so it wont show in Enpower Scheduling. Also,  for hours ending 15-20 on Sunday we are long an additional 100 mw's at $16.31.   The purchase is under deal #873330 from City of Austin.  The temps are supposed to be warm and it should be muggy on Sunday ahead of the cold front.    This is scheduled to the North Zone under Enpower 873332.  Either leave alone or sell under the Ercot Asset book.  For Monday,  we are long 50 mw's onpeak under another interdesk deal.   The length cannot be seen in Enpower scheduling.      This deal is under Ercot Asset and has been scheduled to load (north) under deal #873255.   Also,  we have another 100 mw's from COA (see Enpower #873330) for he 15-20. This is scheduled to north zone under enpower #873332.   Dont forget that the night crew will report to the new building Sunday evening.   The phones are to be inactivated here at 5:30 pm Sunday.   Thanks and lets trade it up!  JMF 
   Madhup, Any luck on developing this tool?   Also,   tell me the status of the Esca people.   The hourly trading system is not complete and I understand that they are leaving. No documentation on how to use the system is available,  as far as I can tell.  JMF 
   We are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.    OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt. Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.   I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.  Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.    Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.   So,  for the times that we were asked to run,  Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.  How far can we go back in a dispute?  I thought we were somewhat limited.  JMF 
 -- [Forney, John M.]  It appears that Ercot is reversing their interpretation.   We still need to dispute/collect for OOMC payments and also file under OOME heat rate provisions for all of the times that we ran when we were under OOMC. Does this make sense?  JMF 
   Jerry,  Please see the attached: 
 The instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us  by COA.   The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply, or how we would schedule intraday power. COA wants us to "split the meter" at the plant,  allowing us to schedule our own 100 mw's ( and assume all liability) and also arrange our own gas agreement. Otherwise,  they dont want to allow us intraday capability. The agreement doesnt expire until Nov 3, 2003.  Their would be two gas contracts to consider,  I suppose:  Enron needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to COA directly.  When do you want to talk?  JMF 
 So,  it would appear that we have a good case for recovering some money for OOME?   I am of the opinion that for every time I was ordered to run under the OOMC,  I should be paid the OOME calc. Is this flawed logic?  What do you think. JMF 
   We are short 50 mw's for offpeak tomorrow @ $13.    I would not expect to have to fill this,  but if you do,  buy in the South and schedule under Ercot Asset. We originally purchased this power from El Paso.  Call me with questions.  JMF 
 Tuesday good.   I am at 680 , where the heck are you?  JMF 
  Please check for your new Trid for your turret. Thanks, JMF 
 thanks jmf 
 The move has been very smooth 
  Gerald, I am talking with Gary Bryan.    You do need to be involved in this and I need your feedback. Come by when you get a chance.  thx., jmf 
   Kim, Has the Savings plan website changed?   I admit seeing a e-mail about the change of administrators,  but I didnt realize the website would be incapacitated. What's up? JMF 
  We are short on the offpeak for the three days including saturday,  sunday,  and monday.     We are floating 55 mw's   in the South zone. If you replace this power,  please remove the appropriate counterparty in the portal and replace with new counterparty.  Also:  The Frontera plant is currently NOT scheduled to run this weekend or Monday.    We are currently,  as of Friday,  experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.  These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred. We have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.   We have done so.  When the other units become available,   please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.    We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.  If you have questions,   give me a call.    JMF 
 Madhup, We still need to provide detail on when errors/ problems actually occur. I will work to get this to you by tomorrow. Thanks, JMF 
 thank you, you are one of my favorite hr reps 
  Madhup, here is some more specific detail, as promised.  Thanks, JMF 
 more detail jmf 
 thanks alex!! jmf 
   We have 25 mw's of length for the 8 hr offpeak block from thanksgiving through monday.   hours ending 23 & 24 have the most value.  This is your position,  leave in North pool or sell as necessary.  JMF 
   Ben, Our Ercot lines arent working.    We are located at desks 678-680. Also, could you please make the Ercot lines 1-4 appear on page 1 of all Ercot hourly traders phones? You did this for us in the old building,  but those changes didnt transfer.  The traders are: Joe Capasso Alex McElreath George Phillips Steve Olinde Seung-Tak Oh John Forney  Thanks, JMF 
 Mr Taylor, I have attached my resume, that explains what the heck I have been doing.   Let me know if anyone has interest in a profitable Woodlands boy.  Thanks! 
 When: Monday, September 17, 2001 11:00 AM-11:30 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: 3112f - Doug's desk  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
    Jerry, Please see the attached .     As I mentioned,   I will be out of the office visiting Ercot tomorrow.  Thanks,  JMF 
 Frank. The ancillary services market for non-spinning has been horrible.   Non- spinnning for today is,  at most,   90 cents/mw for hours 14-18.  The remaining hours are worth zero. The down regulation and up regulation markets are lucrative  at as much as $11.99/mw ,  but we are not certified for this service.     As I understand it,  there is some work necessary on the plant to allow us to sell up/down regulation and replacement.  GE personel were to travel to the plant and do some work,  but in light of world events,  I do not know if they have arrived. Once the upgrades are complete,   we need to restart the certification process with Ercot.  If we sell non-spin for .90,  we would need to withhold this power from the market.   We have been selling,  on a Real Time basis,   as much power as we can get out the door.   We have not been selling offpeak and we are starting schedules,  typically at hour 10 through 22 for a sales price of $24.  That is the latest.   We are currently looking at making sales in October.  The heat rate is around 10.7  Thanks,  JForney 
   Please see the attached.  JForney 
 Mikey - I heard that you have gotten married.   Is that true? JMF 
 just to double check;  the meeting is now on Monday,  right? 
 Carmen, Please note that my employee's correct name is Alex McElreath.  It was mispelled below.  Thank you, JForney 
   Please see the attached.    Remember that we are planning on buying hour ending 7 (50 mw's).    So,   we wont actually generate 250's as the schedule indicates. Alex will take care of this tonight.  Prices for the weekend look like: onpeak $20.75 offpeak $ 12.25 gas  $2.06 This doesnt look too good for the weekend run.    Let me know what you need to do.   Thanks,  JMF 
    For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report  The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.  Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.   Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp. So either : 1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book. Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7. 2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.  Call if you have questions.    JMF 
   For Monday,   it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera:  he 4 -30mw's he 5 - 30 mw's he 7 - 30 mw's he 23 - 85 mw's he 24 - 85 mw's   Also,   we need  to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.  We are not running the plant this weekend.    The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline. We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of. Also,  please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.  FYI - for OOM up,  we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.   For this weekend assume $2.05.   IF you can make hourly,  bal-day sales in excess of this,  check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.  Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend  for economics.   We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.   I will be out of town this weekend.   I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.  Thanks, JMF 
   We are long 100 mw's for hour ending 16-19 on Monday.   This is currently scheduled to load. If prices are poor,   we need to sell this energy early Monday morning for >   $22 if possible.  The sale goes into the Ercot Asset book.  Thanks, JMF 
   The position for Monday is currently scheduled into imbalance in both the QSE MOS and Enpower. Make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases.   Attached are the spreadsheets that reflect what Frontera is doing for the next three days.   Again,  look to the top line to know what generation output should be.  Know it,  learn it,   live it.  Thanks,  JMF 
   Laurel,  Do you have Ken Parker's e-mail address?   He needs to be copied on our preschedules. His address is kbparker@tecoenergy.com   Thanks, JMF 
  For tomorrow, we need to sell the following:  he 5 - 30mw's he 6 - 30mw's he 7 - 65 mw's  The sales go into the Teco Services book.    The length is currently scheduled to load in Enpower and the QSE MOS system.   Thanks,   JMF 
  Additionally, he 23 - please sell 35 mw's 
  We were down balanced in excess of what we were willing to pay,  as indicated by our bidding structure.   It seems that their software is not recognizing our bids. Our Ercot Rep, Mark Patterson is looking into this. We will dispute down balancing bills for the labor day weekend,  as this problem persisted every day.  Thanks, JMF 
   Mark, Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO. He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.  We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.  However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market. The replacement reserve prices have been zero.  Could you provide some help on this?  Thanks,  J Forney 
  Andrea, apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.    I show negative new deal value for Teco Services,  when I sold above the curve on their behalf. I assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value.  The deal has been revised,  as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.   This imbal. sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.  Will I ever get a true up for the negative new deal value?  JMF 
  fyi  jmf 
 Ken, Laurel will be sending the spreadsheet from now on.   I asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution. I will be out of the office next week.   Clint Dean will step in for me.  Thanks, JMF 
 I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest. They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.  The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN. He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.  Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the Harris county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case. She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.  Life is less fair to dumbasses  JMF

 im sorry - im kinda shifty............ 
   Hello, I am using MSN dial up through the Enron program.  I understood it to be a $5 co-pay.    MSN customer service has said that they are billing me $25/month for this service and they dont know anything about an Enron special program. Who can I contact to resolve this issue?  John Forney Director, Ercot Power Trading 
 Yes, My member id is fourknees  . I am being billed $21.95/ month since inception of May 11, 2001.  Thanks for your help.  JMF

   We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire. We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled. Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.  This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day,  etc.   Thanks, JMF 
  FYI, This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.  The point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.   Please see the e-mail below from Alan.  JMF 
   Until further,  it is best to avoid long positions in the morning hours that are to liquidate against the balancing market.    The downside is $1000 and the upside maybe $10.   Thanks, JMF 
  Steve indicated below that he talked to Ken at Frontera.   Ken Parker is the "new" Jerry.     They are staffing up.  JMF 
 O - the file should be m:electric/eservices/ees/ercot/ees model   go get em,  JMF 
   Duong,  Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:  For every counterparty "Ercot Imbalance" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to "off"  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.  What do you think?  JForney

   Ken, As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.  I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.  The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.    Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers. I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.  Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.   Let me know what you think,  JForney 713-853-7160 
  Rebecca, For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours. I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :  he7 - 310 mw's he8 - 310 he 9- 240 he10 - 140 he 11 - 60  Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day.. This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.  Thanks, JMF 
 Thanks for looking into this.  JMF 
   We have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours 7-11 for $20.   They sold a 340 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow. They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following:  He7,8  - 30mw's He 9  - 100 HE 10 - 200 HE 11 -280  So,  basically,  they will be dragging significantly for these hours.    We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price. The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.  Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.    Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.   Thanks,  JMF 
 we put it on for tomorrow.   i am short the pool at $20. i gave them an agressive bid and i think that we will both win.  jmf 
   Tom, Frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow.   I am really excited about getting this product off.    I guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now.  Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera:  September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75.   This was a 10.72 heat rate.       I had to take off for an Austin trip and Clint took over for me in trying to get them to transact. Power moved down,  but so did gas,   The heat rate was the same,  but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75.    Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2.  I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5  heat rate.   The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr.   August (late) - Clint proposed selling 12.7  heat rate in September .   They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market.  This didnt work out.  On a daily basis,  Frontera has a problem making timely decisions.   For example,   I give them gas prices and daily prices.   They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day.   I tell them that I will bookout my option. They call back later and say that they would like to run.     Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible.  On Tuesday,   I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for  a $1.25 premium.    This would have at least brought in $23,000.   They werent interested in this idea.  I communicate my feelings on the market very early.   If they could react quicker,   I would smack the first bids that showed their faces,  including EOL. I could have taken out 200mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks.   Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay.   He will be sending another e-mail.   This relationship,  although not initially profitable,  has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible.   I dont really want to lose the job.   We are providing some outstanding support, in my opinion.  The thing that weakens our case is that Ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the OOM payments. The settlements extract,  as I learned on my trip,  is key to explainnig this value.     The OOM value itself is well over $200k.  Good luck!  JMF 
 In this case,    Ercot Asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance.   The enpower deals listed below are under this desk. The financial swap info is going out,  Frontera being the most logical first customer.  Is there anything else from us that you would want?   Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera,  etc.  Let me know what you think.  JMF 
   Mark, We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services;       Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis. We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.  For example,  on 9/27,   Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.      Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour. The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.  Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?  I will be out of the office next week,   so can you reply to Doug Gilbert-Smith?   His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com. Otherwise,  he can be reached at 713-853-9310.   Thanks for your help!  JForney 
 Larry, I will be on vacation next week.   I will not be available until Monday,  October 8th.  Thanks,  JMF 
   TJ, I will be on vacation next week.   I will be checking in via cell phone.  Thanks,.  JForney 
   Jerry, Please see tomorrow's schedules as attached: 
   I will be on vacation next week, October 1-5th.   In my absence ,  contact Clint Dean or Smith Day for any questions related to Frontera,  etc.  Feel free to wake Clint up for any reason.  Thanks,  JMF 
 I saw the memo.   It is true about the startup charges.   It is listed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?  Thanks, JMF 
 TJ, Could you tell me what my balance is for vacation days?   Also,  I dont thi= nk that I have signed up for the floating holiday yet.   Would this balance= reflect that?  Thank you! JMF 
   I have received notice that I need to attend the Sandhill board of directors meeting tomorrow.   Clint Dean will be trading the Asset book. I will be available via cell phone.  Thanks, JMF 
 that is correct  jmf 
   Mark, Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments. Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by awaiting instruction.  Has there been any progress in this subject?  JForney 
   Due to the slowdown in trading,   I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around. These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.    This will make more sense,  once you inherit the position.  The following positions need to be watched for monday:  1.     We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.     We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time. They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.   This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.  If you are working Sunday night,   check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.   It is very common that they get a bad "handoff" and are unaware of this transaction.     Give them plenty of time to work this out.  We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X  and a sale to Mirant.    In Enpower,  buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).   Enter this as a flat transaction,  ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.   2.    The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.    Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.     I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.    I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.    I think also that some larger units are coming off line,  which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.   Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.       Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5,  offpeak is trading $11.25. Where is the value???   Lets  trade it up!   JMF 
   Isaac needs to be set up with a certificate for the Ercot Portal.    Is there a form I need to fill out for this?   JMF 
   Ben,  My new employee,  Isaac Wong,   needs a turret id.    He will need to copy someone else's phone list as well. Can you help?  Thanks,  JMF 
 thanks harley man
