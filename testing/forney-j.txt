 you provide some help on this?  Thanks,  J Forney 
  Andrea, apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.    I show negative new deal value for Teco Services,  when I sold above the curve on their behalf. I assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value.  The deal has been revised,  as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.   This imbal. sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.  Will I ever get a true up for the negative new deal value?  JMF

 Ken, Laurel will be sending the spreadsheet from now on.   I asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution. I will be out of the office next week.   Clint Dean will step in for me.  Thanks, JMF 
 I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest. They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.  The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN. He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.  Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the Harris county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case. She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.  Life is less fair to dumbasses  JMF

   Hello, I am using MSN dial up through the Enron program.  I understood it to be a $5 co-pay.    MSN customer service has said that they are billing me $25/month for this service and they dont know anything about an Enron special program. Who can I contact to resolve this issue?  John Forney Director, Ercot Power Trading 
 Yes, My member id is fourknees  . I am being billed $21.95/ month since inception of May 11, 2001.  Thanks for your help.  JMF

   We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire. We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled. Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.  This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day,  etc.   Thanks, JMF 
  FYI, This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.  The point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.   Please see the e-mail below from Alan.  JMF 
   Until further,  it is best to avoid long positions in the morning hours that are to liquidate against the balancing market.    The downside is $1000 and the upside maybe $10.   Thanks, JMF 
  Steve indicated below that he talked to Ken at Frontera.   Ken Parker is the "new" Jerry.     They are staffing up.  JMF

   Duong,  Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:  For every counterparty "Ercot Imbalance" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to "off"  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.  What do you think?  JForney

   Ken, As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.  I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.  The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.    Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers. I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.  Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.   Let me know what you think,  JForney 713-853-7160 
  Rebecca, For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours. I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :  he7 - 310 mw's he8 - 310 he 9- 240 he10 - 140 he 11 - 60  Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day.. This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.  Thanks, JMF 
 Thanks for looking into this.  JMF 
   We have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours 7-11 for $20.   They sold a 340 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow. They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following:  He7,8  - 30mw's He 9  - 100 HE 10 - 200 HE 11 -280  So,  basically,  they will be dragging significantly for these hours.    We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price. The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.  Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.    Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.   Thanks,  JMF 
 we put it on for tomorrow.   i am short the pool at $20. i gave them an agressive bid and i think that we will both win.  jmf 
   Tom, Frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow.   I am really excited about getting this product off.    I guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now.  Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera:  September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75.   This was a 10.72 heat rate.       I had to take off for an Austin trip and Clint took over for me in trying to get them to transact. Power moved down,  but so did gas,   The heat rate was the same,  but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75.    Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2.  I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5  heat rate.   The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr.   August (late) - Clint proposed selling 12.7  heat rate in September .   They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market.  This didnt work out.  On a daily basis,  Frontera has a problem making timely decisions.   For example,   I give them gas prices and daily prices.   They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day.   I tell them that I will bookout my option. They call back later and say that they would like to run.     Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible.  On Tuesday,   I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for  a $1.25 premium.    This would have at least brought in $23,000.   They werent interested in this idea.  I communicate my feelings on the market very early.   If they could react quicker,   I would smack the first bids that showed their faces,  including EOL. I could have taken out 200mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks.   Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay.   He will be sending another e-mail.   This relationship,  although not initially profitable,  has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible.   I dont really want to lose the job.   We are providing some outstanding support, in my opinion.  The thing that weakens our case is that Ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the OOM payments. The settlements extract,  as I learned on my trip,  is key to explainnig this value.     The OOM value itself is well over $200k.  Good luck!  JMF 
 In this case,    Ercot Asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance.   The enpower deals listed below are under this desk. The financial swap info is going out,  Frontera being the most logical first customer.  Is there anything else from us that you would want?   Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera,  etc.  Let me know what you think.  JMF 
   Mark, We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services;       Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis. We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.  For example,  on 9/27,   Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.      Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour. The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.  Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?  I will be out of the office next week,   so can you reply to Doug Gilbert-Smith?   His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com. Otherwise,  he can be reached at 713-853-9310.   Thanks for your help!  JForney 
 Larry, I will be on vacation next week.   I will not be available until Monday,  October 8th.  Thanks,  JMF 
   TJ, I will be on vacation next week.   I will be checking in via cell phone.  Thanks,.  JForney 
   Jerry, Please see tomorrow's schedules as attached: 
   I will be on vacation next week, October 1-5th.   In my absence ,  contact Clint Dean or Smith Day for any questions related to Frontera,  etc.  Feel free to wake Clint up for any reason.  Thanks,  JMF 
 I saw the memo.   It is true about the startup charges.   It is listed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?  Thanks, JMF 
 TJ, Could you tell me what my balance is for vacation days?   Also,  I dont thi= nk that I have signed up for the floating holiday yet.   Would this balance= reflect that?  Thank you! JMF 
   I have received notice that I need to attend the Sandhill board of directors meeting tomorrow.   Clint Dean will be trading the Asset book. I will be available via cell phone.  Thanks, JMF 
 that is correct  jmf 
   Mark, Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments. Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by awaiting instruction.  Has there been any progress in this subject?  JForney 
   Due to the slowdown in trading,   I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around. These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.    This will make more sense,  once you inherit the position.  The following positions need to be watched for monday:  1.     We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.     We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time. They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.   This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.  If you are working Sunday night,   check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.   It is very common that they get a bad "handoff" and are unaware of this transaction.     Give them plenty of time to work this out.  We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X  and a sale to Mirant.    In Enpower,  buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).   Enter this as a flat transaction,  ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.   2.    The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.    Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.     I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.    I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.    I think also that some larger units are coming off line,  which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.   Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.       Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5,  offpeak is trading $11.25. Where is the value???   Lets  trade it up!   JMF 
   Isaac needs to be set up with a certificate for the Ercot Portal.    Is there a form I need to fill out for this?   JMF 
   Ben,  My new employee,  Isaac Wong,   needs a turret id.    He will need to copy someone else's phone list as well. Can you help?  Thanks,  JMF 
 thanks harley man
