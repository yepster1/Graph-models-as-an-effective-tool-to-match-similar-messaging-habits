 Bobby - How's it going in PDX?     Things very different here in this "market."    It is difficult to trade against monopoly power.      Book currently melting down,  however,  things are turning around.       Here;   nuke goes down,  very hot weather............. prices tank.     The transmission is controlled by utility rednecks who load up the capacity,   driving up prices,  and they release the capacity in mid trading,  crushing the dailies.    We cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner.       Pig forkers! Anyway,  I havent been accepted into the bubba club yet,   but I'm still trying.    Presto and the other traders call my region "Jimmy land,"  as most of the players are rednecks named Jimmy.  Hope the wife and Floyd are doing well.     Lot's of bad golf being played here!  Let me know when you are coming down - we will drink tequila at the Cadillac Bar.  JMF 
 John - How is business?   Things not as fun here as PDX. I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate:    1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.    It has 64k and the interior is flawless. The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips,  etc in the front.    The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well. The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.     It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.  Heres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.  Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k. What am I missing here?  Thanks, JMF 
 Mikey, Please see the attached and tell me if I am smoking crack.      This calc would show me eating the difference between the purchase and sale prices,  although I have no position on this day.    You can go into the tab marked "May1."  Thanks, JMF 
 TJ, I need tickets to an Astros game  on May 18th.     We will be entertaining 7 people from Entergy and approx.   5 Enron people. Is there access to a box or,  at least,  blocks of seats together?  Thanks, JMF 
 I have purchased from Duke   100 mw's at $51  for flow into Entergy (see deal#591863) .       Duke is  transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO.     In the event of TLR's,   we have the option of cutting this supply,   without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar). If this happens,  of course  you need to fill the demand side and cut the purchase from Duke in enpower - see deal no. above.   The purchases  go in the ST SPP book.  Once again,  If RT has to intervene,  please make sure that Enpower is balanced with respect to ST SPP.     Also,   let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have.  You guys are doing a good job.  JMF 
   We have purchased 65 mw's from Teco for hour ending 6 on Monday for $5.    This is scheduled into the North Zone. If prices dictate,   sell to another counterparty.      See deal no.  767454   Thanks, JMF 
 Judy, I was accidently included on the distribution list for the retirement announcement from Omaha.     My name is John Forney and my family is from Crete Nebraska.   My grandfather,   Lester Forney,   was a doctor in Lincoln.      Any relation,  as I dont hear our last name very often?  JForney Enron Power Trading 
 Kim, Can we meet around noon?  JMF 
 That would be fine - just give me a call and let me know when you can meet. JMF 
 You are down.  JMF 
 Hey, looks like I will be returning to Portland.    They want me back and it is a much better place to work.       HR is wanting me to consider other opportunities in Houston,  however.     They have one week to come up with something,  otherwise I'm outta here.  Other companies are paying ridiculous sums to experienced West traders (California experience). Thanks for considering me for your group and I'll keep you updated.  JMF 
  Kim, Thanks for spending time with me yesterday.   I have spoken with Tom May concerning what my status was.   I mentioned that my preference would be to return to Portland,  however,  I would be considering other options within the company for one week. My thought was that I need to relay this same message to Presto,  Doug and Lloyd.     I will communicate this today,  unless you have other ideas.  As discussed,  I have attached a copy of my resume.   It is getting kind of long,  but I havent really gotten a chance to "abbreviate."  Thanks again for helping, JMF 
  It looks like we will be moving back to Portland before summer starts.     The job didnt turn out as promised and I was put into a role that I didnt want. Oh well.    The Portland team still wants me and has offered 4 different roles to choose from. You cant beat that.  Anyway,  I will let you know how it turns out.  JMF 
 I will come by sometime after 8:30 am if that is okay.  Thanks! JMF 
  Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     Hope she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  "how is the baby?"   versus "where is the baby?" But,  as Kim used to say,  "enough about you,   let's talk about me."   I spoke with Tim B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.  The HR department here in Houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within Houston and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.  Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.  I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.  Thanks, JMF 
 Amy, Hope everything is going well with you.   I dont know if Tim has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland. I am talking with Wolfe and Tim,  but I would like to keep things low key.    I know this all seems pretty weird,   but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major,  immediate decisions to make.    Basically,   the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real Time,  similar to how we did it in Portland. Unfortunately,  that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).     Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had,  I never would have left.  Anyway,  Kim Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within Enron Houston and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.   She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.    However,  I have expressed  to Kevin and Kim that my first preference would be to return to Portland.  I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here. I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.     I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.  Thanks, JMF  I 
 correct 
  Bart, que paso,   juaro? Jeff passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   "Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,"....  Go beetles! I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths. Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me.............. the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........  (Please keep this confidential) Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision
