ity. Are we supposed to be ready today and if yes,  for what?  JMF 
   Iz - Please see the attached work schedule for Sept.    I have you officially joining the group on Wednesday,  however,  your actual shift work begins on Thursday,   September 13th.  If you have any questions,   give me a call at 3-7160.  We look forward to having you on the team.  JForney 
   Ercot hourly will need four tickets for thursday's game.  The attendees:  Eric Saibi Alex McElreath Myself Steve Olinde   Thanks, JMF 
  Tom, I am available: July 11th & 12th.     July 23-27th.  Also the 30th & 31st.  I am available most anytime in Augie,  as I havent put together the shift schedule yet.  JMF 
   I will be out of the office this  Friday,  next  Monday and Tuesday.   I will be taking some vacation days. I will be checking in and I will be available by cell phone.   thanks, JMF 
 I agree and will make the arrangements.  JMF 
   Tony,  My logon and password :  jforney bmw528i!  Thanks, JMF 
 Check out this site. Dont look for job opportunities,  however.  JMF 
   Settlements and Risk have blessed our version of the procedures.    Now we need to run this by Teco. Should I call Frank Busot to discuss,  or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on Tuesday?  We have already received their invoice for June and they have again invoiced us at the sales price, rather than the minimum market price.  I will be involving Clint in the reconciliation to give him some exposure to this side.  What do you think?  JMF 
   Tj, Can you price a flight for me to Tampa that would leave from Hobby airport?    The meetnig is on Tuesday and I could leave either Monday night or Tuesday morning. I could take an afternoon flight from Tampa to Houston Hobby.   Thanks,.  JMF 
   We are long 65 mw's from Frontera at $5 for tomorrow.   It is scheduled into the North 2001. Sell if needed.   JMF 
   Brett, I have a business question,  for a change.   Ercot load is forecast to be as high as 46,124 for hour ending 1200 today.   The actual printed from the website is less than 43,000.   I know that there is South to North congestion,   but is this actual load right?    Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?  Any help you can give would be appreciated.   I dont think that this is proprietary info or anything.    I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless.  Thanks, JMF 
   Please make the following arrangements for me in order to join Tom and Jeff in Tampa for the Teco meeting:  7/16 - Depart Hobby to Tampa at 7:50pm flight. Stay at Hyatt - Jeff Miller has made the arrangements already.  7/17 - Depart Tampa 4:30, arrive Houston 6:35pm.     I will  be calling on Friday to check on this.   Remember,  I will be on vacation Friday and Monday.   I was scheduled to take Tuesday off, but I will have to attend this meeting. Please do not schedule a vacation day for me on Tuesday.   Thanks, JForney 
 Thanks for remembering me.  Hope everythnig is well with you too!  JMF

  Lloyd, a couple of questions: Will Joe Capasso be aggreeable to start in my group on August 1st?    That would be awesome.    Let me know if I can help with anything on this  What is the status of the personal best award recommendation for Errigo and Olinde?  Thanks, JMF 
   Please use the following:  Cell -  813-760-7199 Office - 813-228-4907 (should roll over to his cell after hours) second line in home:  813-634-7772   We have had problems locating Jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes.   He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work.    In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation.    They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry.  The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions.   JMF 
  Lloyd, here is another Bryan guy.   Pretty much the same length of service as Kevin.   JMF 
    Stephanie McHargue will be backing up Jerry Watson this weekend.   She will be another contact person available to us if we cannot contact Jerry.  Her numbers:  cell:   813-293-0700 home:   727-522-6741 pager:   813-266-8044  Remember to call her this weekend with any Frontera changes.  Thanks, JMF 
 TJ - Alex doesnt have access to Lotus Notes.  Can we get a request in for him?   We use Notes to communicate within the Scheduling and RT groups.   Thanks, JMF 
   Jerry see the attached.   Ercot has your direct line (cell) for down balancing today.    We are evacuating.  My cell number is 713-412-7529  Call  me if you need anything.   Thanks! 
   From time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions. If you recognize someone from another firm,  or know who they are,  do not discuss their interest in Enron with anyone else.  Recently,  we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with Enron.  Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.    Totally unacceptable.     I have to ensure that this information is not coming from  my group, hence this note.  Common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.   If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.  Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.  JForney 
  Steve, Check this out-  does this have any truth to it? JMF 
   Corry, Can you add me as a trader in Enpower under Ercot Asset?    Also,  please add Alex McElreath as a trader under Teco Services. Additionally,   Alex is not able to get into Lotus Notes and, ultimately,   East Power Scheduling Discussion. Jeff Miller needs access to East Power discussion - he has Lotus Notes.  Thanks, JMF 
 Lloyd, I spoke with Steve directly about Kevin's e-mail and concerns.    Steve said that Dan of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     Steve did mention to Dan that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    Dan,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   Dan and Brandon sent their resumes.  I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and Steve has apologized.  How do you feel about this: if we hire Kevin,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and Kevin could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that Kevin may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.  Let me know - sorry for the very awkward  situation.  JMF 
 Had to copy you on this......dont be offended,  my friend is from Shreveport. JMF 
   Jerry, Take a look and check to see if I missed anything.    Also,  I would assume that you have some additional energy to sell for hour ending 7&8  and he 22.   Is that true?  Thanks, JMF 
   Jerry, Lets try this one: 
   I am scheduled to be out of the office for a few days in late August.    The dates are specifically 8/22, 23 and 24th.  Thanks, JMF 
 Lloyd,  Do you have time to meet with George at noon today?   I am going to talk with him again at this time.  JMF 
 Michael, how do you know which deals are the options if they are entered as forwards? I input into the comments,  but I was about to ask how these options get trued up.  Thanks, JMF 
 Hour ending 3 for 5 mw's has been confirmed with HLP. HE 3  was 60 mw's originally,  but was cut intra hour.   The integrate mw's are 10mw'w and are reflected on revised oasis request 4405.  HLP agrees with this.  JMF 
   Amy, How's it going?    I was wondering how Jeremy was doing.      Is there anything I can help with on an "unofficial" basis? It would seem that he has a decision to make,  though I havent heard of his progress lately.  Did you have your vacation yet?  JMF 
  Lloyd, George has departed for his planned vacation.   He will be back on the 30th, per his voice mail. I bring him in at that time.    JMF 
   Please see the attached that weve discussed.  Please note what is contained on the sheets on the bottom of the tool.  Thanks, JMF 
   We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule. For example,   when we have availability,    or even "must sell"  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem.  They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.   For now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door. In Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.   Thanks, JMForney 
   Pete, Do me a favor;   e-mail me your question and I'll work to get an "official" answer.      Remember that although we will get an answer,   the invoice may appear somewhat different. Of course,  the tariff overrules any answer that we may receive.  Thanks, JMF 
   The internet address for the Ercot Portal:  https://portla.ercot.com 
   Samuel, Please add the following names to the list of traders that have access to the new Ercot Imbalance and EPMI Ercotpool counterparties:  Eric Saibi Alex McElreath Joe Errigo Steve Olinde Joe Capasso Jeff Miller  We will need to add more in the near future.   Please let me know when this is completed.  Thanks, JForney 3-7160 
 George, Give me a call and we will further discuss opportunities on the 13st floor.  Thanks, JMForney 3-7160 
 When do you want to come?  The wife and I are expecting you and Richter this week. I will be working some nasty hours this week due to the new market opening.  Let me know.....  JMF 
   Jerry, Please see the attached:  JMF 
   TJ - How many spots does the Ercot RT group have for the LV trip in October?  JMF 
  Lloyd, We received this from Preston.     Everyone on this distribution list would assume that EES is waiting on information from us. We are still awaiting meaningful data from Narsimha/Preston. I am going to discuss this with Narsimha. I feel like a reply is warranted,  as we are making no headway on this project.  I fear for Preston if he is to work with me in the future.  JMF 
  Lloyd, FYI  JMF 
   Rogers, Customers call 	quite often to inquire about Retail Service.    Is there a single contact person that we can transfer them to? I talk to someone different each time from EES. I'd like to get a procedure in place for the floor so no one gets lost frmo the outside.  Let me know what you think,  JMF 
 Hourly deals should be under Teco SVC the majority of the time.    However,  at times Enron's option (under Ercot Asset book)  will be long into the Real Time market. This is Frontera generation,  but Enron bought it in the form of the option. You will see deals of this type for today under the Ercot Asset.  So hourly deals: Teco Services - 99% of time Ercot Asset - 1 % Hrly Ercot - NEVER

  Lloyd, I received this from Preston.    It appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch. We were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that EES was to provide. We havent received the necessary information,  so no choice has been made yet.  Please see the attached and let me know your comments.  JMF 
 Scott, I heard that the TPC was in decent shape.    Are you planning on playing on Saturday in the morning or afternoon? How many people do you have in the group?  JForney 713-853-7160 
    Jerrry,  See the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.    We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the	OOM  (Out of Merit)  decrease for today.   It is our understanding,  per the protocols,  that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35  scheduled sale  whole.    We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of:  the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.    If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive: $35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.  For the capacity tomorrow, We will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.    The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.    The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed. At the time of deployment,  we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised. We bid in a  Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 ".   They can take partial hours, at their option.  I hope this helps.  JFORNEY Director, EPMI 
  Jerry, Please disregard the explanation of the OOM power settlement.     The ISO called us at 7:15 pm and explained a different scenario altogether.   We need to discuss this further. Sorry for the confusion.  JForney 
 Thanks for your reply. Here's what I have learned from our conversation: Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were "captured" by Don and Juan's group? I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots. I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.  Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.  I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?  JMF 
   Ben, Could you come by,  I have a question about rearranging our phone turrets.  Thanks, JMForney 
 Scott, The wife is out of town until Saturday night.    I can play alot of golf on Saturday,  but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday.     I will be available for the golf marathon on Saturday.    I have one player for Saturday morning,  but I dont have a player for Sat. afternoon yet, although I have another co-worker who is interested. Should I fill this spot as well?  JMF 
 youre an animal  jmf 
 cant even go to the head.  thanks for the offer anyway.  JMF 
  Ben, as discussed,  please move the four Ercot lines to the front page for the listed people below.       Also,  to the extent possible,   add the E lines.  These guys are prioritized as follows:  John Forney Eric Saibi Steve Olinde Joe Capasso (new to group) Alex McElreath Jeff Miller Smith Day Joe Errigo 
   Dahlke,  I purchased a gas deal,   10,000 mmbtud - HSC for 7/10-7/31 for $3.15.   I bought this through Doug G-S. Wont you take the final prints for each day and calc profitability for me,  or how do you do this?  Please give me some money  JMF 
 HOW WAS THE TRADITION COURSE?  ARE YOU GOLFED OUT YET?    I DIDNT DO ANYTHING SATURDAY NIGHT.  JMF 
 Rebecca, We have heard that the resource imbalance was pretty high.     We will discuss this with you.   We definitely dont want to talk to Teco/Frontera until we get a handle on this. We will come by this afternoon.  JMF 
 I left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question. Could you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail? If I cannot answer the question,  then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep.  The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed. This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.  Let me know what you have.  JMF 3-7160 
 TJ: Please make sure that the Ercot RC is not billed for our portion of the customer trip.   If I can assist with this accounting,  let me know.    I dont wish to subsidize the other Hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense.  In the future,   I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group. I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.  I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.   We werent able to secure a commitment from customers,  but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).    I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip did not change,  rather the allocation to each group was changed.  My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything. But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank,  profitability and that I have been here 8 years. I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.  JMF 
   Johnny, What is the status of George?   I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.   George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time. Lloyd is out of town until Monday,  so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.   Thanks, JForney 3/7160 
  Johnny, I just received this from Lloyd.   I dont want to cause any double coverage by HR, so you might want to check with Kim. Thanks! 
  Mark, I called earlier today and left a lengthy phone message........sor
