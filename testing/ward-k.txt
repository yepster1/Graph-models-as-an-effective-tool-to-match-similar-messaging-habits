, and Donna? 
 you still here? 
 please remove my email address from your distribution list. 
 Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?  And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help me put together the confirmation?  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems.  All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have.  I have no idea what flows.  I hope Patti can help you soon.  Let me know if you don't hear from her today.  Thanks,  Kim 
 thats fine - we can't pay them anyway 
 Are you going to hang out with me and Camille tonight? 
 Jack,  Thanks so much for the message.  You are right, we are still a great trading organization.  Unfortunately, we had some people outside this organization make mistakes.  As for Tuesday, lets play it by ear.  I think we will continue to be a business and I still consider you a great customer.  Call me when you get into town and I will have a lot more information to share.  Thanks again for your email -  Kim 
 This makes 8 
 why are they doing this? 
 So do we have a special agreement in place for the full requirements gas deal?  I think that you did that deal before I came to the gas desk.  How can I get a copy of the penalty language?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Please remove me from your email distribution list. 
 Mr. Dossett,  I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!  And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win?  Kim 
 Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim

 Dan Hyvl - we sent them a draft two/three weeks ago. 
 Bob,  I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.  Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 I told you 
 As you probobly knew, Camille is gone.  I missed working out with Dean this morning - oh well.  Thought you might want to know about Camille. 
 e.  Here's my stuff - 3110 lake St. Houston, 77098.  713-526-7117.  kward1@houston.rr.com.  Good Luck and please keep in touch.  Kim

  Jeanie,  I would like to change my United Way contribution to zero and it looks like Kathy is no longer with us.  Who should I send my request to at this point?  Thanks,  Kim 
 did you put that on my desk? 
 Cliff,  For gas day December 6, 2001, Enron did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.  I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.  Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.  The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.  Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 AS we discussed. 
 Some of you may have gotten a similar email before but it seems as though it is appropriate once again - I just wanted to pass on my personal information so that any of you can get in touch with me through a mean others than Enron -  3110 Lake Street Houston,TX  77098 713-526-7117 (home) 713-412-4571 (cell) kward1@houston.rr.com  Please keep in touch!

 Ann,  Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.  The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.  Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685

 Megan,  Mara has been terminated so I looked in our files and found a spreadsheet for November.  However, it doesn't have the volumes filled in. Shannon Groenewald should be able to provide you with the actual volumes and all you should have to do is add them to this spreadsheet.  I have copied Shannon on this email so she should expect to hear from you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 It was painful !  Actually made it through an airplane flight, 2 meetings, a reception, and dinner!! 
 Yonnie,  I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!  We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!  Talk to you later -  Love,  Kim 
 check out the following websites for airfare:  www.orbitz.com - the best so far. www.cheaptickets.com www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer  register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform  Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.  Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.  Don't forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter)  p.s.  If you want to see how UN attractive my friends are - we are going to be a the wine bucket (new place - W. Alabama just east of Kirby) at 6 pm tonight.  Suzanne, Camille, Jeanie, Lori, Elizabeth.  You can check Camille out for yourself.  Bring others along.

Thanks for thinking of me and for the invitation.  Maybe some other weekend - I do hope to see you again soon.  Kim 
 Darla,  As far as I can tell, Craig's requests are ok.  Also, the NSP and gelber invoices you sent me look ok.  I am attaching my manual spreadsheet for the deals I have done from August forward.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Remember to use this spreadsheet in conjunction with what is in the system.  Mara,  I am just sending you this spreadsheet.  This has nothing to do with the Griffith deal.  We can discuss later.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chino plant 100% down = 80 MW Bagdad plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw Cerrito plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw  Basically 120 -150 MW offline due to PDs decrease in producion.  the same percentage decrease in gas demand is what we should see.  Let me know if you would like us to investigate this further.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks, Kim - for always sending me my stray emails!  Have a good day (or night)  Kim

 J.,  Where are we with this process?  Did you ever get whatever info Sara needed to her?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Since I have my long vacation in January, the less time I have to take off, the better - so I think a long holiday weekend would be good.  Let me know!  Kim 
 chris,  Here is what is going on with Citizens right now:  1)  Mike Grigsby and Randy Gay are reviewing the revisions to the Griffith contract from their perspective.  I will have Patti review it once they are done.  I looked at your peaking language and was not able to enhance it.  However, does the new calculation address any unanticipated pipeline rate changes such that the demand margin or sales margin could be negetive? 2)  interuptible gas will flow right now to Nogales from the Waha pool, according to Pattie 3)  I am attaching a summary of the conference call we had on the 18th and would like your input before sending it out. 4) the capacity release was posted and matched successfully.  Let me know ifyou have any questions.  thanks,  Kim 
 Hey Jeanie,  thanks for the invite.  Please keep me posted.  Last night was fun.  Had just the right amount of trick or treaters to have one piece of candy left over for each of us!  Kimmie 
 are we going to work out with Dean tomarrow? 
 when? 
 ok 
  Gentlemen,  I haven't heard from anyone regarding LDWP's request listed below.  We have to reply by next week. What is the status?  There is an article in the NGI publication today.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kim 
 Chris,  If you have a minute, will you look at this term sheet?  His volumes are really small but if we get the Palo Alto deal it won't be that big of a deal - unless we have to schedule less than 1 MMBtu. Oh yo!  His average daily volume, for both plants is about 178/day, based on annual usage.  I have proposed basically a GD deal with a first of the month index option if he can set a BDQ.  Thanks in advance.  Kim 
 I forgot to mention that Scott Masuda of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power will be in our offices on Monday afternoon.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Gerald,  I sent the following email to Jeff Hodge and Jason Williams on October 25th ad have heard nothing.  I reminded them this morning as we need to reply by mid next week.  Also, LDWP will be in our offices Monday afternoon.  Is this something that you can address faster than Jeff?  If so, just let him know and let me know how to proceed.  There was an article in the NGI publication this morning regarding this.  Thanks,  Kim 
 You're welcome.  I hope all is going well with you. 
 I did know all of that - talked to her just the other day.  I will miss her too!  Let me know if, when you need anything.  Kim 
 lets go now 
 Hello.  sorry I missed you last night ( and Saturday night!)  That football game I watched had 7 (a record) Overtimes!  The game lasted until about 10:30 and my team lost.  Very sad.  JDA and I went to Berryhill to meet Matt last night and I thought you would be there.  Is everything OK with you?  K. 
 attached are my changes 
 Sure you can stay at my house!  I will try to join you Thursday nite as well.  Things have been pretty shitty lately - with work, with the love life, and a huge sinus infection.  Hopefully things will be looking up by then!  Please make yourself at home!  You can come and go as you need.  Kim

 Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches!  Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.  K.

 Houston has actually been nice - hasn't gone above 85 and it is great to sit outside at night.  Anyway, you work too much and need to think about getting a life!!  We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.  I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!  Take care,  Kim 
 Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.  Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685

 I don't know what to do.  Boss says I don't need to look for a job and they will have to find some $$ to keep people. don't know that I want to be among the 7000 enron employees beating the streets.   Any suggestions?  there have been no formal announcements of layoffs but Logically, I feel like about 50% of my friends here will loose their jobs.  Especially the ones not associated with gas or power.  The world is in turmoil!  Wish I had my sailboat and 6 mos. $$ to live on - I would go to the caribbean and stay for a while. 
 Hi Joan - yes it is me, your long lost cousin!  You probobly got my address off of something that my mom sent around.  How are things with you?  As you probobly knew, I am back in Houston - which is very good as my company just announced a merger on Friday.  Worried about many of my friends but I am not so worried about loosing my job.  The world is certainly in turmoil!  Hope all is well with you and your family.  Keep in touch -  Kim 
 Hey!  The leg is healing nicely, thank you.  It did turn a little blue but I think I will live!  I say we are serious about the party but I have forwarded this to Suzanne to make sure she is on board.  I will keep you posted as things develop!  Hope to see you again soon -  Kim

 that is exactly it - and it worked for me today.  kward1@houston.rr.com.  try it again and let me know if you have a problem.  did you have fun with the guy you met out friday?  I would like to visit austin sometime.  Hopefully soon!  Thanks for the offer.  I will be in touch soon - and you are welcome to stay with me anytime!  take care,  Kim 
 Hey Lyndon,  It was nice to hear from you.  We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!  Things here have been changing by the day.  To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that Kim 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!  How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -  Kim 
 Gerald,  Thanks for looking at this for us.  When do you think you will have a chance to review it?  I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.  Also, do we need to have credit re-review?  Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.  Thanks,  Kim 
 MJ,  How are you doing?  Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!  How was your wine tour?  I thought about you guys.  It looked like so much fun!  Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!)  I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.  Let me know what you think!!  And I hope all is going well for you!  Kim 
 El, I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details! Thanks for the invite -  K. 
 I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules! 
 Gerald & Stacy,  I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.  ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.  I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.  Thanks,  Kim 
 el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?  Kim 
 We can come in on Thursday evening (so we can spend friday in the wine country) and leave sunday afternoon at 3:20 for 20000 miles!  So we are definitely in!  What do you think?

 Mara,  Could you break the attached volumes down to MMbtu/day for each facility as well as total per day?  thanks,  Kim 
 I threw most of mine away - now I will munch on chocolate all afternoon.  At least it tastes better! 
 I think I might show up - was going to work out here but it will be less crowded there.  See you there 
 Thanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -  Kim 
  Rob,  I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.  I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac!  Kim

 I will check on this - also, keep me posted on Conexant and let me know how you want to set it up.  We are busy getting moved onto the new floor.  Kim 
 also, who use to do the smurfit invoice and who is their boss - do you know? 
 Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not = much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a= change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think t= hat there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that par= t.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice. = Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suza= nne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with C= orporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay o= n with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this w= ay, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES= gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Than= ksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip= - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse = to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out wi= th myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?= I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the ho= liday season and time for (good) cheer!  Kim 
 are you talking about JS?  thought she was going to kentucky?  I was going with my friend Elizabeth but she is probobly going to have to work on Friday.  So I may just ride back with her.  Trying to figure it  all out. 
 As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Let's meet today at 3:00 in conference room 6106 to discuss the griffth deal and our reply to citizens.  If you are unable to make it, please let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
  $3.18 plus origination 
 Jim,  Just wondering if you had that list of counselors or if you were interested in setting something up.  Kim 
 Jim,  Attached is Enron's response to your Request for Natural Gas Supply Proposals.    If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 713-853-0685.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Sean,  I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is "assuring me" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.  Thanks,  Kim 
 ok - I am here 
 I'm off my call 
 Terri,  What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.  Let's get together for a beer soon -  Kim 
 Suz,  I say lets do it! and so does Terri.  I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.  I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!  Keep me posted on how your day is going.  I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.  K. 
 Kam,  Thanks so much for your help!  Kim 
 when can we meet today to discuss our written response to Citizens? 
 FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk. 
 Dan,  Just wanted to follow up with you to see how things ended up with your RFP.  I would really like to be the natural gas supplier to your plants in California.  Please call me at your earliest convenience - 713-853-0685.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Brent,  Attached is the confirmation for serving Smurfit's plants in southern California for December 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!  Thanks,  Kim  Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful. 
 if you are on continental, are you flying into IAH?  Maybe that is what I should do and we could take one cab.  what do you think? 
  in the case that you want to call him!  Kim

 Stacy,  I just talked to Palo alto.  They would like to schedule a conference call for tomarrow, noon our time.  I told them it would be up to you.  Please let me know if this gives you enough time.  Thanks,  Kim Ward x30685
