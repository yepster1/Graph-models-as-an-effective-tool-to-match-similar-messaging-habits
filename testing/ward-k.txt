 Lyndon,  I finally got my CDs back yesterday and I was so happy!  Thanks again for making sure that they were sent to Miami.  How are you?  Where are you?  where have you been?  Since I have to sit in this office everyday staring at a computer screen, I must live vicariously through people like you!  I'm actually not traveling until mid september.  I go to Denver on sept. 8 - 10 and then to Southern California the following week.  October brings Arizona, Aruba, and perhaps northern california.  Looking forward to Aruba - don't really care about the rest since they are work!!  Anyway - hope all is well with you and that you are enjoying yourself - wherever you might be!  Take care,  K2

 No, we need to change the price to be confirmed at a weighted average price of $3.90.  I put this on  the deal sheet.  Don't know if they noted it in the system.  Please change and let me review again.  Thanks,  kIm 
 Stacy,  I just extended a deal with the City of Pasadena for September.  The previous deal was for April thru August and the confirm was prepared by Dan Hyvl.

 J.  Barry wants to know the credit status post the financial info I gave you yesterday.  he is meeting with Mark Baldwin on Thursday and wants to prepare.  K. 
 Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.  kw 
 Willis,  I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Jan, too, says that smurfit is not running the cogen and that they don't expect to for quite some time.  I asked her to let me know if they do decide to start the turbine.  Will keep you informed -  Kim 
 J. & Stacy,  Barry would like to set up a meeting to discuss CDWR from both a Credit and Legal standpoint before he goes to see them on Thursday.  Please let me know when you are available and I will set up the meeting.  Thanks,  Kim

 This is all of the info that I have on these customers but I may be able to get more if it is valuable to you.  just let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  These are some examples of the blend and extend deals that we discussed earlier.  Like I said, these are just some examples that we came up with but we can look at different terms and volumes for each of them.  Let me know if you have questions and we can go over this any time.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Craig,  I agree with Charlie.  I wasn't here until January so I was not aware of the Dec. 28 deal.  I think that when we do August, my information should be complete.  Sorry for all of the inconveniences.  Thanks for your help.  Kim  p.s.  I will tell Darla. 
 Once again, I didn't have all information and shared with you an incomplete package for july!  Attached is a spreadsheet with the missing peices.  I promise, we will get this procedure in place once and for all!  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Going to Scottsdale Wednesday night for a little sun, spa, and relaxation!   Have fun in Houston - 
 Darla,  I made a few changes to this spreadsheet.  Please discard the other one that you have.  Thanks,  Kim

 Ellen,  Attached is the confirmation for sept. for the city of pasadena prepared by legal.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hi Steve,  Just wanted to update the status with the ISDA.  I believe that you have received a copy of the new draft with all of the changes that we've agreed to.  If you guys approve of this draft, we can have an executable copy drawn up and sent to you.  As for the outside council opinion, Sara Shackleton is out of the office until next tuesday and her assistant doesn't know how to proceed with this process.  We will have to wait for Sara's return in order to facilitate that process.  I have sent her an email so that we can get started right away.  Let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or if you have any questions.  I do hope you are able to enjoy the long weekend!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sara,  Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks for your help,  Kim 
 Lou,  Our price indications for PG&E City Gate delivery for 18 and 21 mos out of October, 2001 are $3.78.  For the term June, 2003 through July 2006, it is $3.97.   Please call me if you have any questions or need additional pricing.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination

 Hi guys,  Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.  I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Let me know when you find out.  Have a good day!  K. 
  j., attached are contracts that I was discussing with you this morning.  If we were to attempt to transact with these counterparties, short term or long term,  what were we need to have in place to do so?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Stacy,  I left you a message but wanted to send you a note too.  I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?  Let me know how things look for you as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Kim

 PG&E City Gate is the delivery point and lets start out with $.05. 
 Jason,  I need your help on 2 EASY things -  1)  I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.  United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.  What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?  And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.  2)  THIS IS REAL DEAL:  Merced Irrigation District.  They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.  I gave them an indication of $3.85.  I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.  Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?  They were concerned about what credit would require.  Please let me know as soon as possible!  I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Sure!!  Jeff at Merced said to tell you not to stay late!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 Stacy,  This looks good to me.  Are there any of these issues that we would be flexible on?  Thanks for your help,  Kim 
  this is a copy of the letter legal is planning to send to Hesco regarding L-T contract recommendations.  They have a copy of master enfolio agreement.  Any comments?  Kim 
 Eric,  Attached is a spreadsheet with the price indications you asked for.  I hope it is helpful.  Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Thanks,  Kim 
 I just got your documents.  Call me. 
 No problem - left a message for Steve Lins but never heard from him.  Will probobly send him an email today.  Thanks,  Kim 
 We are going to get thsi Merced deal done! 
 Are you going to send the letter our or email it or do I need to do anything?  thanks for your help,  Kim 
 Call or come by when you get a chance - I have a question on the blend & extend  Thanks,  Kim 
 Go to www. unitedcogen.com 
 Steve,  It appears as though the outside council opinion is no longer keeping us from completing the ISDA.  If you guys are ok with the current language, we can send you an executable copy and you guys can sign and send back with all of the documents that are required according to the ISDA.  We are prepared to provide you with our documents and will send them with the executable copies of the ISDA.  Call me when you get a chance and let me know what your status is.  I think Barry and I will be in So. California the 17th and 18th.  If you have some time, we would like to stop by and see you guys.  Just let me know when you are available.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Gentlemen,  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Mike,  I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.  It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.  (I will be out Monday)  Have a great weekend!  I hope this is helpful.  Kim 
 Sara,  I am in Denver at an offsite but will be back in the office tomarrow.  Glendale left me a message on Friday that they are ready for an executable ISDA agreement.  I left you a message earlier but wanted to make sure you got it.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  My cell phone number is 713-412-4571.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Mark,  The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.  Thanks for your inquiry -  Kim Ward 
 Hey,  did you call me this morning?  Sorry I missed it if you did.  Been running around like crazy - currently missing presentations trying to close a small (very!) deal.  If I don't talk to you, good luck with your pitch to your customer!  I hope you get the deal!  Talk to you later,  Kim 
 They keep calling.  What do we need to do right now to do the Amgen blend and extend, either paper work or additional collateral?  Let me know soon.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Hello everyone,  I got an email yesterday from Jack confirming our meeting on Monday at 2 p.m.  In light of the recent tragic events and the chaotic state that the commercial airline industry is in, Barry and I will not be traveling to California next week.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  We do plan to come out to California to see you guys at a later date.  Once things have settled down and we are able to re-schedule, we will be in touch.  Steve, I am working with Legal to have executable documents sent to you and will keep you posted.  Thanks again for your patience.  Please call me if any of you need anything or have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Just got my fourth phone call this morning - what do we need to do to blend amgen?  Kim 
 Jack,  I have been unable to get this message to Larry.  Would you make sure he gets it for me?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Marie,  Please fax the ISDA documents to Steve Lins, city attorney, city of glendale, fax # 818-547-3402.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 I am sure that Ann took care of this last week because some confirms were generated that came across my desk.  Let me know if there is anything I can do.  Thanks, Kim 
 Stephanie and I talked about this as well - I think lunch today would be a good send off and a wedding gift on his return would be in order. 
 Sara,  I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim

 Hey Lyndon!  Very glad to finally hear from you.  Sounds like you are happy= back in Austrailia!  I would love to see it sometime.  Unless things chang= e between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on Janu= ary 6th.  We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. Ma= rtin look fabulous.  We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before w= e get on the boat.  I hope you are there.  Although I would understand if y= ou stayed where you are!  Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay i= n Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.  As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really clo= se to me was killed.  I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night, just = in time not to get stuck there.  One of my very good friends was suppose to= be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was ca= lled back to Houston for a meeting tuesday.  Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 = am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had= that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him= .  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is ve= ry sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are= doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make = me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that th= is thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most = things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freed= om were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in= and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be d= one to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away = to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that a= ttitude! =20  Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing th= e same - just here in ugly Houston for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba = for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of= the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go= back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!  Take care,  Love, K2  ps.  I have another email address at home.  It is kward1@houston.rr.com

 Jay,  We have been short listed on an rfp for Noresco, a power plant developer.  Attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project.  They plan to refresh prices and perhaps transact this week.  they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.  I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.  I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.  It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.  CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??  PLEASE?  I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!)  Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!  thanks,  Kim 
 The weekend was VERY good!  But - the weekend is the past.  Who knows what the future brings!   Even so - in your searching, you might find someone better than me!  But, if I am still unattached, I will be there!  K. 
 Call me if you have any questions.  Kim  THANKS!!!!]] 
 Chris,  The package you sent me was delayed due to weather - I should get it in am. 
 Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -  K. 
 That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.  K.  ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!
