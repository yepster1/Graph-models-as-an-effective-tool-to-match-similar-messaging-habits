   ----- Original Message ----- Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!    Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults.  What do most people do on a date?  Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.  --Lynette, age 8  On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10  What would you do if a date was not working  out?  I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age  When is it okay to kiss someone?  When they're rich. --Pam,age 7  The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that. --Curt, age  The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8  How would the world be different if people weren't  married?  There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8  What is the right age to get married?  No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6  Is it better to be single or married?  It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them. --Anita, age 9  I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8  How do you decide who to marry?  You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10  No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10  How can a stranger tell if two people are  married?  You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8  What do your mom and dad have in  common?  Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age  How would you make a marriage work?  Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10 
 Chris,  When you get a chance, I have a couple of questions about this term sheet.  i.e., 8:00 vs 8:30. 
 E.  Make sure the reservations are for the ocean blvd. patio side. ( not the patio in the back)  I hope this is not too much trouble.  We want to sit with the rock stars!!  Thanks,  Kim

 Because  I had an updated curve for PG&E and not for Malin.  I asked the Malin trader - he hadn't updated his curves but the other guy had.   I am going to start asking so that I am consistant.  Let me know what you want to do and I will show you transactional numbers.  Thanks for letting me know.  Kim

 I am one of the houston people - myself and 5 of my friends.  Moved back in January. 
 That price indication does reflect the time value of money - so - if bought - power in 2001 would be billed at $61/MWh.  Kim 
 Arnold,  I must have been looking at the wrong index or report.  I have now gotten access to Natural Gas Intelligent's web-site so I can give very fast and accurate prices.  I am sorry for the confusion and hope that I didn't cause a lot of trouble.  Just so you know, april was $12.56 plus the $.05 premium.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kimi 
 No.  Have you talked to her?  I have been busy - my usual excuse.  I went to Scottsdale last weekend.  It was great!  What have you been up to?  K. 
 Hello everyone,  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all fixed price deals that I have done with Pasadena as well as my term sheet for February and March.  I am working with Patti and Anne Bike to make sure things are in the system as best they can be.  Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be glad to help you as much as I can.  I am out of the office until Monday.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Are you the proud owner of a new house now?  When do you move in?

 I found a good place - Bay Area Sailing.  When you have time, go to their website - www.bayareasailing.com and let me know what you think. 
 I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.  Thanks for your help!  Kim 
 Hey Doug,  How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway, can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when I get back.  Have a great weekend,  Kim Ward 
 Call my co-worker, Phil Polsky @ 713-853-5181.  He will be ready to help you out with whatever you need.  If he can do this today - it would be good.  Thanks,  Kim

 would you think I was crazy if I told you I thought we were going to sell three years of gas to knauf?? 
          Dan:  To help your prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.  PG&E Large Packages Index Trends  1.   PG&E Large Packages is the interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern into PG&E.  The interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern and Kern into SoCal is referred to as SoCal Border.  2.   PG&E gas supply comes in from three main pipelines:  PGT (Canada), El Paso/Transwestern (San Juan and Permian) and Kern River (Rockies).  With the exception of a few very cold days in Canada and the Northwest, the cheapest supply comes from Canada.  The other two pipes are similarly priced, based on the incremental cost of gas out of the Southwest and what options the supply has.  There is always some marginal demand for supply out of the Southwest into PG&E, but it can be a small number of only about 500,000 MMBtu/d in a shoulder month and 1,000,000 MMBtu on a peak day.  When it is a low demand day PG&E large packages will trade like Malin (PGT interconnect to PG&E).  On a peak day PG&E large packages trades like SoCal border.  3.  Effective April 1, El Paso changed the way gas moves on their system.  It used that anyone with primary delivery point capacity to PG&E could deliver into SoCal on a primary basis.  Now, if you have PG&E primary, you can only get into SoCal on an alternate delivery point basis.  Because capacity is constrained, PG&E primary capacity will generally not flow into SoCal.  Thisis why PG&E Large Packages trades at a discount to SoCal Border.  4.  PG&E large packages is the relevant index for the PP&L deal:  PG&E trades at a significant discount to SoCal because of the reasons listed above.    Anyone with primary SoCal delivery will want to go into SoCal.  This leaves the PG&E capacity as the marginal capacity that folks could use for delivery to Griffith.  If anyone owns primary delivery into SoCal they will use it there.  Citizens is offering Griffith a discount relative to these suppliers.  The good news is that PG&E delivery is still very strong because given the gas supply balance in California the marginal supply out of the southwest is needed.  5.  PG&E large packages is becoming more liquid:  Now that El Paso has changed the way gas moves on their pipeline there is a much more distinct difference between the types of capacity on El Paso.  Folks that own capacity want ways to hedge its value.  Enron has recognized this and plans to introduce the PG&E large packages point on Enron Online, our internet based trading system.  Trading volume at the PG&E point has increased in the last month and is expected to continue to increase.  This is good for Citizens as the liquidity makes the index more reflective of the market.  It also reduces the risk that the index doesn't print as has often occurred in the past.  (See historical data attached).  It also reduces the spread between the bid and offer at that point.  6.  PG&E Large Packages has gotten much stronger:  it used to be that the San Juan/SoCal Border spreads barely covered variable transport expense.  Now the demand is much stronger in CA and the transportation value has increased.   California is short storage due to growth in demand with the new power plants and the strong economy.  Although demand due to the economy is likely to fall, the new power plants and short storage position still create a very bullish situation.  For example, current valuations for the PG&E index are in the attached spreadsheet below:
