ork for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!  How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -  Kim 
 Gerald,  Thanks for looking at this for us.  When do you think you will have a chance to review it?  I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.  Also, do we need to have credit re-review?  Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.  Thanks,  Kim 
 MJ,  How are you doing?  Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!  How was your wine tour?  I thought about you guys.  It looked like so much fun!  Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!)  I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.  Let me know what you think!!  And I hope all is going well for you!  Kim 
 El, I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details! Thanks for the invite -  K. 
 I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules! 
 Gerald & Stacy,  I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.  ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.  I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.  Thanks,  Kim 
 el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?  Kim 
 We can come in on Thursday evening (so we can spend friday in the wine country) and leave sunday afternoon at 3:20 for 20000 miles!  So we are definitely in!  What do you think?

 I threw most of mine away - now I will munch on chocolate all afternoon.  At least it tastes better!

 Thanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -  Kim 
  Rob,  I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.

 also, who use to do the smurfit invoice and who is their boss - do you know? 
 Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not = much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a= change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think t= hat there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that par= t.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice. = Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suza= nne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with C= orporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay o= n with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this w= ay, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES= gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Than= ksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip= - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse = to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out wi= th myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?= I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the ho= liday season and time for (good) cheer!  Kim 
 are you talking about JS?  thought she was going to kentucky?  I was going with my friend Elizabeth but she is probobly going to have to work on Friday.  So I may just ride back with her.  Trying to figure it  all out. 
 As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Let's meet today at 3:00 in conference room 6106 to discuss the griffth deal and our reply to citizens.  If you are unable to make it, please let me know.  Thanks,  Kim 
  $3.18 plus origination 
 Jim,  Just wondering if you had that list of counselors or if you were interested in setting something up.  Kim 
 Jim,  Attached is Enron's response to your Request for Natural Gas Supply Proposals.    If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 713-853-0685.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 
 Sean,  I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is "assuring me" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.  Thanks,  Kim 
 ok - I am here 
 I'm off my call 
 Terri,  What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.  Let's get together for a beer soon -  Kim 
 Suz,  I say lets do it! and so does Terri.  I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.  I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!  Keep me posted on how your day is going.  I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.  K. 
 Kam,  Thanks so much for your help!  Kim 
 when can we meet today to discuss our written response to Citizens? 
 FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk. 
 Dan,  Just wanted to follow up with you to see how things ended up with your RFP.  I would really like to be the natural gas supplier to your plants in California.  Please call me at your earliest convenience - 713-853-0685.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination

 Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!  Thanks,  Kim  Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful.

  in the case that you want to call him!  Kim
