 quick reminder. The cell phones are for group member to group member usage.  As such, calling between group members, and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free.  We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters.  Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month.  Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month!    Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used.  If you want to use this phone as your only phone, let me know, and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you.  Thank you, B 
 Leslie, This looks good to me.  Thanks for the update. Bill 
 Group,  STWBOM is short tomorrow (07/31/01) on Peak in SP-15.  We are short 25 mws at $51.74.  STCALI is short 4 mws(?) on peak in SP-15 at $51.74. ST-CALI is long 24 mws off peak at a price of $25.  If you have questions, just let me know.  Thanks, Bill 
 These look good from my end.  Thank you for the update. Bill 
 Sweet.  Just grab me after lunch sometime I spose...if that works for you. 
 We can meet.  Who else do we need?  Anyone? 
 I would like to get this process going as quickly as possible. Interviews on Thursday? Thanks, Bill 
 Good morning. Hope your new year is off to a great start! 
 Thank you Kate. 
 That sounds good to me. I appreciate your help. Bill 
 Group,  I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner.  Dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.  These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.  If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know. Dave Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.  Dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out). I feel this goes without saying but maybe...  Thanks for your help with this.  Bill 
 I think you know. 
 Dave, Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. First, regarding handsets.  Each real-time desk needs 2 handsets.  Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well. Also, I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret, and on each RT turret as well.  Also on Stewart Rosman's, Greg Wolf's, Les Rawson's and Chris Foster's.  I also need Kate Symes extension displayed on my turret (this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets). Her TRID is #106 ext. 3939, my TRID is #140 ext. 3730. I will address our treatment of handsets with the group. Feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4PM for a meeting if you still have time. Thanks for the help. Bill 
 Easy there Gentleman 
 Group,  I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today.  Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.  Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.  I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday.  Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.  Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.  I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.  Therefore:  We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.  Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.  Les has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me.  If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.  And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work.  This service is a priority and should be treated as such.  Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.  Thanks, Bill 
 Last time I checked, no one could tell the difference. B 
 Steve, Great email! Arbitrary and capricious indeed. More like ridiculous. 
 **Per Tony at EPE, the following is new for 2002. I will attempt to get more information and pass it on as I receive it.**  First, TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE.  The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP. Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale.  Second, SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load, SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the Eddy tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC. Again, this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO.  **The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo. 25 is firm just like the last two years, 50 is econ. and can be varied by PNM each hour.**  Please ask if you have any questions.  Thanks, Bill 
 Gentlemen,  After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We have purchased 50 mws from LV Cogen for HE 8, HE 9 and HE 10 at $35.  We will need to buy transmission from NEVP from Nevada system to Mead 230 and then into the CAISO for HE 8 thru HE 10.  This energy can go towards the ST-CALI and ST-WBOM short in SP-15. I will do enpower for these deals when I arrive in the morning. Remember to give NEVP 2 hours of notice-maybe even 2 and a half...Please call me with any questions.  Thanks, Bill 
 Are you kidding me?  This is absurd. 
 Group,  We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.  25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.  We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.  25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.  Both schedules are HE 7-22.  All deals should be under appropriate books.  Please take extra time with the EPE lending.  We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.  Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.  Thanks, Bill 
 Heather, On the new deal summary for 07/23/01, I changed the El Paso Electric deal #697528 price from $4 to $68. I should not receive the $25524.54 as revenue shown in the new deal summary.  Is there any way to recalculate this (or simply zero it out) prior to the morning flash? Let me know what I can do to help. Thanks, Bill 
 Kate, I think we need to enter the buy from EPE flat to our day ahead sale to STSW.  Otherwise the new deal sheet shows revenue that we did no receive. B 
 Sounds good. B 
 Group,  I have attached the following cut procedures that should be of benefit as we move into fire season.  The sheet is very basic but spells out my expectations for handling a cut.  The most important thing to remember is to document everything and call with questions.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report. Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks, Bill 
  Baruuuh? 
 Great. Thanks, B 
 Cara, We are short 14 mws at the Portland General System in position manager for Friday, July 20th.  HE 5 and HE 6.  Pacificorp deal #694155 is not in for those hours. Could you look into this? Thanks, Bill 
 Kate, EPE will be lending us a schedule for Tuesday, 25 mws at $4 at PV. The schedule will be on peak.  Similar to today.  Please work with the preschedulers to get the sheet correct (Friday's sheet for Monday had a duplicate 10 mw schedule in it). Let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Bill 
 Apparently not. The EPE preschedule sheet had a 25 mw lending position in... We'll have to work with the preschedulers to get it squared away.  B 
 Kate, We need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role.  Please take some time over the weekend to consider what might be helpful for the desk (ie. collecting pertinent weather information, transmission derates, day-ahead prices, congestion, historical spreads, etc.) and let me know on Monday or Tuesday what we can do.  Take your time but have a good weekend.  Bill 
 Tim, Per our conversation on Friday regarding the WBOM book, I will limit spreads to 50 with a net of 25 open.  If you have any questions or have further feedback, just let me know. Thanks, Bill 
 After a year in RT...yeah, you could do it... 
 Will do. Thanks B 
 If this works for you, please copy and paste it into your own email and send it on. Thanks- B  Group,  We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).  Thanks, Bill 
 Greg,  I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position i= n August.  I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell = PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-tim= e market throughout August.  NP and SP are currently trading near flat.  I = think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximat= ely $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California make= s this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have d= iscussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso. While I recognize the re= st of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidati= ng in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dai= lies because of the current price levels.  This also represents a relativel= y low risk trade (under $10 downside).  I also would like to use these posi= tions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.  If you have concerns or qu= estions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over th= e next week.  Thanks, Bill 
 I don't know, where you planning on going?  If you are, I may not. It depends what is on the agenda. B 
 Kourtney, Just a quick heads up for the flash. Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks, Bill 
 Kate, I will not have time today.  Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow. Thanks, Bill 
 Amy, I added a sentence describing the potential for this position to be temporary. Please see me with any questions.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We will be taking over the dispatch of Enron Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 (beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day, except July 20, where the start time will be 15:00 PDT).  Here is a note of things to remember:  ?	SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT.  The plant will call with updates periodically.  Please record this information in the dispatch log.  This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site.  Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log. The fundamentals site can be found at  http://albertapower/xnav/default.htm  ?	SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5.  That's 353MW @ $5.  Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down.  ?	ECC's  telephone line (403-974-6900) has been forwarded to your line for the required hours.  You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line.  ?	The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403.  You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed.  This most likely won't happen.  In case it does, the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca.   [You must Login (top right hand corner) as John A. Zufferli-this MUST be done on my computer.  Click on ETS, then Submission.] - our passwords are not currently working...so... you can call the Alberta powerpool for help. You can then restate the offers of SD3 and SD4 as required. Unless something changes you will need to fax the resubmission to Alberta Power Pool and have them resubmit it.  ?	If you have any problems you can reach Bill Greenizan at 620-1180 or his pager at  billgreenizan@epagenet.net.  PLEASE CALL ME WITH QUESTIONS! Thanks,  Bill 
 I am available at any point this morning, including now. B 
 Virginia,  I spoke with Mike Swerzbin and Mike Driscoll this morning regarding an annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW to compensate LT-NW for energy at Montana that was not sold on June 4th.  ST-Whourly will pay LT-NW our average hourly price per mw for that energy.  That price is $23 per mw.  Please revise the annuity as appropriate. If you have any questions, please come see myself or Mike.  Thank you,  Bill 
 Group, Please continue our policy of NOT buying energy from or selling energy to the California Imbalance.  I do not feel comfortable with the many risks associated with these transactions at this time (financial, physical, legal, political).  Please see me on an individual basis with questions or discussion regarding this.  Thanks, Bill 
 Good morning, Hope you had a great holiday!  Bill 
 Kate, We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday.  We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89.  This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947.  We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday.  If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash, otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time.  Thanks for the help.  Bill 
 Kate, Good morning, hope you had a good weekend. I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.  The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS. Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.  You may want to walk over and "remind" them of this.  I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.  Hopefully everything will work.  If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell. John Anderson will be in at 8.  Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group,  We are long on Sunday.  15 mws for HE 12-20 at NP15 in PGE3 at $25.  I made the deals as DA schedules in CAPS.  I have made the purchase from the APX and the sale to imbalance (#685979, #685978).  We are long on Monday.  Shaped schedule.  Price of $35.  HE 10:	35 HE 11:	30 HE 12:	25 HE 13-17: 15 HE 18: 10 HE 19-21: 15  I have made the purchase from APX and the sale to the imbalance in Enpower (#685980,685981). Schedules are in CAPS under ST-WBOM.  Templates have been submitted Day ahead.  Please make real-time purchases from the Calimbalance and corresponding sales under ST-WBOM in Enpower during real time.  Please call me with questions. 503-887-3449  Thanks, Bill 
 Group,  I will be out of the office visiting CDWR, SMUD and NCPA on Monday through Wednesday.  I should be back Wednesday afternoon.  You can reach me on my cell phone if you need.  Thanks, Bill 
 I am working on getting Nate's email. I will try to get him to show up at indoor on Monday. B 
 Group, A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.  We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.  PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.  My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.   Then nothing happens.  There are two things we need to do to prevent this.  One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.  Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.  Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.  Hopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.  Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses  Bill 
 Green Room,  Granted, I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list, I also favor the move to D1.  I think better competition will be more fun, provided that we field a full team (speaking mostly at myself here) on a consistent basis.  I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the Fall season, I also know another player-Nate Stanton (he has played with a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker and better than myself.  So for what it's worth.  D1 all the way.  Thanks.  B 
 Kate,  This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.  I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.  We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.  I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.  Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.  Boring, but important.  B 
 Kristie,  Hello. How are you? What are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. It has been a while to say the least, but the other day Brendan and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough). I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.  Brendan said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.  I hope you don't mind.  Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.  I began trading power about a year and a half ago for Enron.  I now manage the  west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San Francisco, right?)...  My job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Art Museum.  The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.  It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.  It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.  The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.  The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.  So, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.  Take care.  Bill 
 John, Here are the remaining hourly traders.  Bill Williams Ryan Slinger Holden Salisbury Geir Solberg Bert Meyers Craig Dean Casey Anderson Mike Mier  Let me know if you need anything else...  Bill 
 Check this out...you should read Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis, and Den of Thieves. Good stuff.   He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch Is Enron the New Drexel? By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.'' Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. Alumni Will Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. (This is something I still don't understand, and would lov
