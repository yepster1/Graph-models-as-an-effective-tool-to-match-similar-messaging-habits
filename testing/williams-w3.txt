 I will be out of the office visiting El Paso Electric and PNM through Friday evening. Please see Ryan with any questions regarding trading. I can be reached on my cell phone at 503-887-3449. Thanks,  Bill 
 What? Is receiving an email at 1:30 too late? Just because everything is done by 10...At least NW is on the right side of the market...oh wait...their not...doh! And looks like today was a bad day to go short...but who's counting? 
 Todd, From an information standpoint this looks good. I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts. You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron. The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have. If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.  Thanks, Bill 
 Amy,  I am interested in either position...as I imagine each person in the real-time group will be. Let me know if I can be of help with anything.  Thanks, Bill 
 Grace, Could you sign me up for the bus pass. I am selling my car and no longer need the parking. Thanks, Bill 
 That's right, I forgot about QOTSA.  Did you enjoy that CD? Your dad is coming in today to see the trading floor and then we are going to grab some lunch and talk about what we do here at the big E. I fly out at 4 on Friday afternoon...  I guess Nikki is coming to Portland at the end of October...oh-oh.  b 
 B- I will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you. Maybe an early afternoon brew... Emily Willis--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat tire. 
 Bert, I put all the names in a hat...and you are the man...please revise the schedule and redistribute it with yourself attending the trip... Enjoy!

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you for the help.  Bill

 Group, Here is some more inforation regarding taking care of Canada this weekend. Bill 
 Yes...sorry about implying that you did not have approval... 
 Paul, Thanks for the invitation but I will not be able to attend on Friday.  Bill 
 Darren, Just let me know when you have time and we will set it up. B 
 This is relatively irrelavent but thought you might enjoy it...of course...it is made up...just like everything else forwarded on the internet none of these people actually exist... 
 Of course you were. Don't feel bad though, we all get confused at times. Some of us just more than others.

 Group, We will be covering for Enron Canada Corp as stated below. All submissions will have to be faxed to the Power Pool as we do not have a working digital certificate. Call me with any questions. Thanks, Bill 
 Here is the original email from Keoni, and the follow-up from Chris Foster. Just give me a call with any questions.  Thanks,  Bill 
 Group, When tiering adjustment bids, the CAISO system will not read more than 10 bids. Also, remember to have the tier monotically increasing. Thanks, Bill 
 What do you guys think? 
 Group, There is a new schedule out for October. Please take a look at it. If you need to switch days, feel free. Please send Bert and I an email notifying us of the changes and be sure to write your changes on the schedule. Schedule changes need to be communicated for obvious reasons.  Thanks, Bill 
 And here is the attachment  Bill 
 Group,  Please take a look at the following attachment. It details how we will be entering our Enpower and CAPS 99% of the time. If you have any questions, just let me know.  Thanks,  Bill 
 ate, You should recieve an email from Sean Crandall detailing a short position for tomorrow (Saturday) and for Monday. Please give this information to the group including Enpower information...etc.  Call me if you have any questions. Thanks, Bill 
 Cindy,  Please...remove me from your list. I am not involved with security, in Houston or otherwise, and can not help you obtain a security badge.  Bill 
 Dave,  I have attached a revised budget forecast for 2002. The 2002 headcount  (column D) is now correct at the top of the budget. I do not have a number from David Steiner yet regarding technology costs (row 107) but I am expecting it soon. Everything else is pretty much as you and I discussed earlier today. Please call me with any questions. Thank you for the help.  Bill 
 Cindy,  Please remove my name from whatever list you might have. I work in Portland and am not involved with security clearance or security access.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, Please remember to put the Tag # in the inc sheet. Every schedule should now be tagged if it is outside of the CAISO. Please get the tag # from our counterparties to put in the inc sheet. This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes. Include a comment in the Tag # section if there is no tag.  Thanks, Bill 
 Jill, Ryan Slinger previously had a plan set up. It looks like our AT&T rep switched him back to the group calling plan. Please check with Ryan and he will let you know what he needs. Thanks, Bill 
 Jill, I was being sarcastic about the $16000. Could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 3 months (AT&T should have this info). If you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well. I am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent. I appreciate the help.  Thanks, Bill 
 Absolutely, Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month. Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need (I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs).  Let's put this in effect by October. I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges (and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290--have we really spent $16000 on new phones? Thanks, Bill 
 Jill, Could you also cancel my monthly PalmNet service. Thanks, Bill 
 Jill,  I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.  Thanks, Bill 
 The BMW is of course a 1992! Priced at only $9900!!! How could you not buy it. 
 Group,  We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.  Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.   IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01 $49	$49	$74	99	149	174	199	249	249   EXPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01 $0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1   *NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE*  Please see me with any questions before imp
