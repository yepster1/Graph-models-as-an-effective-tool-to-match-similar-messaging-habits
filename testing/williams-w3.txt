en it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).  Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).  An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).  Other ideas?  So I am in the new place.  It's great!  Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).  Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.  Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table...  B 
 John, Thanks for the timely note.  PRC is today. Much appreciated. B 
 Sean,  Just to follow-up from yesterday. Two key real-time customers would be MPC (load balancing agreement) and EPE (power "consulting" agreement). Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important, but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two. As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company (and likely before), I think we need to visit these customers and get them back.  Ideas?  Bill 
 Group, We will be meeting on Thursday at 4:30 to discuss recent changes and the company outlook with Tim on Thursday Dec. 13th at 4:30. Please call me if you cannot make it. Thanks,  Bill 
 Thank you. 
 Bam. Let me know what you hear 
 Sorry to hear it man. It has not been a great last couple of months. 
 What up dawg! How are you and Meg doing? I still have a job. It has been an extremely rocky time. However, I feel optimistic that our trading business will continue in some fashion. I believe that we will be bought out by an investment bank and that we will be able to start trading again. The chances are good that I will have to thin out my group a bit, I am hoping that attrition will take care of some of the members of the group. I think we are going to let traders out of their contract if they want to leave. Hopefully that will cut down on any direct lay-offs I will have to do. It would suck having to lay-off good people. Its worrisome but like I said, I am optimistic. Soccer was going well, but I sprained my knee pretty badly playing indoor last night, so another two-three weeks before I am out there playing again...bollocks! Its ridiculous. How are things with you? I have two tickets to Mark Lanegan on December 19th at Berbatis Pan.  Are you going to be in town at that point? Its gonna be sweet. Still enjoying the Audi. My address is 1005 SW Park Ave. #706, Portland OR, 97205. Give me a ring and let me know what the word is. 503-887-3449.  Later, Bill 
 This can also be found at P:Realtime/Williamsonly/Dopewars in the P drive. If you have access. 
  The key is to go long Heroin and Coke when you have a chance. And put extra money in the bank  Bill 
 Group-  As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique. (YES!)  1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as "confirmed" (this will allow us to sort for cut or "confirmed" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.  2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING. On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).  IF you have any questions, please call me. We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.  Thanks,  Bill 
 For all cuts the following procedures apply...  1.) Notes as usual  2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).  3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just "bow out" gracefully if you have no other options with the words "L - D's."  4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.  Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.  This will probably not be a fun weekend. I appreciate your help.  Bill 
 This is important--- 
 Dave,  I need your help with some Enpower applications. Please give me a call as soon as you have an opportunity. By the way...I sure hope your Longhorns do NOT end up matched against my Huskies...ouch!  Thanks, Bill  1-800-684-1336 
 Group,  As of HE2 this morning, our contract with MPC was ended. For the time being, we will no longer be balancing MPC's load.  Also, we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission. Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws. But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest. These should be the only congestion wheels that we run.  Also, please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group,  Cuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below.  We will be handling cuts in the following manner:  1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.  2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.  3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).  4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position.  5. Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on Kate Symes' Desk.  I appreciate your help and diligence. Thanks,  Bill 
 Nope. 
 I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26. We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD. Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws. I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064. I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred. Please let me know if you have any questions. Bill 
  Theresa, Could you add DL-Portland Shift to this distribution. I would like the guys in Real-Time to be able to see this information when they come in. Thanks, Bill 
 I have also not been able to approve these. I do need those folks to have access... 
 Group-  We are currently owed money by CERS (approximately $100,000). We need to net this to a zero by Friday. It is very important that each of you call CERS and purchase energy from them to net this position out. Otherwise--we will see a loss of $100,000. Let's make this problem go away.  Thanks, Bill 
 Thanks for reserving the room. I will not need any food ordered. Thanks, Bill 
 Susan, Thank you. This looks good. To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal. Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded. Thanks, Bill 
 Allegheny's SC is now APX 5. Contact numbers are below.  Thanks Bill 
 Grace, What is a CPE certificate?  B 
 Kysa, Just wanted to give you a quick heads up. b 
 Group, Please put all information from the previous day (ie printed dispatch, EPE preschedulng sheet) into the appropriate folder on Kate Symes' old desk. Thanks, Bill 
 Good morning, I would like to obtain Global Trader ID's for the following traders on the Short Term West Hourly desk in Portland, Oregon. They will be using EnronOnline beginning next week, Nov. 26th.  Bert Meyers Mark Guzman Leaf Harasin Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean  Please call me with any questions. I can be reached at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449. Thank you for your help.  Bill Williams 
 I like that much better...super. 
 I appreciate the goals and accomplishments, I was looking more for a quick outline of duties. This should work though. Thanks, Bill 
 Tim,  I have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West. I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex. I am considering participating with Dow Jones. I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time. It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks. I am working with Kate and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index. I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to Steve Hall when they arrive. I have concerns that participating in this index may spread some of the value we obtain in making a market on EOL to our counterparties. I would appreciate your thoughts on this when you have an opportunity.  Thanks, Bill 
 Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path Confirmation  Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21.  NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login.  Following are a few pointers to help you get started.  1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under "Tools." 2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose "West" and click "Okay." 3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue. 4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule 5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the "Control" button and while selecting multiple rows. 6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute. 7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called "Cut Information" will come up. Select the "New Path Cut" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.) 8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.  Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.) 
 Group,  We will have an emergency meeting on Monday, November 26th at 4 PM. We will be going live on EOL for HE 7-22 on Monday. We will be discussing EOL trading, the new confirmation workspace in Enpower, business practice changes, and the Dynegy merger. Please make plans to attend. Contact me as soon as you can if you think you may not be able to make it.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below.  So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.  1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)  2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.  3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.  4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be: Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.  Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.  5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO.  a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners.  b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.  6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.  Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.  Thanks,  Bill 
 Jim, You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet. This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section. My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning. You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet. If you have any questions just let me know.  Thanks, Bill 
 Jim, We also received congestion revenue for HE 10 through HE 18. HE18-although it shows nothing from the CAISO on their site (their server went down) is the same as HE17-the CAISO specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line. Thanks, Bill 
 Jill, Could you look into my concur expense login/password. I am at a class today and need to approve these expense reports in the system. However,I cannot access the system. I am not sure if this is related to our floor wide network problems or what. Also, we are a go for Edgefield. You and I just need to talk about the expense report.  Thanks,  Bill

 Amy, Hey! Great to hear from you! Hope you are doing well. But... What are you talking about? Who's on what side? And what are you trying to recall?  Bill 
 I know Jim. You guys are doing well.  Thanks, Bill 
 Extra ST-SW transmission can be viewed in the Available Transmission Sheet. B 
 Good afternoon. We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13. Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning. The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3. We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5. This cost us $7.50. We imported it from MEAD 230. We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. This is from Redding.  Finally, ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead. You can query by Enron Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased. If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased. We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning.  Thanks,  Bill 
 Of course.  Deez nuts. 
 Dude-- It was $5. My total bet for the game was $40. $5 to you, $20 to Porter, $15 to Mark Fisher.  Come on...don't try to run me over. The gloating has to be worth $5.  B
