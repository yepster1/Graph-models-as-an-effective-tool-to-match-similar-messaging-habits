 Mark: I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the following in connection with my leave that you have approved:  1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.  2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence. Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.   3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should know more after next Wednesday.   Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.  Carol

 Jeff: Here is the e-mail that I sent to David regarding the categories that we wanted to see with respect to the unsigned confirm list.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Susan: I have bolded the transfer language that you need to use in the PanCanadian LC.  Please bracket it.  Thanks. Carol 
 Susan: Here is the revised confirm. 
 Dave: I expect to receive from our counsel in Mexico a memo addressing all of the online issues that we have asked them to address in the next day or so as I spoke with them yesterday about this.  I will need to review the memo with them and Mark Taylor to make sure that all of the issues have been adequately addressed and to determine if any changes need to be made to the documents. From my conversations with them, there don't appear to be any major issues other than the fact that we cannot offer "securities" to Mexican counterparties and they will define in the memo what products would be considered securities, but I want to see waht they put down in writing before we make any conclusions.  I or Mark will keep you posted.  Carol    David Forster@ENRON 07/06/2000 03:59 PM 
 Mark: Per my voice mail Carol 
 Jaime: when are you planning on sending this out?  I'm checking with Mark on this but I thought that we would wait until we had seen our counsel's memo before we would issue a press release or send these letters out.  Is that the plan? Given the ramifications of a press release, I want Mark's input on what it says and when it should be sent out. Carol    Jaime Williams@ENRON 07/06/2000 04:01 PM 
 Jaime: Thanks.  I spoke with Mark and he confirmed that we should do nothing until we have received and reviewed the memo from our counsel which hopefully we will get shortly and Mark and I will get on it right away.  Per your voice mail message, if we could include something in the cover letter to address our counsel's concern, that would be great.

 Russell: Here is a summary of the ownership chain of Global Companies LLC:  1. Its members are Global Petroleum Corp. ("GPC"), YPF Distribution Company ("YPF") and Montello Oil Corporation ("Montello").  From what they sent to us, I could not tell the ownership percentages.  2. The affairs of Global are managed by a "Board of Governors" who are selected by the members.  Specifically, GPC and Montello collectively get to choose 3 board members and YPF gets to choose 3 board members.  I your credit worksheet, you had specified as a "MAC" trigger if YPF, SA fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.  Is this the same entity as YPF Distribution Company?  Do you want this as a MAC or as an Additional Event of Default or Termination Event?  Carol 
 Bill: Yes and I received a message from them saying that had received it and are reviewing it.  I will be in meetings today from 10:30 to 2:00 but otherwise available.

 Susan and Samantha: We are in the process of completing a quarter end project called Project Margaux and have completed the Raptor II project.  With respect to Project Margaux, please coordinate with Mark Evans in London to get closing sets of documents.   With respect to Raptor II, I will leav a message with Alicia Curry at V&E to send you the closing sets.  I will leave with you my closing binder on Raptor I.  Sara, It might not be a bad idea to meet with Brenda Funk in the next few weeks to get updated on all of the qaurter end delas.  Carol 
 David: Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the following issue came up:  If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Alicia: I'm assuming that I will be gone when the closing sets for raptor II are sent out.  Could you please send one set to Susan Bailey, a legal assistant in our group, so we have one for the swap files?  Susan's number is 853-4737. Thanks.

 Rod: I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on. They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2 from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need to run this by someone else please let me know.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Mr. Davis: Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 David: Thanks for sending this to me.  Since I will be hear through next Friday at the latest, I would ask that once this chart has been completed that you contact Mark Taylor to see who from our group will take this project over while I am out.  Thanks. Carol    David P Dupre 07/07/2000 02:27 PM

 Susan and Samantha: This is a file that apparently Shari worked on and Susan Flynn gave to me.  I have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which then should be ready to sign.  There are some Guaranty issues that I need to take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.  Carol 
 Tana: I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.  Carol

 Zulie: I am teaching a junior achievement course to a third grade class at my son's school.  I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something akin to a "goodie bag" that they give out to kids.  Would I be eligible for this?  I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to ask.  My extension is 33989. Carol 
 Pablo: Thanks.  We really need to finalize everything by mid-week as the online folks are planning their roll-out at the end of this week.

Thanks so much for lending it to us.  I'm hoping that we will have a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there is that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

 Tana: Here is where things stand on Engage:  1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000  2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the Engage Canada financial transactions.  I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.  Carol

 Tanya: When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in fact this Master will be assigned to New Power? Carol 
 Mark: Who should handle this?  Given my situation, I would prefer not to take this on and I have talked to Seth about my situation.  Please let me know what you think.  Would this be something that Lou Stoler would work on with our help? Carol

 Mark: I received a notice in the mail in connection with Columbia Energy Services Corporation's sale of its "Mass Markets" business to The New Power Company. The purpose of the notice was to inform us that effective July 31, 2000 Columbia would be assigning its interest in the January 30, 1998 ISDA Master Agreement that it has with ENA to New Power as well as all transactions under it.  Please call me if you have any questions about this.  I expect that we will receive shortly a formal consent agreement.

 Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder."

 Luke: Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:  1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.  2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.  3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign.  4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.  5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following:    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Luke.Mickum@EngageEnergy.com 07/10/2000 10:47 AM

(just kidding).    We have been getting alot of stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail. On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK? Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so. Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you have done.  Tell Ric I hope to see him at the club in a few weeks.

 Suzanne: Some of the 8 week sick pay will be paid at 100% (4 weeks I believe) and some at 90%.  Therefore, please enter my vacation time as vacation time so I get paid 100% and not 90%.  Thanks.  Call us if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Suzanne Adams 07/18/00 05:41 PM

 Tanya: We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions for you:  1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.  2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?  3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?  4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?   Carol

 Ana: I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.  How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August. Sue is Charles' godmother.  Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol    Ampmstc@aol.com 07/10/00 05:18 PM 
 Russell: Thanks for the update.  Please continue to keep Sara and i posted. Eventually, someone in the group will be assigned to handle and finalize this.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Russell Diamond 07/20/00 07:25 AM 
 Suzanne: Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to finish.  tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.  carol  ps - if anyone has some astros tickets for this weekend let me know as bill and arthur may want to go.    Suzanne Adams 07/20/00 10:36 AM 
 Rod: Thanks for the message.  We are trying to find a good pediatrician in our area.  Who did you use?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Rod Nelson 07/20/00 12:12 PM 
 Cindy: Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at falling asleep on his own.  How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.    Sue, How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.   Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and call or write me.  Love, Carol   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Sara: Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well. Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Sara Shackleton 07/21/00 11:56 AM 
 Tanya: I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to the "transfer" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee provides a satisfactory guaranty to us. Carol 
 Rod: Thanks for the info.  Our family doctor has recommended someone close by so we'll give him a try.  Hang in there on the moving details.  I know that things will settle down soon.  Things are great here.  Charles Eugene seems to be adjusting well and we are really enjoying him.  He'll be in his crib in a few weeks.  As for the swap group, yes they are thin but they appear to be hanging in there.  I spoke with Mark yesterday.  When I left, Sara was in London taking care of her mom who became very ill while ahe was over there. She is fine now and Sara is back but Mark pretty much had to handle things on his own for a few days.  He appears to have survived.  we just hired Susan Flynn's replacement so hopefully by the end of August the LA's will be back at full strength which will help out alot.  Take care and keep in touch.  You may be getting some e-mails from Mary Cook about some of my files which she has now inherited.

 Terry: Just wanted to let you know that our son, Charles Eugene, was born on July 12th.  He is absolutely beautiful and well worth the long wait and all of the time and effort that it took to have him.  After a prolonged stay in the hospital, we are both home now and doing really well.  I'm on cloud nine and I'm sure that all of this will hit me soon.  Hope you are doing well.  Take care.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Suzanne: There is a savings bond program that Enron sponsors for year 2000 newborns. Could you please find out what I need to do to apply for one.

 Suzanne: Please send this to Scott Sefton and call the Bracewell person and tell them that he is now in charge of this matter.  I haven't had anything to do with this file since I joined the swap group.  Thanks.  Everything is fine.  Still on a hectic schedule but getting a little more sleep.  We take the baby to the pediatrician on Thursday for his first checkup and I go for mine on Friday.  I've started walking again and some very, very slow jogging (don't tell Bill this).  I feel really good and everything seems to be healing okay.  I've actually cooked a few meals!  I will try to call you in the next day or two.  We've been taking the baby out on short trips in the afternoon just to get out of the house.

 Dan: Thanks for the e-mail.  Things are going very well.  The hospital stay was a little long but once we both got home things got much better.  I miss the work routine but I'm really enjoying my time with both Charles and Arthur, and of course Bill.  I hope to be up and around in a week or so.  my recovery has been slow and steady but except for a lack of sleep, I feel great.  Hope to be running soon.  I'll be up for a visit in a few weeks.

 Suzanne: Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift. Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.  Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.  I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it? I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet (which I know you will).  As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.  Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by for a visit.  Carol    Suzanne Adams 07/27/00 05:34 PM 
 Tana: This should be pretty straight forward.  The only remaining issue was they needed to put in an effective date for the assignment amendment that they wanted us to sign.
