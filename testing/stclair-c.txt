 Rod: These are the issues  taht we need to talk about before our call on Wednesday afternoon. Carol 
 Linda: Here is what Stacy requested. Carol 
 Sara: Per my voice mail. carol 
 Sara: I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it won't happen.  Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your house?  We were just going to limit it to the swap group.  Let me know what you think.  Carol 
 Russell: Since late 1998, we have been trying to put in place a Master between ENA and the above counterparty.  We currently have a Master dated July 1997 between ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:   No Credit Support Providers Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below $133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1 They want to defined the "control" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side Forms of collateral are cash and LC's Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them  Let me know what you think.  Carol 
 Bill: This looks fine to me. Carol 
 Stacy or Jeff: Could you please verify that Frank's answers to the physical questions are correct?  Thanks. acrol 
 Frank: I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same counterparty for ENA and ECC.  Carol 
 Rod: I found my file and here is where things stand:  1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at $100,000.  2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days after quarter end.  3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.  4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:  Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.  Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all proper income charges, including taxes on income.  Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products.  Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these definitions?  5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.  This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.  Carol 
 Russell: I will call you later.  Could you please e-mail to me the credit worksheet? Carol 
 Frank: Stacy Dickson has confirmed that your answers with repsect to "physical" are correct. Carol 
 Susan: Please send me a revised chart. Carol 
 Mark: Could you please take a quick look at this too and let me know if  you have any comments?  I'm at 33989.  Thanks. Carol 
 Jason: Could you help me review this?  I thought that given your review of some of the other agreements that you might have some helpful suggestions about what to look out for from our standpoint.  I have sent a copy of this to Mark Holsworth.  Thanks.  If we need to sit down with Mark Tawney and ask him questions about what this should cover, let me know. carol 
 Susan: I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go back to our old language.  Sara and Mark: Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can "hold" collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
 Rob: I am faxing to you our comments to the latest drafts of Schedules.  Our credit person has agreed to make the MAC trigger as an additional Termination Event so long as (1) we limit the trigger to the S&P rating; (2) we provide a cure concept that the non-Affected Party controls subject to a cap; and (3) we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership agreement, I seem to recall that you were reluctant to send us a copy as we traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that still the case?  I like what you did on the Termination Event but we need some comfort that you cannot alter or narrow the GP's liability that is provided by statute.  Could you please give that some thought and we can talk further about it?  Tomorrow is bad for me to talk but the rest of the week after tomorrow looks good if you have some time. Carol 
 Shari: I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:  1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6. I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?  2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed? They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating this.  Thanks in advance for your help.  Carol 
 Nedre: Per your request, here is what we have decided:  1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to her.  2. We have passed on the following candidates:  Stephanie Panus Patricia Slaughter Donald Duhon Debra Vincent   Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send their resume elsewhere.  Also, do you have references for Samantha?  Please call me if you need any additional information.   Carol 
 Shari:  I need your thoughts on 2 things:  We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some modifications to our Annex A.  Do you remember what those modifications were?  Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.  How do you think that this counterparty will react to getting a new form?  I loook forward to hearing from you.  Carol 
 Nedre: To the extent that she gives us references from her current employer (and I hope that she will) can one of us talk to them as well? Carol 
 Russell: Just wanted to confirm that what you said in your e-mail overrides what is in the credit worksheet as some of the numbers were different.  Please advise. Carol 
 Russell: Here is what their letter should say to us:  Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April 6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty."  Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in the space provided below. 
 Derek: Could you call me sometime this week so that we can discuss how to proceed with your counterparties on the Annex A mail-out?  Thanks. Carol

 Jason: Tomorrow or Thursday would be fine. Carol  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mark: Could you please answer Mark's question?  Alos, Jason Peters and I are still looking at this and we will call you with any further comments that we have. Carol  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Steve: Here is what I have found out from our credit and confirms people.  We are still confirming all trades with BT.  Further, when our credit person spoke with yours, they indicated that this would continue until a Master with DB is put in place.  Is all of this consistent with what you have heard?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 John: I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the Schedules:  1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part of the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?  2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.  3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?  4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger for that to go to zero is something else.  5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.  6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.  7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.  Please call me when convenient to discuss further.  Carol        Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Michael: I thought that you should be aware of this Transfer Agreement since it involves EEL.  Mark Holsworth has reviewed it and I am taking a look at it. If you have any thoughts or questions, please call me.  Hope all is going well with you and the group. Carol 
 Mark: I would like to see a draft of the License Agreement before we enter into the Transfer Agreement.  Alos, please ask them to send on Exhibits A through C for our review.  As a precaution, since this involves EEL, I have sent this to Michael Brown, my counterpart in London so he is aware of this.  He may have some comments.  Carol    Mark Tawney 05/09/2000 06:31 PM 
 Mark: Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only reason I'm asking is because I will be taking maternity leave at some point in time in the next 2-21/2 months and I want to make sure that if necessary, I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well. Carol 
 Mr. Stout: I just spoke with Stacy Dickson and she will be sending you by e-mail the final drafts of the 2 amendment agreements that we have prepared.  Please disregard what you have reviously received.  Sorry for any confusion that this may have caused. Carol 
 Cynthia: My folks are bugging me about getting this finalized.  Are you okay with the points that I raised?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mary: I'm waiting for Dave Forester to okay this but I have spoken with Matt Goering here a few times about this and I believe he has been in contact with Pruett.  I will give Pruett a call and let him know where things stand but until I hear from Dave, I can't do anything. carol    Mary Griff Gray 05/10/2000 09:28 AM 
 Joyce: I am working on the ETA amendment letter which I hope to send to you shortly.  We have a new procedure here where every amendment needs to be signed off by the head of the Online group so I need to get their blessing before I send it on to you.

 Mark: Enclosed is a revised draft of the Domain Transfer Agreement with my comments and questions inserted.  Please call when convenient to discuss.  Have you heard from Mark Palmer yet?  Alos, Mark Haedicke asked me to let John Lavorato know that we were entering into this Agreement and I will leave him with a voice mail today. Carol    Michael: Do you have any comments?  Also, are you okay with NY law and should we add an arbitration provision? 
 Susan and Susan: Could someone make sure that you check Marie's chair this week while she is gone for anything that needs to be acted on before she gets back?  Thanks. Carol 
 Scott: Mark Holsworth suggested that I send this draft Agreement to you which provides for Enron's transfer of the domain name weather-desk.com.  I am particular concerned about our ability to make the reps in Section 3.  What I am sending you reflects our comments to the other party's draft.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 David: Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Mark: This is the e-mail where DF objected to my proposed termination rights language that I would like to talk to you about so that we can come up with some language that I can use for those parties whom we have agreed have the right to terminate.  Could you please stop by when you have some time? Carol 
 Taffy: Could you please schedule a meeting for next week for our entire group (including Jason Peters) for 11/2 hours to go over changes that need to be made to our forms?  It might be nice given the amount of time to schedule around the lunch hour and order lunch.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Michael: John Lavorato asked that this matter be brought to the attention of John Sherriff.  Can you do this for me? Carol 
 Adele: I just faxed to you our final comments.  One open issue on our side was the amount of your Guaranty and our credit person has requested $15,000,000.  If the credit people need to talk about this, Tanya Rohauer's number is 713-853-3263.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Joe and Bob: Could someone bring to our luncheon tomorrow a copy of the "Special Handlings List"?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Veronica: You don't need to copy me on these so long as you copy all of the legal assistants.  Theyw ill make sure that either Sara or I review what they draft. Carol 
 Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualify Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using. Carol 
 Shari: Any thoughts on this? Carol 
 Tana: Here is the Enron Guaranty .  It is in my specproj/J Aron file named as Enron Guaranty FINAl.  Carol 
 Bill and Tanya: Enclosed is a list of "follow-up" items that we came up with based on what we talked about last Friday.  Maybe some of these can be discussed at our next group meeting next week so that we are clear on who is handling which issue. Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.  We really appreciate the enthusiasm that your group has for these seminars and look forward to doing more of them in the future. Carol

 David: Enclosed is a draft of the GPU Energy ETA amendment letter.  Leslie Hansen is working with them on the "affiliate" issue so there may be more to add to it.  Please let me know if you are okay with these amendments. carol 
 John: As we discussed, here is a draft of a proposed amendment letter which covers the issues that we talked about.  Depending upon how Leslie handles the affiliate issue, more may be added to this.  Alos, as I ,mentioned to you, this needs to be approved by the head of our Online group before I can sign off on it.  I am in the process o getting that approval. Carol 
 Sara: Here are the final forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC.  Susan: Please make sure that these are put into the form bank.  Carol 
 Susan: In preparation for our forms meeting next week could you please have your secretary prepare sets of the latest versions of the following for the group (Jason included):  1. ISDA Schedule 2. CSA Schedule plus LC provisions 3. Industrial Master 4. Annex A  - ENA and ECC 5. Annex B to Omnibus Form (include all collateral variations) 6. Canadian and US Tax Annexes 7. Guaranty Form  Did I miss any forms that we should talk about?   If they could be distributed by Monday  - Noon, that would be great.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Gary: I will draft something in the form of a disclaimer and send it to you.  Is this something that we are just doing for this customer or will this happen more frequently with other customers? Carol

 Susan: I hope to finalize the Master today on our conference call.  Could you please start pulling together the ENA and Enron Corp certificates?  They are alos requesting a W-9.  I would like to have all of these ready and executed by this time next week.  I will send you the Enron Guaranty after it has been finalized.  Thanks.  Call if you have any questions.  My contacts there are Adele Raspe and Maria Salvatore, her legal assistant. Carol 
 Susan: I would like to talk to you briefly next week sometime about what in your opinion would be the best way to train the new legal assistant that we plan to hire.  In particular, could you give some thought as to what worked the best for you and what didn't work.   I will keep whatever you say confidential.  I also have discussed with Mark that I want you to play a significant role in the training process given the outstanding progress that you have made in the last year.  Could you also give that some thought and let me know what you think?  Thanks. Carol 
 Shari: This looks fine to me. Carol    Shari Stack 05/12/2000 10:09 AM 
 David: Thanks.  I have left a message with Tanya at Merrill.  If they insist on making their change, I have some suggested language for them that will make it work. Carol    David P Dupre 05/12/2000 08:11 AM 
 Alicia and Trina: Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the swap docs:  Put Confirm  1. Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm 2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments and supplements  Harrier/Talon Schedule  1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13 2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.  3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not Enron Corp. 4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word "parties" the phrase "in connection with the Transactions hereunder." 5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted discloses in clause (iv) too broad?   Talon/Enron Schedule  1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added? 2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule? 3. Same comments as above  Master Derivatives Agreement  1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the $400,000,000 limitation?  For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should be reversed.  Talon Note  1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only benefit Enron and its affiliates.  Also,  what does it mean to refer to the Enron Guaranty here?  Enron Guaranty  1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think we can give on that point.  That's all that I have.  Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of "Net Talon Loss" versus "Loss"?   I'm available tomorrow to talk about these points. Carol 
 Susan: What is the status of this?  I would like to see a draft of the assignment and Termination Agreement soon.  Can you please prepare something for review sometime Monday?  Thanks. carol 
 David: I spoke with Tanya this morning and she is going to check with her people to see if this change really needs to be made. Carol    David P Dupre 05/12/2000 07:39 AM 
 Lisa: Per my voice mail, here is what I sent Frank.  Stacy Dickson has confirmed that all of the Physical answers are ok. Carol 
 Dave: 1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.  2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided nature of the indemnity language.  Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:26 PM 
 Dave: Richard Sanders , our litigation manager, was okay with this since this just defines the location of the arbitration, not necessarily who gets selected. With respect to your second question, I will talk to Mark about it and get back to you. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:16 PM 
 Adele: Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty. The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that results in its exposure being above the threshold. Carol 
 Dave: It's not specified that exactly.  The parties would have to agree on an exact site. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 02:57 PM

 Mark: Thanks for the update.  Monday is bad for me but TRuesday morning looks good if you could give me a call. Carol    Mark Evans 05/12/2000 03:44 AM 
 Scott: I will be there. Carol 
 I have a doctors appt Monday morning and will be in late in the morning.  Carol 
 Susan: Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks. Thanks. Carol 
 Brant: Their lawyer finally called me.  We have a few open credit issues on our side that I need for you to think about:   1. Are you okay with the cross default threshold on both sides being 3% of stockholders' equity?  They didn't like $100,000,000.  2. For corporate policy reasons, they cannot take advantage of affiliate setoff.  Since I wasn't sure what relationships ENA and its affiliates had with this counterparty, I wasn't sure how strongly you felt about it.  Please advise.  Carol 
 Karen: Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing condition is specified. Carol    "Karen Ector" <karen_ector@transcanada.com> 05/12/2000 04:42 PM 
 John: Our credit person has agreed to the 3% equity test for cross-default.  With respect to setoff, given our relationships with El Paso, this is an important credit point for us and one that I guess the credit people will need to discuss since it is important for us to have the Affiliate language.  Our credit person is Brant Reves (713-853-9897). Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Russell: Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp. Please advise.

 Rob: On the recording language issue, we can agree to the following:  Instead of limiting it to trading, marketing and scheduling personnel, we can agree that it is limited to all telephone communications that are made to or from each party's trading floor. This is because all calls that originate out of our trading area are always recorded no matter who picks up on the other line. Does that work for you?  I'm still checking on the confirmation/transaction tape issue.  Also, our credit person will agree to the Moody's trigger in the MAC language that we discussed.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Susan and John: We have finalized the amendment with Transcanada.  What we executed before still works.  We modified slightly the LC form.  They are faxing me their form of Guaranty and will send to Susan the docs.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Rob: We can accept your comment regarding resolving conflicts between executed confirms and Transaction Tapes.  Would you consider extending this to those confirms that are "deemed" executed as a result of a failure to respond within the period set forth in that section?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before trading.  Are the rules different in Australia? Carol 
 Dave: I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online. Carol     David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:16 PM

 John: Please disregard my earlier fax.  Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter. Carol St. Clair (713-853-3989) 
 John: The head of our Online group reviewed the letter that I sent to you last week and requested one change.  Enclosed is a marked and clean version of the ETA amendment letter which addresses all of the issues that we discussed and may need to be revised further to address the issues that you discussed with Leslie Hansen.

 Jim: At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses the termination issue.  Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online group.  This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I previously sent you, namely:  1. We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word "may" to "shall", due in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.  2. In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any reference to omissions.  I apologize for this.  Please call me after you have had a chance to review this.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Marie: I would like to fax and mail out the Annex A letters to the new counterparties to make sure that they all get them.  My secretary is available to help with the mail out which I would hope could be sent out no later than the end of the day Thursday given that we are going to be away.  I will let her know that you may be asking her to help.  I would alos want someone while we are gone to check all of the return faxes against our list so that they all go out to the right numbers.  Stop by if any of this is not do-able   Tahnks.  Carol 
 Adele: This looks fine to me.  I look forward to receiving your drafts. carol 
 Adele: I understand from my credit person that the new Guaranty caps will be set at $8,500,000.  I look forward to receiving from you the final drafts.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following:  "It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
 Sara: When ENA enters into an ISDA Master with a Canadian counterparty, is that counterparty expected to make the ESP and Options rep?  Does ENA make the Canadian Securities Act rep?  Carol 
 Susan: Could you please follow-up with Russell Martinson before our credit meeting tomorrow and see where things stand?  As I indicated ion my e-mail to him, we need to make sure that the effective date for the Transfer Agreement is dated so that all ARMS deals are covered.  Thanks. Carol 
 Trina and Alicia: Do you know who is commenting on the Enron reps and warranties mentioned in the cover memo either from your side or our side?  Also, Mark Evans is calling me tomorrow at 10 to go over the "New" structure.  Let me know if you want to be plugged in.  I'm not sure if the swap docs are affected.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Scott: I have been monitoring drafts of the swap docs.  Are you or someone else in your group reviewing the other docs that involve Enron Corp. such as the Certificate Purchase Agreement that appears to have a bunch of reps that Enron has to make?  I( have not been paying to much attention to the docs that don't involver the swap. Carol 
 Michael: Our guys are meeting with Risk Management Solutions tomorrow morning.  Scott Brown of V&E and I will be talking to them about the Agreement this afternoon.  Have you heard anything back from John Sherriff? Carol

 Lucy: We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the "weather" group to introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.  Could you send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara and I will do the rest?  Will a lunch work? Carol

 Susan: Please update me on this.  I realize you've been busy on other matters but please carve out some time to complete this so we can put this behind us. Thanks. Carol 
 Rod: Are you ready to talk about the outstanding Deutsche Bank issues that I e-mailed to you and is there any update on SG Interests? carol 
 Jeff: Now that Principal Subs has been taken out of the cross default provision, is there any need to refer to Subsidiaries in the definitions of Debt  or Permitted Receivables Purchase Facility ?    Carol St. Clair 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Suzanne: I'm pretty flexible.  The only days that appear to be bad if its done during lunch would be Friday, June 2 and Friday, June 16th.  As for ideas, I have NOTHING right now, but i know that Julia has some used stuff that she is going to give me.  We are planning on buying the furniture before the end of May.  As for the rest, I really hope to have all of that bought before the middle of June just in case. Carol    Suzanne Adams 05/16/2000 10:26 AM

 Susan: Please e-mail to Rob Rieth the information he needs to complete Part 5, Section (n) of the ISDA Schedule (wire transfer info).  Rob, With respect to Paragraph 13 (n) of the CSA Schedule, I think that we have already dealt with that in Paragraph 13 (l).  Carol 
 Mark and Taffy: I went ahead and registered for this and another class (ENA Orientation) to save a spot for Samantha.  We have until June 8th to cancel. Carol 
 Suzanne: We are going to try and schedule some more lunch meetings before I go on leave.  I would like to do one in early May, one in late May and one in JUne.  Could you please check the availability of  the conference room on 30 that we used last time and let me know what dates are open? Thanks. Carol 
 Mark and Taffy: Per my earlier e-mail, here is the other class that I registered for. Carol 
 Suzanne: Please make sure that you log in and select the people that should review you. Thanks. Carol 
 Maria: Could you please send me a redline of the Guaranty Agreements and LC (either by fax or e-mail) that crosses through and/or underlines the changes that were made?  Also, please send me a redline (either by fax or e-mail) of both the CSA (when it is ready) and ISDA Schedules that underlines or crosses through the changes that were made so that I can sign off on this.  The fax that I received did not indicate all chnages that were made in this way. Thanks.  Carol 
 Susan: Please give me a copy of the Transfer Agreement and I will respond. Carol 
 Russell: Thanks for your message.  I will take a look at the Transfer Agreement.  I just want to make sure that all trades done after May 3rd and before the execution date that are being confirmed under ARMS will be transferred to Utilicorp.  Alos, in order to change our online system, we need to know when the Utilicorp Master will be the operative document so that on and after such date, all deals are confirmed under the Master under the Utilicorp name.  Do you think that it would be better just to change the effective date of the Master and the Transfer Agreement to the date of Utilicorp's execution of the Master?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Martinson, Russell" <RMartins@UtiliCorp.com> 05/16/2000 02:05 PM 
 Adele and Maria: Here are my final comments:  1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes effective?  2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.  3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.  4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs to UCP.  That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your opinion shortly.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Rob: I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you about the following:  1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.  2. In the new language that you added in the "Recording" section, I don't think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very beginning where it says "that originates from and" the word "and" needs to be "or" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.  3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word "herein" to "this Agreement" and please change the last reference to "the Existing Transactions" to "this Agreement" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.  4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change the word "either" to "both" and the word "or" to "and", as I thought this is what we agreed to.  5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days and I will fax that to you.  I will be tied up until late morning but otherwise available.  Carol    "Robert J. Rieth" <rjr@houston.rr.com> 05/16/2000 04:38 PM

 Maria: I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and probably the PSE&G Guaranty:  1. Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns  2. In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads :"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged between the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")  Let me know if you have a problem with this.

 I have a quick follow up appointment tomorrow at 2:15.  I should be back in the office around 3:00.

Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000? Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it apply to the parties and their credit support providers?  OCCIDENTAL  Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?  Carol 
 Fred: Here is what we sent to Harry Stout.  Lisa has been requesting from them a copy of the pleadings to make sure that all of our requested changes have been made and as of yesterday, I don't think that she had received anything. I will keep you posted on the status of these amendments.  Lisa is the best person to advise you on the status of the bankruptcy proceedings and the timing of getting an order signed so that you can commence trading. Carol 
 Russell: I have left repeated voice mail messages with Katie Flaherty, their attorney, and received no response.  I think that someone needs to make a commercial call so that we can resolve the issues raised in  my 4/28 letter. Carol 
 Dave: The above counterparty has requested the following changes to the ETA:  1. Make the reps in section 2(d) reciprocal  2. Make the assignment provision in Section 6(b) reciprocal  3. In Section 6(c), insert the word "its" between the words "all" and "third".  Please advise.  Carol  3. 
 Tana: Could you please talk to Anthony about the need for video conferencing as he mentioned something to Suzanne about needing that and let Suzanne know if we will be hooking anyone else in and if so, who and how?  Alos, does a total of 20 people (which includes our group) sound right to you?  Finally, what time do you want to start?  We have the room from 11:30 to 2?  Please let Suzanne know the above details.  Thanks.  Carol

 Brant: Is this what was agreed to?  When we last spoke, it appeared as if you had not agreed to a collateral threshold of $50M and a cap of $55M.  Please advise. Carol 
 Steve: I have reviewed what you sent to Susan Bailey and it looks fine.  Please forward to Susan Bailey for execution after you have  had it executed at your shop.  Thanks.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 John: Please send Susan Flynn contact information for this counterparty so that we can send them our form of CA for the financial info that they intend to give us.  I'm assuming that this is in connection with swaps that we will be doing with them.  If there is anything else that we need to describe in the CA please let Susan know.  Thanks.

 Brant: We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:  1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP); 2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.  Here is what I need to know from you:  1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.  2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok Gas Marketing Master?  Please advise.  Carol 
 Maria: Thanks.  I already did the Enron Guaranty yesterday and it is being signed hopefully today.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Salvatore, Maria" <Maria.Salvatore@pseg.com> 05/18/2000 12:08 PM 
 Susan: FYI.  Ignore the Enron Guaranty but make sure that the PSE&G Guaranty that you eventually get conforms to this. Carol 
 Joe: I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that. Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?  Carol    Larry Joe Hunter 05/18/2000 12:14 PM 
 Leslie: Dave Forster must sign off on all ETA amendments that we do.  It may be a good idea for you to send him the new ETA amendment letter and walk him through the chnages that you have made to address your issues so that he understands what is going on.  If you want me to be involved in that conversation, I'm happy to participate.  Thanks. Carol    Leslie Hansen 05/18/2000 03:42 PM

I would like to try to get those issues addressed next week with the people that we need to talk to so that we can turn a draft of the ISDA Schedules, so please make this a priority.  Thanks.

 Pam: How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got about another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over with.  I hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me. Are you free for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up. E-mail me back with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said hi.  Carol

 Mark: I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it and use it with respect to the products that they offer.  All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names. We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language:  1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court?  2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.  I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions.  Carol 
 Greg: Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?  1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we should
