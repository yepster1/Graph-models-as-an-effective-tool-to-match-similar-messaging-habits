 Rob: We can accept your comment regarding resolving conflicts between executed confirms and Transaction Tapes.  Would you consider extending this to those confirms that are "deemed" executed as a result of a failure to respond within the period set forth in that section?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before trading.  Are the rules different in Australia? Carol 
 Dave: I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online. Carol     David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:16 PM

 Mary: A draft of the amendment letter to the ETA was sent by fax today to John Puett. Carol 
 John: Please disregard my earlier fax.  Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter. Carol St. Clair (713-853-3989) 
 John: The head of our Online group reviewed the letter that I sent to you last week and requested one change.  Enclosed is a marked and clean version of the ETA amendment letter which addresses all of the issues that we discussed and may need to be revised further to address the issues that you discussed with Leslie Hansen.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Joyce: Enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter.  Sorry that this took so long.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Jim: At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses the termination issue.  Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online group.  This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I previously sent you, namely:  1. We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word "may" to "shall", due in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.  2. In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any reference to omissions.  I apologize for this.  Please call me after you have had a chance to review this.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Marie: I would like to fax and mail out the Annex A letters to the new counterparties to make sure that they all get them.  My secretary is available to help with the mail out which I would hope could be sent out no later than the end of the day Thursday given that we are going to be away.  I will let her know that you may be asking her to help.  I would alos want someone while we are gone to check all of the return faxes against our list so that they all go out to the right numbers.  Stop by if any of this is not do-able   Tahnks.  Carol 
 Adele: This looks fine to me.  I look forward to receiving your drafts. carol 
 Adele: I understand from my credit person that the new Guaranty caps will be set at $8,500,000.  I look forward to receiving from you the final drafts.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following:  "It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
 Sara: When ENA enters into an ISDA Master with a Canadian counterparty, is that counterparty expected to make the ESP and Options rep?  Does ENA make the Canadian Securities Act rep?  Carol 
 Susan: Could you please follow-up with Russell Martinson before our credit meeting tomorrow and see where things stand?  As I indicated ion my e-mail to him, we need to make sure that the effective date for the Transfer Agreement is dated so that all ARMS deals are covered.  Thanks. Carol 
 Trina and Alicia: Do you know who is commenting on the Enron reps and warranties mentioned in the cover memo either from your side or our side?  Also, Mark Evans is calling me tomorrow at 10 to go over the "New" structure.  Let me know if you want to be plugged in.  I'm not sure if the swap docs are affected.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Scott: I have been monitoring drafts of the swap docs.  Are you or someone else in your group reviewing the other docs that involve Enron Corp. such as the Certificate Purchase Agreement that appears to have a bunch of reps that Enron has to make?  I( have not been paying to much attention to the docs that don't involver the swap. Carol 
 Michael: Our guys are meeting with Risk Management Solutions tomorrow morning.  Scott Brown of V&E and I will be talking to them about the Agreement this afternoon.  Have you heard anything back from John Sherriff? Carol

 Adele: Please see the enclosed draft opinion.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Adele and Maria: The date of the earliest outstanding trade is 11/29/99 so that is what I think we should date the docs.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Lucy: We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the "weather" group to introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.  Could you send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara and I will do the rest?  Will a lunch work? Carol 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Susan: Please update me on this.  I realize you've been busy on other matters but please carve out some time to complete this so we can put this behind us. Thanks. Carol 
 Rod: Are you ready to talk about the outstanding Deutsche Bank issues that I e-mailed to you and is there any update on SG Interests? carol 
 Jeff: Now that Principal Subs has been taken out of the cross default provision, is there any need to refer to Subsidiaries in the definitions of Debt  or Permitted Receivables Purchase Facility ?    Carol St. Clair 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Rob: I'm checking with my credit person about your deletion of our amendment to the Specified Transaction cross default and then I will call you with my remaining comments.

 Suzanne: I'm pretty flexible.  The only days that appear to be bad if its done during lunch would be Friday, June 2 and Friday, June 16th.  As for ideas, I have NOTHING right now, but i know that Julia has some used stuff that she is going to give me.  We are planning on buying the furniture before the end of May.  As for the rest, I really hope to have all of that bought before the middle of June just in case. Carol    Suzanne Adams 05/16/2000 10:26 AM 
 Nora: You may want to let the folks at Milbank and V&E know to send you stuff instead of Scott.  My contacts in Houston from V&E are Trina and Alicia and in London is Jeff Eldredge.  Mark Evans is my internal legal contact in London. Carol

 Susan: Please e-mail to Rob Rieth the information he needs to complete Part 5, Section (n) of the ISDA Schedule (wire transfer info).  Rob, With respect to Paragraph 13 (n) of the CSA Schedule, I think that we have already dealt with that in Paragraph 13 (l).  Carol 
 Mark and Taffy: I went ahead and registered for this and another class (ENA Orientation) to save a spot for Samantha.  We have until June 8th to cancel. Carol 
 Suzanne: We are going to try and schedule some more lunch meetings before I go on leave.  I would like to do one in early May, one in late May and one in JUne.  Could you please check the availability of  the conference room on 30 that we used last time and let me know what dates are open? Thanks. Carol 
 Mark and Taffy: Per my earlier e-mail, here is the other class that I registered for. Carol 
 Suzanne: Please make sure that you log in and select the people that should review you. Thanks. Carol 
 Maria: Could you please send me a redline of the Guaranty Agreements and LC (either by fax or e-mail) that crosses through and/or underlines the changes that were made?  Also, please send me a redline (either by fax or e-mail) of both the CSA (when it is ready) and ISDA Schedules that underlines or crosses through the changes that were made so that I can sign off on this.  The fax that I received did not indicate all chnages that were made in this way. Thanks.  Carol 
 Susan: Please give me a copy of the Transfer Agreement and I will respond. Carol 
 Russell: Thanks for your message.  I will take a look at the Transfer Agreement.  I just want to make sure that all trades done after May 3rd and before the execution date that are being confirmed under ARMS will be transferred to Utilicorp.  Alos, in order to change our online system, we need to know when the Utilicorp Master will be the operative document so that on and after such date, all deals are confirmed under the Master under the Utilicorp name.  Do you think that it would be better just to change the effective date of the Master and the Transfer Agreement to the date of Utilicorp's execution of the Master?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Martinson, Russell" <RMartins@UtiliCorp.com> 05/16/2000 02:05 PM 
 Adele and Maria: Here are my final comments:  1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes effective?  2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.  3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.  4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs to UCP.  That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your opinion shortly.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Rob: I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you about the following:  1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.  2. In the new language that you added in the "Recording" section, I don't think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very beginning where it says "that originates from and" the word "and" needs to be "or" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.  3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word "herein" to "this Agreement" and please change the last reference to "the Existing Transactions" to "this Agreement" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.  4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change the word "either" to "both" and the word "or" to "and", as I thought this is what we agreed to.  5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days and I will fax that to you.  I will be tied up until late morning but otherwise available.  Carol    "Robert J. Rieth" <rjr@houston.rr.com> 05/16/2000 04:38 PM

 Maria: I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and probably the PSE&G Guaranty:  1. Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns  2. In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads :"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged between the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")  Let me know if you have a problem with this.

 I have a quick follow up appointment tomorrow at 2:15.  I should be back in the office around 3:00. 
 Rob: Susan Flynn tells me that the earliest outstanding trade is dated April 8, 1999 which is what I think the ISDA should be dated.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Brant: I need your help in answering the following questions:  EL PASO  Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000? What are the Guaranty caps? Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000? Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it apply to the parties and their credit support providers?  OCCIDENTAL  Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?  Carol 
 Fred: Here is what we sent to Harry Stout.  Lisa has been requesting from them a copy of the pleadings to make sure that all of our requested changes have been made and as of yesterday, I don't think that she had received anything. I will keep you posted on the status of these amendments.  Lisa is the best person to advise you on the status of the bankruptcy proceedings and the timing of getting an order signed so that you can commence trading. Carol 
 Russell: I have left repeated voice mail messages with Katie Flaherty, their attorney, and received no response.  I think that someone needs to make a commercial call so that we can resolve the issues raised in  my 4/28 letter. Carol 
 Dave: The above counterparty has requested the following changes to the ETA:  1. Make the reps in section 2(d) reciprocal  2. Make the assignment provision in Section 6(b) reciprocal  3. In Section 6(c), insert the word "its" between the words "all" and "third".  Please advise.  Carol  3. 
 Tana: Could you please talk to Anthony about the need for video conferencing as he mentioned something to Suzanne about needing that and let Suzanne know if we will be hooking anyone else in and if so, who and how?  Alos, does a total of 20 people (which includes our group) sound right to you?  Finally, what time do you want to start?  We have the room from 11:30 to 2?  Please let Suzanne know the above details.  Thanks.  Carol

 Brant: Is this what was agreed to?  When we last spoke, it appeared as if you had not agreed to a collateral threshold of $50M and a cap of $55M.  Please advise. Carol 
 Steve: I have reviewed what you sent to Susan Bailey and it looks fine.  Please forward to Susan Bailey for execution after you have  had it executed at your shop.  Thanks.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 John: Please send Susan Flynn contact information for this counterparty so that we can send them our form of CA for the financial info that they intend to give us.  I'm assuming that this is in connection with swaps that we will be doing with them.  If there is anything else that we need to describe in the CA please let Susan know.  Thanks.

 Brant: We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:  1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP); 2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.  Here is what I need to know from you:  1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.  2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok Gas Marketing Master?  Please advise.  Carol 
 Maria: Thanks.  I already did the Enron Guaranty yesterday and it is being signed hopefully today.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Salvatore, Maria" <Maria.Salvatore@pseg.com> 05/18/2000 12:08 PM 
 Susan: FYI.  Ignore the Enron Guaranty but make sure that the PSE&G Guaranty that you eventually get conforms to this. Carol 
 Joe: I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that. Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?  Carol    Larry Joe Hunter 05/18/2000 12:14 PM 
 Leslie: Dave Forster must sign off on all ETA amendments that we do.  It may be a good idea for you to send him the new ETA amendment letter and walk him through the chnages that you have made to address your issues so that he understands what is going on.  If you want me to be involved in that conversation, I'm happy to participate.  Thanks. Carol    Leslie Hansen 05/18/2000 03:42 PM

 Mark: I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it and use it with respect to the products that they offer.  All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names. We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language:  1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court?  2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.  I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions.  Carol 
 Greg: Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?  1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?  2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Shari: Before I call their attorney about this I would like to talk with you briefly about the open issues and how negfotiations in the past have gone.  Please stop by.  I'll be tied up most of the afternoon until around 5 or so. Carol

 John and Molly: I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already notified them that they needed to post collateral:  1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination Date.  The "Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation (and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequently provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.  As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all outstanding trades.  All notices will need to be sent by federal express delivery such that they won't be effective until the day after they have been sent out.

 Tana: I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May 25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something up with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what to do with the credit group.  Carol

 Susan: I spoke with Utilicorp's contract person today and we have decided to do the following:  1. Leave the ISDA dated May 3, 2000 2. Change the Assignment Effective Date in the Transfer Agreement to whatever date we agree upon with Utilicorp.  Apparently, the ISDA has not been signed yet but will be by them in the next few days.  Until Russell comes back, they cannot sign the Transfer Agreement.  Could you please do the following this week:  1. Have the enclosed new form of Transfer Agreement signed and sent to Russell.  Leave the date on Page 1 blank. 2. Send to Russell the additional certificate that he is requesting attaching ENA's resolutions. Thanks.    Brant: How much lead time to we need to make the switch online?  Does Utilicorp have a password?  I'm hopeful that by sometime next week, they will sign the Transfer Agreement so that all trades could be confirmed under Utilicorp. 
 Maria: Your opinion looks fine.  Is ours okay? carol

We alos left a voice mail message for Lou about getting outside counsel involved on the insurance/derivative issue.  Finally, do you have a list of proposed counterparties that you can send to us?  To the extent that approvals need to be obtained to trade with these counterparties, it may be a good idea to get that going. Carol    Gaurav Babbar 05/22/2000 02:05 PM

 John: I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points that I wanted him to confirm.  The only change that he raised was on the cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.    I will send you a new mark up on that.  Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated in your draft.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Sandy: Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can respond to some but not all of such comments at this point:  1. With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.  2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it.  3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of setoff rights.  4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.  5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.  6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?  I look forward to hearing from you.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) E-Mail Carol.St.Clair@enron.com

 Rhett: You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax". Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I think is very similar to what we were looking at before:  Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or office located in such jurisdiction.  In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.  Do you think that we can or should accept this?

 Steve: I am faxing to you my response to your Guarnty comments.  While we are waiting on my credit person, would it be possible to get a redraft of the schgedules from you since a good portion of the comments that we discussed I beleieve we agreed to and would help me focus on what is left to discuss with my people?  We have alos modified recently our form of LC and I have enclosed it for your review.  Thanks.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mark, Jason and Sara:  Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various "Securities Act" reps in the ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require us and them to say:  1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption.  2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor.  3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer.  What do you think about this?  Carol

 John: I am checking with our credit person on the cxross default issue.  Also, we have changed our form of Guaranty since the prior one was entered into and I would prefer that you consider using the new form.  The main difference is in Section 2 where we have made chnages to the mechanics for demanding payment under the Guaranty.  These are the exact same mechanics that are in the Enron Guaranty that I provideed.  Enclosed is the new form.  Let me know what you think.

 Susan and Susan: In an effort to better manage your work flows, Sara and I would like to meet with you for about 30 minutes this week to get an idea of what's on your plate and what we can do to ease the work load.  Could you please give this some thought and let Taffy know when you want to meet so she can get it set up?  Thanks. Carol

 Russell: I will draft something up later today for you  to look at.  With respect to Richardson Products, the July 29, 1999 Guaranty in the second paragraph already picks up all ECT affiliates which would include HPL, such that any physical contract between ECT or its affiliates and Richardson Products II, Ltd. would already be covered.  Their letter mentions an April 28th Guaranty.  Does one exist?  Why I don't think that we need to say anything with respect to the July 29th Guaranty, it certainly wouldn't hurt for them to simply send us a letter referencing this Guaranty and stating that it is their understanding that the term "ECT Affiliates" as used in the Guaranty  includes Houston Pipe Line Company.

 Tanya: Here is a summary of what has been agreed to with El Paso:  Cross Default Threshold - $100,000,000 for each of us.  They want this just to apply at the Credit Support provider level Guaranty Cap - $55,000,000 for each of us Collateral Threshold - $50,000,000; Rounding at $250,000.  No minimum transfer amount Setoff may possibly still be open re affiliates but I think that they will come around on this  Carol

If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.  As far as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6 and in the Confirmation language let's offer up 5 Business days. Carol

It is managed by a Board of 3 reps selected by each member and for this purpose, Global and Montello are treated as 1 member and YPF is treated as 1 member.

 Russell: I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be signed in a few days.  I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer Agreement which has a blank for the date.  My thought was that everything would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.

 David: The confirm that you sent me is a confirm with a different entity called Southern Company Energy Marketing, LP which is different from the above counterparty and is subject to an ISDA Master.    The company on the updated list that we received from Mary had a fax number of 205-257-5792 an ID # of 26428 and is located in Birmingham Alabama. Carol 
 Leslie: I would run everything passed Dave Forester since we need his approval on the amendment letter for your piece anyway and see what he says. Carol    Leslie Hansen 05/30/2000 01:11 PM 
 Brando: We already have a Master Agreement with Swiss Re in place so I don't understand why we would enter into another one with them to do online trades.  Please call me to discuss.  Also, Mark Tawney and Paul Henery had sent up for my review a form of ELRIX GA Participation Agreement which I had sent them comments and questions on.  Is that related to this?  It would be helpful to me if perhaps you, mark and i could meet so you could explain to me what we are trying to accomplish.  My assistant Suzanne Adams (37340) can help you set something up.  Carol  P.S.  The agreement that you sent to me refers to ELRIX Website Terms and Conditions and ELRIX Weather Derivatives Privacy Policy, both of which I need to see.

 Steven : I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with Rod Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:  1. We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default provision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.  2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for "materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?  3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps). Is that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do more with netting across product lines.  4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.  I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules and will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.  Carol 
 Russell: Please see the enclosed letter 
 Sue: Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do, things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.  Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch. Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is good practice for when the baby comes.  Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in august.  Let me know what you think.  How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.  What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the rest of the year off.  I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to catch up with you sometime.  I love you!  Carol 
 Joe: Per my voice mail message, here is a description of the online product that we are  looking to create. Carol 
 Scott and Bruce: I understand from talking to Jane this morning that we will be able to work with you as our counsel on the above transaction that we are working with ACE on.  My understanding from our commercial people is that we should be getting a redraft of the insurance policy sometime today with ACE which we will need your help in reviewing.  Leslie Hansen and I will be working on this from the legal end, with Leslie's focus being on the "power" issues and mine on the "derivative" issues.  As I mentioned to Scott last week, we will alos need your help in making sure that the derivative taht we draft is not construed to be insurance.  A draft of the confirmation taht we anticipate using will be sent out later this week.  In terms of timing, our goal is to be on-line by June 15th which will require us to try to get all documentation finalized as soon as possible.  I will keep you posted on any updates to our schedule.  Please feel free to call me or Leslie (713-853-6121) with any questions.  If there are others that we need to add to our distribution, please let me know.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com   Gaurav: Could you please add Bruce Wright to the Distribution List.  His number is 212-424-8620.  Please circulate to the Enron group, Bruce and Scott a Distribution List with the information for the Enron people that are involved.  Thanks. 
 Tanya: We still don't have it and we were hoping that someone on the commercial side would place a call to J Aron.  We agreed to it weeks ago and there is no reason why we shouldn't have it by now.  Since the existing Guaranty does not cover the new Master I do not consider the new Master to be effective. Apparently there is some confusion on J Aron's part since they keep referring to the new Master in their confirms.  I have left a message for their counsel, Luanne Giessen, that we do not consider the new Master effective until we receive the new Guaranty.  Tana has left numerous messages with her alos about getting the Guaranty. Carol    Tanya Rohauer 05/31/2000 09:28 AM

 Rod:  There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:  1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across product lines.  Are you okay with this?  2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations required under each transaction that we enter into with them. Specifically, the CA does the following:  - calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash Settlement Amount payable - gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates - determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred  Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially requested no cap.   On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following credit issues:  1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified Transaction.  2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?  3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define "materially weaker" as either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.  4. On setoff, they did not have the "affiliate" language.  5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.  AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000 A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000 BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000 BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000  Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.   7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:  - If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written demand by the Secured Party - if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of dishonor - if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy - 3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party  In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the time period is 5 Business Days      On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.   Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Paul: Did you mean to refer to dates in June?

 John: My fault.  It should say "succeeding Scheduled Payment Date" and Scheduled Payment Date is defined in Section 14 of the ISDA form.  As far as choice of law, we can go with NY although I disagree with your counsel, in that in order for the New York choice of law to be enforced by a court, the parties have to demonstrate some minimum relationship with the jurisdiction chose.

 Suzanne: In case anyone asks you, we have decided to name the baby Charles Eugene. carol 
 Sara and Jason: Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used in each conform:  Payment Date NCDC NWS HDD CDD The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station Data Sources  Let me know what you think.  Carol  Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already set forth in the Master? 
 Shari: The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this? Carol 
 Charles was my mother's dad's name and Eugene is my dad's name.    Suzanne Adams 06/01/2000 11:01 AM 
 Sara and Jason: Shari's response to the message that I sent to you. Carol 
 Mark and Jarrod: Regarding this project of streamlining weather confirms, Shari asked about the new language that we were gong to use to define the procedures for determining the Fallback reference Weather Station.  Has that language ever been finalized?  This is one of the things that I thought we could pull out of the confirms so before we send out any Master Agreement amendments, we should try to get this language finalized. Carol 
 Scott, Bruce, Sam and John: Gaurav has informed me that the next draft of the ACE insurance policy will be distributed by ACE sometime tomorrow.

Finally, it's my understanding that the comparison Annex A that we will attach to the letter will be the new Annex A that has been compared to the old annex a with the name change.  Thanks. Carol

 Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop. As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at 1(Houston time).  Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.  I don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any of you would be available for this call.  Please let me know.

 Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:  1. In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated Subsidiary can be deleted.  2. In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it relates to the Assigned Interest)"?  In other words, if these events as to Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?  3. I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross default language that Enron is now using.  4. In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".  Nora: Per my voice mail message to you, I'm assuming that you are okay with Section 5.6.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Russell: There are several credit issues here that we need to discuss like:  1. Their comment on the affiliate language in the setoff provision - I don't think that they understand how this works.  2. Their first and second comments to the CSA.  3. Their comment in the CSA about requiring a different standard for holding collateral.  4. Their desire to change from Fed Funds Rate to LIBOR  5. Their renewal notice comment concerning the LC.   Please call me to discuss.  Also, Susan Bailey and I need to talk with you about Global Companies LLC. Carol    Russell Diamond 06/02/2000 04:26 PM 
 Jeff, Stacy and Harry: We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as something credit can send to counterparties? Thanks. carol 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Alicia The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined (i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case "affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or some other def?

 Steve: I spoke with Rod Nelson, our credit person, about the cross default language and we have the following proposal to make.  We are okay with the language as it applies to declaring a an Event of Default and then declaring an early Termination Date.  For purposes of triggering a reduction of the collateral threshold to zero, we would propose that this language would not apply such that an event of Default would be triggered upon the occurrence of the cross default.  Let me know what you think. Carol

 Tanya and Sara: Just an update on the ones that I am handling:  Aquila/Utilicorp will be in place tomorrow Idacorp should be done this week as i spoke with their counsel today Pancanadian  - we are waiting for them to decide whether they will accept the ISDA form of CSA Reliant - we do have their form and Rod and I are working through credit issues El Paso - I am waiting for a revised draft from them but we are close J Aron - done    Tanya Rohauer 06/05/2000 03:25 PM 
 Sara: What do you think? Carol 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Joe: If we need to develop a form of confirm for this, are you the person that I should work with or would someone else handle this?  Rod, Since we are doing a separate GTC for this product, we will not be able to "net" on any payment date what we owe the counterparty under this product against what the counterparty may owe us under other derivative products. Are you okay with this?  Alos, we have been assuming that there are no other counterparty credit issues with this product since other than the upfront premium, payments will be made from us to them.  Are we safe in assuming this? Carol 
 Mark: Here is a summary of what I am currently working on. Carol 
 Rob: Enclosed is what I think should be the final form of the Schedules.  I have made some clean-up chnages.  In the LC,. my notes indicate that we were going to keep the renewal language in.  Please let me know if this draft is okay with you and then we will coordinate getting it executed.  Thanks for your help. Carol

 Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and here is what we concluded needed to be done:  1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial language  2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language.  3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all circumstances it will say the following:  Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in ________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in _______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________.   Susan Bailey, Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC?  If you have any questions, please call me or Sara.  Carol 
 Suzanne: I need to schedule a 1 hour meeting with Julia to talk about maternity leave issues.  Could you please work with her secretary to set something up next week?  Thanks. Carol 
 Jeff: We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this procedure? Carol 
 Susan: Regarding Kate's e-mail, I have left a voice mail for Richard Sanders as to which office we should designate.  If you need to send out the ISDA draft before I hear back from him and before Kate hears back from Canada, go ahead and leave the address blank and we can fill it in later. Carol 
 Mark and Sara: Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous. The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.  On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to work better is through "communicating" to each other.  I firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.  I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.  Carol 
 Bill: I would like to go to this.  Okay with you? Carol 
 Rhett: I have asked the attorney that I am working with on this to call you directly about their proposed tax rep language as well as their deletion of the language in Part 3 regarding the delivery of tax docs.  I have enclosed below the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not accept and I believe you have their proposed language on the tax reps. Thanks again for your help.  I just think that at this point it is easier for the tax folks to talk directly to each other. Carol 
 Tana: Mark has asked me to handle the Mexico issues in connection with EOL trading.  I understand that you have copies of what has been sent to and received from Mexican counsel.  Could you before you leave tomorrow give me copies of all correspondence as well as copies of the more current questionnaires taht we have been sending out so that I can start following up with them on Monday?  Thanks. Carol 
 Brant: In response to your voice mail regarding El Paso, Occidental and Aquila Canada, I can follow up with my contacts at El Paso and Occidental.  Please provide me with the name of the attorney at Aquila Canada and I will call him or her.  Carol 
 Mark: Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:  1. In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may be delayed?  2. Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of Liability sections of both Schedules?  Carol

 Jason: I thought that your drfat letter of intent looked fine.  Just a few commments.  In section 6 - Conditions, could you put something in there similar to the "Approvals" section in the November 10th letter since possibly HSR and FERC approval may be needed?  Alos, in Attachment A, in Section 3 could you sya something to the effect that if tthere is no master in place with Enron and a particular counterparty then Enron needs to be satisfied with the terms of the master that is in place between Mrechant and such counterparty.  I thought that the Assignment Agreement was very weak and that we need something more than that.  Withg respect to the consent, the concept of the assigned transaction be goverened by our Master needs to be in there. Enclosed is the template that we have used in the Columbia deal.  Call me if you have any questions.  The only time that I won't be reachable today is from 11:30-2.  Carol 
 Gaurav: I sent to Bruce Wright our comments to the policy last night and asked that he incorporate them into his mark-uo and distribute it to ACE and us.  Please e-mail him with your fax number as well as the fax numbers for the people at Ace.  Thanks. Carol 
 Tana: My understanding on Utilicorp is that the earliest that the Master would become effective is June 16th.  We will keep you posted.    Tana Jones 06/09/2000 09:46 AM 
 Brant: FYI. Carol 
 Cement: Enclosed is the Enron Guaranty that we need executed in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement that we have finalized with Idacorp Energy Solutions LP.  We would like to have the Master become effective next week so would it be possible to have this signed next week?  If you have any questions, please call me or Susan Flynn. Carol 
 Rob: I received the documents and Susan Flynn will get them executed along with the Enron Guaranty and the other certificates and get them back to you next week.  My question for you is when you consider the agreement to be effective for trading purposes?  I'm assuming you want to wait for the Enron Guaranty and that any trades done before the Guaranty is sent to you would not be confirmed under the Master.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.  I have asked Enron's counsel to process the Guaranty ASAP.  Thanks. Carol 
 John: I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Shuttee, John" <ShutteeJ@EPEnergy.com> 06/09/2000 01:15 PM

 Ladies: I just wanted to thank you again for your thoughtfulness, support  and hard work in making today such a special event for me and Charles Eugene!  As I said at the shower, I'm lucky to have people like you as friends and co-workers and each of you throughout the last year has helped me get through this pregnancy and the events leading up to it, for which I am extremely grateful.  I am truly overwhelmed by everyone's generosity and look forward to finally putting all of my gifts to good use in the upcoming weeks. Carol 
 Scott: At Paul Radous' request I am sending you the form of LC for the prospective issuing bank to look at.  I'm at ext. 33989 if you have any questions. Carol

 Joe: Can you take a look at the product description that we have drafted in the next day or two and let me know how we can turn this into a confirm? Thanks. Carol 
 Carolyn: I'm hoping that you can help me with this.  One  of the gifts that I received on Friday was 2 outfits from Baby Gap.  There was no card.  The only people that were at the shower that I couldn't account for based on the gifts that I received with cards and group gift list that I saw were Anne Yaeger, Mark Taylor, Tana Jones and Mary Heinitz.  Could you please confirm for me that these people did not participate on the group gift?  Thanks. Carol 
 Dave: I will check with Tana on this and yes, she will handle the notifications. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 06/12/2000 09:23 AM 
 Tana: Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection is that maybe only 1 or 2 did. Carol 
 Carolyn: Thanks.  If there is some discreet way to check with Mark, Anne, Tana and Mary about this I would really appreciate it.  I'm guessing that the gift came from Anne.  Again, it was from Baby Gift on University Blvd. and it was 2 one piece outfits - 1 with an Elephant/Turtle/Bear design and 1 with a Monkey design.  Thanks for your help. Carol     Carolyn George@ENRON 06/12/2000 12:21 PM 
 Robin: Did either the high chair or the stroller come with an instruction booklet that I could have?  If so, just let me know who to contact and I will do so. If not, I suppose I can spend the next few years trying to figure out how they work!! Thanks. Carol 
 Steve: Please see the enclosed. Carol 
 I would like to take the following as vacation days:  Friday, April 21 Friday, May 26th  Please advise if there is a problem with taking these days.  Carol 
 Carolyn: Thanks.  I'm going to assume that it came from Anne. Carol    Carolyn George@ENRON 06/12/2000 02:19 PM 
 Anne: I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?  Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  I am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try to see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.  Carol 
 Joe: Could you please send me what you've done and I'll revise as necessary? Thanks. Carol    Larry Joe Hunter 06/12/2000 02:15 PM

 Please plan to attend a lunch this coming Friday in 30C2 with Sara and I and possibly some of the newer credit people to go through basic ISDA, CSA and confirmation issues.  We'll get started around Noon and probably go until 1:30.  Carol 
 Tanya: This coming Friday Sara and I are going to walk the legal assistants through some basic concepts with respect to the ISDA and CSA Schedules and confirmations.  Do you think that we should invite some of the newer credit people to this and if so, who?  Some of this will be a repeat of what we did a few weeks ago but at a more basic level.  We were thinking that it may be beneficial for Nidia Mendoza and Cathy Tudon.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
 Mark: Please see the enclosed draft CA. Carol 
 Susan: Please coordinate this.  Thanks. Carol 
 Leslie: FYI. CArol 
 David: On the last indemnity point, instead of us giving an actual indemnity, I think that it would be better just to exclude from their indemnity such losses.  That is what Mark and I have done in the past.  CArol 
 Mike: I have sent this to my credit person and I will let you know what he thinks. Carol    <Mike_Pate@oxy.com> 06/12/2000 02:00 PM

 Jeff: Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent would be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role that Enron Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am looking at a June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the language in Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.

 Willie: Thanks for your voice mail message.    As I explained to Joe and David, on all of the counterparties where we have "EOL Issues" I need to know what those issues are and then I will call them.  Could you please advise Joe and/or David about this and then I will follow up.  The only issue that we discussed was the issue that these counterparties are thinking that the clicking requirement in the ETA applies to confirms which it doesn't.  Thanks for your help. Carol 
 Jeff: I'm avavilable from 2:45 to 3:30 and then after 4:45.  Tomorrow I'm pretty much free as well.  I will not be able to review these drafts until later tonight.  Carol

 Jeff: Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron is the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term "Event of Default" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For example, 7(b)(ii) seems to be a trigger that could accidentally happen and the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Eldredge, Jeff" <jeldredge@velaw.com> 06/14/2000 04:20 AM

 Joe: Here is my stab at a form of confirm reply letter.  This one assumes that we are the confirming party but it can be modified if the counterparty is the confirming party and we want to send this.  I will work on  modifying Southern's cover letter into something that we could send to our counterparties.  Call me if you have any questions. Carol

Please let me know if there are other things that may cause the waiver period to expire early. Carol 
 Jason: Sorry I left you off of this.  Please let Suzanne know if you can attend.  It will now be held in 38c2. Carol 
 Yes, and I've assumed that she is coming.  I also invited Jason and asked him to get back to you.  Let's wait and see how large the group is and decide if we need to relocate if that is possible.  Might there be any conference rooms that are larger if we need it (like on 44)?  If not, we will make do but will need someone to bring us some extra chairs.    Suzanne Adams 06/14/2000 11:01 AM

 Russell: I will take a look at the Guaranty and get back to you but my recollection was that the termination provisions did not make clear that the Guaranty would remain in place with respect to obligations that arose after the termination date with respect to transactions that were entered into prior to the termination date and taht was the concept that needs to be addressed.

K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP")  We have Masters with both of these entities.   I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following will occur once it becomes effective:  1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to Oneok LP.  2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the Oneok II Master.  In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes from the parent Onoek Inc.  Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.   Carol 
 Ed: Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and the Counterparty Guaranty. Carol 
 Tanya: Thank you for suggesting the group that we talked to today.  They all seemed to be at the same level and hopefully got something out of what we said today.  I mentioned to them that you have all of the latest LC and Guaranty forms and that you would be sending those around to them.  I will work on the form of confidentiality agreement and send that to you next week.  Before I go on maternity leave, I will send down to you a binder with hard copies of all of our forms, along with the User's Guides to the ISDA and CSA.  We are still putting the finishing touches on the ISDA and CSA Schedules.  Could you also mention/remind the group that now Samantha Boyd's name should be added to all credit worksheets and Tana'a name taken off and that all day to day matters should be handled through the 2 Susan's and Samantha, as Tana is off the day to day stuff and working primarily on special projects? Thanks. Carol 
 Group: Mark has okay'ed having a going away lunch for Rod.  Looks like the week of June 26th works best for Rod.  Please e-mail Suzanne Adams by Monday of next week any days that week that do not work for you so we can pick a date. Thanks. Carol

 Paul: I have spoken with Dave Kistler about the form of CA that you sent to him. What we prefer to do is to use the form that was agreed to a year ago (a copy of which I have attached).  We can either (1) do a new CA based on this form or (2) since this CA does not expire for another year, do a side letter that provides that the term "Project" as used in this CA means both the project that is currently described and the new project that we are about to engagae in with you.  Please let me know your preference.  My number is 713-853-3989.  Carol 
 Don: You should contact Frank Davis at 713-853-7235.  He is out today but will be back on Monday. Carol 
 Leslie and Elizabeth: I should have sent this to you as well.    Could you please take a look at this form and let me know if it is okay with you?  Seems like there are more situations that are coming up where our counterparties are wanted to execute 1 Guaranty to cover all types of transactions and this is our attempt to develop a form that credit can use.   I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Russell: Just a reminder that I need to visit with you on matters relating to WPS, Equitable LLC and Global Companies LLC. CArol 
 Brant: Just a reminder that we need to discuss matters relating to Occidental (their proposed change to the MAC language) and Chautauqua Airlines.  Alos, with respect to Aquila/Utilicorp,  apparently they cannot have all of the online paperwork completed until next Tuesday.  They submitted a PA today but the guy that needs to authorize the sub-user accounts is not in the office until Tuesday.  The current plan would be for them to do that on Tuesday and then to make the switch from Aquila to Utilicorp effective next Wednesday.  I'll keep you posted but we still have not declared the Utilicorp ISDA effective. Carol 
 Please update me on where things stand.  We need to get this wrapped up before I go on maternity leave.  i'm hopeful that you are close and amybe done to 1 or 2 counterparties.  Thanks. Carol 
 Brad and John: We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification on the following points:  1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?  2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?  Carol 
 Suzanne: Marie is included.  Let's see how everyone else responds and hope that we can choose Mon, Tues or Wed.  I would prefer Mon or Tuesday because I see the doctor on Wed but let's see what works for everyone else.      Suzanne Adams 06/16/2000 05:05 PM 
 Sara: This is Greek to me.  Can you help? carol 
 Jeff: Just a few comments:  1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due to" need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.  2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it relates to the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier comment on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to Pelican .  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese explain why.  3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it say "the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.  What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

 Suzanne: Could you please follow up with janette on Monday regarding the conflicts waiver letter that I needed Mark to sign?  Thanks. Carol 
 Sara and Tana: FYI.  Please when you know it provide Suzanne with the headcount for the confirm/settlements program on May 5th and the global contracts program on May 24th and I will take care of the credit program on May 12th. Carol 
 Joya: I want to make sure that while I am out on leave that I can access my computer here.  I noticed that since Lotus Notes changed I cannot access my e-mail from my computer at home.  Would it be better for me to take a laptop home and is that possible?  Please advise. carol

 Suzanne: Can you order me some boxes?  I want to start going through my office and figuring out what to send home when I go on leave.  thanks.  Carol 
 Stacy: I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we need to do 2 things to the existing language:  1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is "Exposure".  2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.  We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the draft that we send out.  Carol 
 Sara: I'll go with whatever you and mark think is the right thing to do but O honestly have a hrad time justifying why tana or Susan Flynn should be recognized, particularly Susan Flynn.  I would much rather take Susan B. out to lunch rather than recognize all 3. Carol 
 Susan: Per my voice mail, here is the form of Energen Guaranty.  Please use this to create the Enron Guaranty. Carol

 Jeff: While I don't quite follow how terminating the Fixed taints the Floating since we have separated the 2, I am okay with this if this is how our commercial people understand how it works. Carol    "Eldredge, Jeff" <jeldredge@velaw.com> 06/18/2000 04:05 AM 
 Patricia: Frank forwarded to em your chnages to the ETA Agreement and here is our response:  1. I would like to discuss with you your chnages to Sections 1 and 2 (a).  2. We cannot accept the chnages that were made to section 2(b).  Any confidential info that you give us will be subject to the confidentiality provisions of the ETA.  3. We cannot accept the first deletion in Section 3(a) and with respect to the remaining deletions in Section 3(a) and the deletions in Section 3(d), I just want to make sure that we both understand how this will work in the vent that you want to trade a product on the website and there is no Master in place.

 David: FYI pursuant to my voice mail. Carol 
 Joe; Per our conversation, here is the scoop on Oneok.  By the way, Sara resolved the IPE Brent issues so we don't need to talk. Carol 
 Stephanie and Frank: Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my understanding of where things stand:  1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?  2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you know when that date is.  Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions. Carol 
 Joe: Did you ever contact them about the confirms that they sent to us?  Are they now signing our confirms?  Please advise as to what, if anything, I need to be doing on this.  Thanks. Carol

 Steve: I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the only open points relate to :  1. the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think about what I e-mailed to you?  2. DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the "materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.  3. Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation procedures.  4. DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I guess we still need to discuss the :defenses" language because as I indicated to you, I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.  I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.

 Jeff: As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will be ENA. Carol 
 Mike: I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves, our credit person, and we are okay with the concept except that we would like for the ratings trigger to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a failure to have an S&P rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we put in place a CSA, that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral threshold:  BB to BB+  $2,500,000 Below BB  Zero  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our form of Credit Support Annex?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

Can we do that at 10 and can you send to us before then an updated list of your outstanding work assignments? Thanks.  Carol 
 Tanya: Thanks for your message.  All El Paso wants to put in the LC form is language that states that the original LC will accompany any draw that is made for endorsement of the drawing amount and that it will be returned to the Beneficiary unless it is fully drawn upon.   I don't see any problem with this and while it may be unnecessary, if it males them feel better to have it, i would like to keep it in.  Are you okay with this?  Carol 
 Clement: We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks. carol

 Guys: Here is where I understand Bill came out on the 6.1(a) issue that we were discussing.

 Pablo: Weather derivatives are derivative transactions that we do with counterparties based on temperature chnages, rainfall amounts etc.  For example, a counterparty (i.e., a ski lift operator) may want us to agree to pay them within a certain seasonal period based on  the number of days that the temperature exceeds a certain level.  With respect to credit derivatives, these are again financial transactions that we may enter into with a counterparty where we may agree to pay them if an entity taht they have a relationship with goes bankrupt.

 Russell: Here is the Equitable CA.  I have bolded the section that I am concerned about. Carol  carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Russell: Based on my review of the 6/23 draft of ISDA Schedule here are my credit questions:  1. There is no Credit Support Provider for Equitable.  Should there be?  2. What should the cross default thresholds be and who should they apply to?  3. Are you satisfied with the Additional Termination Event?    I'm assuming that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense to take "future" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset sales made during the current year?  How will we know what assets sales are made?  Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report that we receive annually?  When will this calculation be done?  Are you satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?  4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report. Is that sufficient?  When should we get it?  Alos, whose financials do you want to receive?  5. In Part 5(c) - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts due and owing between the parties and does not include "affiliates".  6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even the GP.  For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of the transfer?  It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.  In addition, are you satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?  On asset sales, I think that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 limit currently works.  Alos, I think that all of these limitations in Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional termination Events.  Please call when ready to discuss.  Carol

 John: The Schedules look fine.  Just one minor chnage which I can maker.  In the form of LC, I'm deleting the words "Rider 1" at the bottm and in the last paragrpah of page 1, chnagung the word "receipts" to "receipt".  We will generate and send to you execution sets.  With respect to the Guaranty, we would prefer that you sue the fopm which I sent to you a few weeks ago.  Here it is.  This form is our updated form and matches up with the Enron Guaarnty that we are giving you.

 Clement: Thanks for your quick response.  As for me, I've got about 3 weeks to go and after this week, pretty much anything goes.  I feel great and am really excited and anxious.  In the meantime, I'm using my pregnancy as an excuse to get our counterparties to finalize our ISDA's and it appears to be working! Thanks for asking.

 Steve: Enron's general counsel has accepted the concept that we discussed last week in the Guaranty re setoff, defenses etc.  I will try to send you a revised Guaranty shortly. Carol 
 Karen: Here is our response to your e-mail comments:  1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to those other sections.  2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.  3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).  4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?  I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.  Carol 
 Scott: Thanks.  I'll let you know when a time has been sent out.  On your mark-up, could you please call Rick and let him know that we also need to take out "Approved Transaction Counterparty" from Section 6.1(a) as we have addressed that now in the Force Majeure definition.

 Luanne: Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the reference to "Goldman Group" to "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

 Teresa: As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about the maternity leave policy:  1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up at 100% pay.  2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and justifying sick leave pay at 90%  3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence, whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I still eligible?  I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my plans.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Leslie: Just 2 comments to this:  1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much as it is a relationship issue.  2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.

 Russell: Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. made  1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.  2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.  3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.  4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.  5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.  Carol 
 Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I will let you know if it is acceptable.  Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Steve: It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it separately.  Let me know what you think.

 Mary: Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.  Jeff, Stacy and Harry, Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the new form to credit.  Thanks for everyone's input.   Carol 
 HR confirmed that Stephanie is still interested and has not been hired by anyone else.  Please let me know if you feel we should contact her for purposes of indicating to her our interest in her and obtaining salary information from her.  Carol 
 Russell: Their attorney finally contacted me and we talked about the ESP rules.  She is going to do further research in light of the fact that for regulatory purposes Utilicorp, the GP, cannot furnish a Guaranty.  I alos mentioned to her that at the very least we would like to make Utilicorp a "Specified Entity" so that they would be part of the credit-related Events of Default in the ISDA Master.  As a general rule, we recommend in circumstances where the counterparty is an LP and you are relying on the GP's credit, making the GP a "Specified Entity" so that for example their bankruptcy would trigger an Event of Default.  Call me if you have any questions. carol 
 Mark and Leslie: Claudio wants to talk to someone about this weather/power online product that he is working on.    Enclosed is info on it.  Who should he be talking to about this?

 Mark and David: Here is the status of research our counsel in Mexico is doing re online issues. Carol 
 Russell: There are a number of factors that determine priority, one of them being exposure amounts.  I have asked David to prepare a chart for me before I spend alot of time pursuing counterparties and that is what I am waiting for.  I would really like to have this information within the next week so that before I go on maternity leave I can at least summarize what needs to be done.  Can someone else in credit give David the Exposure information so that David can finalize the chart with the other information that I have requested?  I am afraid that if we wait until you get back, I will be gone. Carol    Russell Diamond 06/30/2000 07:53 AM

 Tanya: Here are the credit related comments that we received from Quaker Oats' counsel:  1. They prefer Market Quotation instead of Loss.  This will obviously be a discussion point given the type of commodity that we anticipate. trading with them  2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.  3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.  4. They do not want the provisions of section 6(c) of the CSA to apply at any time.  5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to terminate and have a payment  obligation owing to us before we could draw.  6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.  7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.  Without this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,  terminate and then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.  To the extent that we were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts that they might owe us.  This is an interesting issue and one that I have not seen before.  8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.  Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?  Is this something I should try to push forward in the next week or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?  Carol 
 Jaime: Here is a message that I received from our counsel.

I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday? Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 Robert: I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of the credit comments:  1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.  I would like to talk to you about the second paragraph.  2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than Market Quotation.  3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.  In addition. our tax people are now advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.  4. NY is okay with governing law.  5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go with our language and really didn't see much difference in what you sent other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something?  6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.  How about 5?  7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.  We can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.  Does that work for you?  8. Insert 7 is okay.   9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,  10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.  11. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit posted collateral to LC's only.  12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor?  13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A except that we need Moody's because it is used in the LC language.  14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put "either the Issuer or X" and in 1(b) include your language as an alternative?  15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).  We would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.  16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in Section 2 of the Guaranty.  17. Inserts 10, 11 and 12 are okay.  18. In Section 6(c), I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the Payment Demand procedure.  19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.  20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot agree to Insert 13.  21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.  I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of Insert 9.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will not be in the office monday or tuesday.  Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to include the following language at the end of Part 6.

 Steve and/or Rhett: We are trying to finalize an ISDA with the above counterparty which is  a Bermuda company.  They made 1 tax comment to our Schedule.  Currently, they rep to us that Each payment received or to be received by them in connect with the Master Agreement will not be effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the US.  They want to add the following to this rep:  Each payment to be received by it in connection with the Master Agreement will be either foreign source income under the Code or portfolio interest within the meaning of Section 881(c) of the Code or gain derived from the cash settlement of an option.  Is this okay?  As my days are numbered here if there is any way that I could get some feedback on this this week that would be great so that at least I can respond to them.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Luanne: I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's.  Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Chris: I am not a power expert (Sara Shackleton in our group handles the power trades) and would feel better if Christina Yoder took a look at this.  I understand he will be back in tomorrow and I have left him a voice mail message about this.  With respect to the form of Proposal Letter, I would prefer that you use the form that I have attached.  With respect to the proposed Term Sheet, the paragraph before the "Corrections to Published Prices" paragraph refers to an Annex A which if this deal is confirmed under an ISDA would not be the correct reference.  Also,  in the disclaimer at the end, please change all references of "Williams" to "ENA."    Please call me if you have any questions.  If this cannot wait for Christian, perhaps Shari Stack could look at it.  Let me know what you want to do.

 Ann: I will do that.  Just to clarify, he will need to sign off on all of the changes, which I hope I can walk him through.  The only language that I am concerned about is what I have marked as "under review".  I will copy you on what i send to him as I will edit your draft to make my changes.  I will be leaving to go on maternity leave shortly (probably no later than July 14th) and if for some reason we don't conclude this, Mark Taylor will handle (713-853-7459)  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    "Love, Anne" <ALove@talisman-energy.com> 07/05/2000 03:54 PM 
 Mark and Sara: David Runnells has come up with a lawyer from A&K to help us out.  His name is Jason Peters and he is coming over at 3:30 on Monday to meet with us.

 Tana: As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my records in various stages of negotiation:  1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have been run by Dave.  2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run by Dave.  3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim.  4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March. Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.  5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave has not reviewed their comments or my response.  6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.  7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.  8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.  9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.   All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my directory under specproj/online.   Carol

 Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any comments.  Carol 
 Scott: Our commercial guys are in Philly today meeting with ACE to discuss an alternative online structure.  From what I know (which is very little at this point), because of the amount of time that it takes to implement the auction process online, our guys are looking into with ACE whether this product can be offerred pursuant the normal posting procedures that we use for most of our financial online derivative transactions.  Leslie and I are scheduled to meet with them tomorrow at Noon Houston time so if you are available and we can hook you in, let me know, otherwise one of us will catch up with you.  I would alos think that we could discuss the revised policy at that time since I don't think much will change if we go about it this way.

 Mark: I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the following in connection with my leave that you have approved:  1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.  2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence. Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.   3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should know more after next Wednesday.   Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.  Carol

 Dave: I expect to receive from our counsel in Mexico a memo addressing all of the online issues that we have asked them to address in the next day or so as I spoke with them yesterday about this.  I will need to review the memo with them and Mark Taylor to make sure that all of the issues have been adequately addressed and to determine if any changes need to be made to the documents. From my conversations with them, there don't appear to be any major issues other than the fact that we cannot offer "securities" to Mexican counterparties and they will define in the memo what products would be considered securities, but I want to see waht they put down in writing before we make any conclusions.  I or Mark will keep you posted.  Carol    David Forster@ENRON 07/06/2000 03:59 PM 
 Mark: Per my voice mail Carol 
 Jaime: when are you planning on sending this out?  I'm checking with Mark on this but I thought that we would wait until we had seen our counsel's memo before we would issue a press release or send these letters out.  Is that the plan? Given the ramifications of a press release, I want Mark's input on what it says and when it should be sent out. Carol    Jaime Williams@ENRON 07/06/2000 04:01 PM 
 Jaime: Thanks.  I spoke with Mark and he confirmed that we should do nothing until we have received and reviewed the memo from our counsel which hopefully we will get shortly and Mark and I will get on it right away.  Per your voice mail message, if we could include something in the cover letter to address our counsel's concern, that would be great.

 Russell: Here is a summary of the ownership chain of Global Companies LLC:  1. Its members are Global Petroleum Corp. ("GPC"), YPF Distribution Company ("YPF") and Montello Oil Corporation ("Montello").  From what they sent to us, I could not tell the ownership percentages.  2. The affairs of Global are managed by a "Board of Governors" who are selected by the members.  Specifically, GPC and Montello collectively get to choose 3 board members and YPF gets to choose 3 board members.  I your credit worksheet, you had specified as a "MAC" trigger if YPF, SA fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.  Is this the same entity as YPF Distribution Company?  Do you want this as a MAC or as an Additional Event of Default or Termination Event?  Carol

With respect to Project Margaux, please coordinate with Mark Evans in London to get closing sets of documents.   With respect to Raptor II, I will leav a message with Alicia Curry at V&E to send you the closing sets.  I will leave with you my closing binder on Raptor I.

 David: Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the following issue came up:  If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Alicia: I'm assuming that I will be gone when the closing sets for raptor II are sent out.  Could you please send one set to Susan Bailey, a legal assistant in our group, so we have one for the swap files?  Susan's number is 853-4737. Thanks.

 Mr. Davis: Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Susan and Samantha: This is a file that apparently Shari worked on and Susan Flynn gave to me.  I have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which then should be ready to sign.  There are some Guaranty issues that I need to take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.  Carol 
 Tana: I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.  Carol

 Zulie: I am teaching a junior achievement course to a third grade class at my son's school.  I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something akin to a "goodie bag" that they give out to kids.  Would I be eligible for this?  I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to ask.  My extension is 33989. Carol

 Tana: Here is where things stand on Engage:  1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000  2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the Engage Canada financial transactions.  I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.  Carol

 Tanya: When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in fact this Master will be assigned to New Power? Carol

 Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder."

I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.  3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign.  4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.  5.

Alos, I have made the chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity leave at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at 713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get this finalized.

 Suzanne: Thanks.  I just want to make sure that my vacation time gets paid at 100% before I go down to the 90% level.  Thanks for taking care of this.  As you can see, I now have access to my e-mail so when I'm not pumping, feeding, changing diapers, etc...  I acn be checking up on things!!!

 Suzanne: Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail. On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK? Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so. Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you have done.  Tell Ric I hope to see him at the club in a few weeks.

 Suzanne: Some of the 8 week sick pay will be paid at 100% (4 weeks I believe) and some at 90%.  Therefore, please enter my vacation time as vacation time so I get paid 100% and not 90%.  Thanks.

 Tanya: We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions for you:  1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.  2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?  3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?  4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?   Carol

 Ana: I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.  How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August. Sue is Charles' godmother.  Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol    Ampmstc@aol.com 07/10/00 05:18 PM

 Suzanne: Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to finish.  tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.  carol  ps - if anyone has some astros tickets for this weekend let me know as bill and arthur may want to go.

 Cindy: Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at falling asleep on his own.  How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.    Sue, How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.   Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and call or write me.  Love, Carol   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Tanya: I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to the "transfer" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee provides a satisfactory guaranty to us. Carol 
 Rod: Thanks for the info.  Our family doctor has recommended someone close by so we'll give him a try.  Hang in there on the moving details.  I know that things will settle down soon.  Things are great here.  Charles Eugene seems to be adjusting well and we are really enjoying him.  He'll be in his crib in a few weeks.  As for the swap group, yes they are thin but they appear to be hanging in there.  I spoke with Mark yesterday.  When I left, Sara was in London taking care of her mom who became very ill while ahe was over there. She is fine now and Sara is back but Mark pretty much had to handle things on his own for a few days.  He appears to have survived.  we just hired Susan Flynn's replacement so hopefully by the end of August the LA's will be back at full strength which will help out alot.  Take care and keep in touch.  You may be getting some e-mails from Mary Cook about some of my files which she has now inherited.

 Terry: Just wanted to let you know that our son, Charles Eugene, was born on July 12th.  He is absolutely beautiful and well worth the long wait and all of the time and effort that it took to have him.  After a prolonged stay in the hospital, we are both home now and doing really well.  I'm on cloud nine and I'm sure that all of this will hit me soon.  Hope you are doing well.  Take care.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Suzanne: Please send this to Scott Sefton and call the Bracewell person and tell them that he is now in charge of this matter.  I haven't had anything to do with this file since I joined the swap group.  Thanks.  Everything is fine.  Still on a hectic schedule but getting a little more sleep.  We take the baby to the pediatrician on Thursday for his first checkup and I go for mine on Friday.  I've started walking again and some very, very slow jogging (don't tell Bill this).  I feel really good and everything seems to be healing okay.  I've actually cooked a few meals!  I will try to call you in the next day or two.  We've been taking the baby out on short trips in the afternoon just to get out of the house.

 Dan: Thanks for the e-mail.  Things are going very well.  The hospital stay was a little long but once we both got home things got much better.  I miss the work routine but I'm really enjoying my time with both Charles and Arthur, and of course Bill.  I hope to be up and around in a week or so.  my recovery has been slow and steady but except for a lack of sleep, I feel great.  Hope to be running soon.  I'll be up for a visit in a few weeks.

 Suzanne: Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift. Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.  Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.  I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it? I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet (which I know you will).  As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.  Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by for a visit.
