 thoughts on the above:  1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that correct?  2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals?  3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.  Carol 
 David: Thanks.  Per my voice mail messgae, are you okay with giving Cinergy the right to terminate?  This apparently is there only issue.  Also, how do you want to handle future requests for termination rights if we can't geta counterparty to back down from their request?  Do you want me to check with you each time? Carol 
 Bob: As currently written with my changes, we will return any written confidential information.  In addition, to the extent that we prepare internal analyses, memos etc.  that contain confidential information, we usually do not want to give our work product to the other party.  Therefore, we agree to keep it subject to the terms of the CA or destroy it and that is what my Insert A says and that is why I deleted their language.  With respect to the term Representative, that should be defined to mean any director, officer, employee, counsel, representative and affiliate of any party as well as any affiliate's directors, officers, employees, counsel or representative.  Have you reviewed the description of Confidential Information, and in particular, clause (d) and are you comfortable with it.  Other than the reference to the Website, is there anything else that we should add as a description of what we are showing them?  Finally,  per Louise's e-mail, she doesn't want to agree to the no solicitation language until we contract with them.  Could you please communicate that to them? Carol 
 David: Grant has faxed to me Crestar's comments to the PA and ETA.  As I explained to Grant, some of them are legal and some of them, I think, will require input from you and perhaps can be resolved in a call to them.  I am going to have this delivered to you with my thoughts on some of the comments assuming that we couldn't talk them into accepting these docs as is.  Please let me know when convenient how best to proceed. carol 
 Jim: We have finally devised a procedure for handling termination rights.  I will amend the ETA amendment letter and send it to you.  We have a new procedure in place that requires me to get commercial approval for all amendments so I first will need to run this by the head of the Online group but will send it to you right after I receive that approval.  Sorry for the delay. carol 
 David: Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt? Carol 
 Richard: Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty who had requested in their arbitration language that only monetary damages are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.  carol 
 Susan: Thanks for the update.  Looks like we are getting close.  Let's go ahead and prepare an agreement for Morgan.  Alos, on Coral, are they ready to sign? Carol

 Mr. May: I am working with Lisa Mellencamp on this matter and I just wanted to let you know that we will be sending you sometime tomorrow a completed draft of the amendment to the financial derivative and physical agreements that we want the Court to approve.  The purpose of the amendment is to expand our setoff rights and to add additional events of default/termination events that relate to events that may occur during the bankruptcy proceeding.  We will be out of the office the rest of the week at our legal conference but you can leave me or Lisa a voice mail message with any comments or questions that you may have.  My number is 713-853-3989. Enclosed is a preliminary draft that just deals with the financial derivative agreement.  Another lawyer in our group is handling the physical agreement amendments.

 Ed: We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit points with them:  1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.  2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.  3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.  4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses (ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic creditworthiness test.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Janet: Enclosed is some sample surety bond language that we have used along with a surety bond form.  I have reviewed your form and think that we can use it with some minor modifications. The enclosed provisions will need to be modified to fit our situation and taht is part of what I want to discuss at our meeting next week so we can all understand how the bond gets issued, what it covers and how it gets triggered.

 Rod and Paul: I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an answer this morning.  Rod, If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there other credit issues that need to be considered?  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Rod: Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:  1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold  2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.  3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an Event of Default occurs.  4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts   With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff rights.

 Keith: As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:  1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.  2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed. Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements.  3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.  4. We prefer the Loss method.  5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the "materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for posting an LC.  6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a "Specified Entity".  We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of "Specified Transaction" to include physical transactions.  7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral.  8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).  9. We need to discuss the arbitration language.  10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate.  11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity Definitions Supplement?  12. In the "Recording" section we would like to add the phrase "To the extent permitted by applicable law" at the beginning of the last sentence.  13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.  14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral.  15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts.  16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.  I look forward to hearing from you.
