might not like me.  that is hard to belive though. 
 just chill girl. 
 it isn't that big of a deal.  why don't you just relax about the whole thing. 
 no.  you are so gullable. 
 ok 
 yeah.  i think we are hitting the strip clubs. 
 i am ready to go tonight.  you going out? 
 where didn't i go? 
 no really.  it was a blast.  little tired but i can rally for tonight. 
 i didn't even go home 
 how are we doing on our contest? 
 how was mitch's bday? 
 we will see what the line is.  either you will take it or you wont.  don't try to negotiate. 
 i don't like double standards being put on me.  i am the only one that can do double standards. 
 don't be fucking stupid.  i wouldn't do it straight up when i could get points. 
 our going out contest.  are we starting that tonight or do you concede?  i don't know why she thinks i am high maintanence. 
 i just heard that before and tori was joking w/ me about that.  i don't get it.  are we starting our contest tonight? 
 do you think i am high maintanence? 
 i dont think you look like her anymore.  my judgement was off that day.  i was around paint fumes looking at houses. 
 tori over here thinks bonnie is a hottie. 
 just did.  let me know what she says. 
 oh.   that is different than your first response. quite different.  i am going to email your friend jen and see what she thinks. 
 i didn't get thrown out of a casino.  i had to leave this bar b/c they over charged us by $300 so i argued w/ the manager and he said i had to leave.  i was pissed, but i didn't get physically removed or anything.  these guys at this club tried to rip us off and i was pissed.   i didn't out do my birthday either.  we drank a lot but it was over long periods of time.  it wasn't like on my birthday when we just slammed everything as fast as we could. 
 your mom didn't say she was ugly.  stop lying.  i think that girl is hot so i don't care. 
 i am all hot and bothered. 
 oh my god!  i am all worked up here at work.  i am going to find you a hottie right now. 
 does that mean you would do it even if i didn't win $80million 
 i thought it was.  i think that girl is hot.  if i won $80million that is the girl i want you to hook up with. 
 whatever.  i try to be nice and pay you a compliment and you turn it on me.  i guess i will just never compliment you again. 
 those photos are all stretched out.  i can't believe you don't think she is pretty 
 whatever.  i think you are messing around and you probably love the comparisson. 
 http://www.bonniebernstein.freeservers.com/  this is the site and she doesn't look like a man.  danm it. 
 i just did that and she is not in there.  she does not look like a man.  she is a hottie. 
 did you talk to her recently or something?  i have been out of time a lot this month.  i went to vegas this weekend and i feel like shit now.  i had fun with her, but i really didn't hear too much from her so i  just took it as an indication. 
 are you sure you are looking at the correct one b/c i don't see her on yahoo.  i think you are lying b/c she is not gross. 
 where did you look her up?  i dont know what you are talking about b/c she is skinny and pretty. 
 she isn't gross .  she is hot.  you need to see her on tv.  like i said, that is not a great pic. 
 http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/chat/2000/cbs/bernstein112000.htm  this is a photo of the girl i think you look like but it isn't really a good pic. 
 you know i can't wait to see you 
 if you act enthusiastic(sp?) then you'll be enthusiastic(sp?)! 
 good.  that is what i like to hear. 
 what do you mean you guess? 
 7:30-8.  how does that sound? 
 what time you coming over 
 did you get a stripper? 
 i thought your first offer sucked. 
 i cannot make it.  my parents will be in town this weekend. 
 i am not going to do that.  my job is too good here.  i want to live in denver, but i want the job i have here.  i can go there later.  hopefully i will get paid and it will work out. 
 not much.  i am trying to sell my house so i have been looking for a new house recently.  there are some cool things that i have found.  i have been going out a little, but not like we did in the beginning of the year.  that was fun.  when i move i will throw a big party and we can start it up again. 
 your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english.  i was wondering why you didn't respond.  jury duty sucks huh?  have you been going out at all? 
 times are getting tight for me.  i really liked that house i saw yesterday.  i figure since you are not spending money on a dog you can spend it on me. 
 that is working out perfect for you 
 if you win lets go to applebys and if i win lets go to redwood grill. 
 i don't think so.  sometimes the sun shines on a dogs ass but i don't see that happening again. 
 here is our bet on cu/a&m game this summer.  i have cu -8.  we can think of a dinner later. 
 that is nasty 
 you probably didn't even see it 
 what game 
 i hope he doesn't publish this and respond to it today. 
 ditto 
 that is all we can do is attack his mom.  i am all for it.  she should be ashamed of producing such a jackass. 
 are you leaving in 15 min or something?   i think i am out of here.  i need a haircut. 
 i am sure they are.  houston won't be too affected b/c most of the layoffs affect satelite offices.  economy should be good here. 
 b/c i wanted to read a story freak 
 someone should tear him a new one, but it is hard to argue any of his points 
 she is waiting to see if she can get financing. 
 i got a few of them.  i have a rash now in my lap. 
 i am going to stay in.  i need to find a house. 
 i am too tired to type 
 i'm bored.  tell me a story. 
 alright.  talk to you later. 
 yeah 
 probablyl gonna just kick it 
 you know, whatever.  i will let you know later.  what are you doing tonight. 
 i can think of a few things 
 sad but true. 
 real sweet.  you have a stone heart. 
 you should see the rash 
 um, i don't remember that. 
 i am tired b/c i kept waking up with no covers and my butt was hanging off the bed. i looked at you and you were covered up to your neck with the covers in the middle of the bed.  you look like you slept well. 
 i am tired.  your dog kept me up all night. 
 math is universal.  me =/ jerk 
 yeah.  it is math. 
 me > dog 
 i guess i do but i wouldn't be suprised either way.  you can show me it this weekend. 
 how many ounces does that little runt bailey weigh? 
 now i know you are lying.  yesterday the lie was about a poodle.  why can't you just be honest with me?  the lies and deceit hurt me erin. 
 what color is your poodle 
 i felt fine.  i was just tired but i didn't feel bad.  my golf game sucks but that is b/c i have a new golf swing after my lesson a couple of weeks ago.  this swing is going to take me  to the next level.  i think if trading doesn't work out i will have something to fall back on. 
 it isn't oozing, just itching.  it was worth every penny.  i think this hooker really liked me. 
 sweet.  you can start by picking up the tab at capital grill. 
 both 
 sorry man.  can't make it.  i have a dinner at cafe annie's tonight 
 pay more than i want.  so from now on you need to pay when we go out. 
 i havent looked anymore.  i will look this weekend.   i think i need to pay more than i want to.  how old is your dog? 
 i don't believe you b/c i don't think you would not have had time to get it yesterday when you said you had it 
 stop lying 
 this situation reminds me of kids with imaginary friends.  what is your imaginary friend's name? 
 did you get any sleep last night with your new dog?  when do i get to see this alleged dog? you probably got one of those robotic dogs.  what is its name? 
 you didn't buy a dog.  i want to see the receipt. 
 thanks.  i heard boone was in rare form though.  i am dead tired right now. 
 why?  don't you think you would lose that bet? 
 lets bet your dinner on it right now.  i think i might need to pay up to get a house 
 you did not 
 did you get a lil' chihuahua?  i hate those things. 
 i couldnt see it b/c it was surrounded by a wooden fence.  i know you didn't get a dog.  unless you took one of your 2 hour breaks before lunch. 
 i think that all they do is bark and freak out.  they aren't good dogs.  they aren't friendly.  and i am not angry. 
 look, damn it, they have all the personality in the world and they are not that big.  i don't think you know what a cockerspaniel is. 
 yeah i had one.   her name was mandy and she was the sweetest dog and my dad has one currently and the dog isnt retarded.  all dogs are dumb.  they are called dumb friends b/c they don't speak. 
 your retarded.  i used to have one.  they are great dogs. 
 i have to go to butt-fucking mississippi.  i am not looking foward to that but don't tell val.  the following weekend i will be ready to rock. 
 i think they are all bark and no bite.  i think they could get their asses kicked by cats.  they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk.  you should get a cockerspaniel. 
 are you kidding?  why would you want a chihuahua?  those dogs aren't even friendly.  do you think they are cool b/c of the taco bell dog? 
 it depends what type you get.  if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like that dog.  if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place.  those little furry dogs act like cats. 
 only if i have a bad day.  if i have a bad day will you let me come over and kick it? 
 when are you getting your dog dog? 
 lisa lisa-  what have you been up to?  you still moving to india or is your buddy moving back here. 
 could you please remove me from this distribution 
 what is the website address? 
 great.  way to go.  you will lose this weekend. 
 dietz's bachelor party was ok.  we did the same thing that we did at val's.  i am not going to the tenn game.  i might go to the florida game. 
 i don't know but i don't want to make it.  i just want to stay home. 
 i got home fine.  what was the name of that book you told me about?  was it the 4th deminsion? 
 congrats tom tom.  you can reach me at: 1212 fairview #A houston  77006 
 i just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office.  i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career.  although this year has been up and down, i am enjoying my role on the desk.  i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up.  the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver.  we can talk more about it if you would like on monday. 
 boudreaux-  what's up?  are you going to the tenn game? 
 i am not sure if i am moving or not.   i wont know until the beginning of the year.  i am back and forth on the decision.  i am glad your sis is ok.  i did get a room for 160.  i am sure i will split it with some of those guys. 
 around 4-5pm 
 good job mcfly! 
 7138258410.  how did you drop your phone in water?

 weather looks like this:  hi 69  lo 42 
 does anyone have that email where that ut dude gets all drunk?  i need to read it for inspiration. 
 oops i did it again 
 we will definately go party.  i went to the game and it sucked.  so your test is this weekend or the following?  sat there is a big party at garden in the heights. 
 what time are you going to get into town? 
 i am going to watch lsu sat and then go to that party at garden in the heights.  should be fun. let me know what is going on for your party celebration when you finish. 
 nothing happened with either.  so what is up with the divorced girl?  do you know her?

 the enron stock is down again.  13 days in a row. 
 13 days straight.  it is trading just over $11. 
 it is going to zero 
 i might go out.  i don't think that i am dressing up.  are you going out?  i would be up for going out, but i have nothing to dress up in. 
 i don't want to be a soilder during the war.  where are you going if you go out?  sierra?  let me knwo if you decide to go out b/c i think it would be a fun night. 
 the only thing at la strada is a bunch of nancy boys.  are your friends trying to meet gay guys or are they gay? 
 that is probably what i will end up doing.  i need to find some really nice smelling oil though. 
 what happened to the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again this year? 
 does that make a nice scent when baby oil and lotion are mixed?  i am first going to rub fake tan all over and then grease up.  i am just going to wear my new thong and my new gold bracelet.  i am going to look awesome when i am dancing.  i don't know what you should be.  i think you can do better than gi jane though.  you could be an umpalumpa for willy wonka.  everyone loves those little guys. 
 anyone going out for halloween tonight? 
 potentially 
 i want to come over and meet some milfs also. 
 step up and go out like a man.  stop crying like a lil' bitch.   sierra is gonna be packed with girls dressed like lil hookers.  go home, nap and then be ready to go by 8:30-9. 
 call me at home if you go out.  i will be home around 7ish. 
 i didn't get your email in time.  my number is 713-807-1699h and 713-825-8410c.  we went to sierra and it sucked.  total banana farm. 
 i dressed up as a cow with utters and everything.  i walked into sierra and there were only a few people dressed up.  it was so emabarrassing. 
 saturday i am going to woodrows to watch the game and then sat night we are going to the garden in the heights party. 
 good to hear from you.  looks like you got out at the right time.  ene is a sinking ship.  your boy fastow and skilling have sunk it.  are they making you work 100 hour weeks yet? 
 we might go get some food and spirits after work if you are interested.  i am going to butt-fuck mississippi for val's wedding.  i will be in town the rest of the month so i am ready to start tearing up houston again.  let me know if you are up for drinks after work. 
 i am tired.  you snore. 
 you guys want to watch the game at woodrows tomorrow?  there will be some girls there and then we can get them to meet up with us at that garden in the heights party later that night.  plus we can be outside watching it. 
 that isn't snoring, that is the sound of my teeth chattering b/c i have no covers. 
 you love it when i come over.  i satisfy your appetitie for lovin. 
 i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out. 
 you don't know what that means?  where did you grow up? india? 
 them just jokes 
 i just went to dinner.  let me know about thurs.  good luck on the test.

 i might go.  depends on this week.

 fat ass 
 there is a band?  what is going on this weekend? 
 just kidding 
 calling you a fat ass.  i am serious about which restaurant is better. 
 denver defense sucks 
 it is tough to
