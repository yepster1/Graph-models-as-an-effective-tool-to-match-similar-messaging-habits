t him all loaded and send him out on the strip naked. 
 i already read that shit 
 is this safe to open 
 is that it? 
 i think sept 6-9.  i am coming to denver in either may or july so we will iron out the final details then.  i will get the entertainment lined up for us.  i am going to vegas in two weeks and i will scout for some other shit to do. 
 i don't think they do that.  you don't want to pay someone to do that shit for you.  did your house really burn down? 
 it was no trouble.  let me know if you need anything else. 
 what about the angry dragon or the houdini? 
 i love the houdini and angry dragon. 
 you can borrow it whenever.  are you in town this weekend? 
 nothing going on here.  i went to new orleans this weekend for a bachelor party.  i am still dead.  so phoenix was nice?  i had a massage in cayman and i thought it was the best thing.  i couldn't figure out why a spa would be a good vacation until i had my massage.  give me a call when you get a chance. i will be home tonight. 
 you just sent a reply to all to everyone at enron. 
 nope 
 i need to book a jan trip to new orleans. 
 you guys win one wild card game and all of the sudden the saints are superbowl contenders. 
 no.  you are really on there. 
 we have improved our defense and our starting qb, who is better than yours, was out.  plus we will have two more stud rb's back and some new defensive personnel. 
 are you still partying tonight?  i think i am going to stay in, but i am definately up for going out tomorrow night. 
 i would love to play the saints.  as i recall we ran right through that great defense. 
 it was someone who looked like him who was acting as him.  his dad had him shipped away so he wouldn't ruin his chance at becoming the president.  i love that book except that one chapter.  i thought the book was hilarious. 
 will do.  thanks for sending these.  i appreciate it. 
 is everyone still up for going out tonight?  i am going to party like a rock star tonight.  let's hit downtown.  we don't have to try that place the drink.  how about silante's or something. 
 i think you need to do some bartender training tonight. 
 from indiana jones when the chinese kid says "no time for love dr. jones" 
 that is gonna be me this weekend 
 there is an offer to join a golf club called the houston oaks for $145/mo. there are 36 holes.  i heard it is a good couse.  it is up near 290 and hwy 6.  the only thing you pay for is a cart.  sounds like a good deal.  i heard it is a nice course.  i am thinking of getting in if anyone else is interested.  let me know today what you think. 
 the website is houstonoaksgolfclub.com.  it doesn't look that great online. check it out or ask anyone if they have played there. 
 this place is like a 45 minute drive so i am out. 
  this is a funny video.  hopefully you can open it up.  i have some other good stuff also.  are you going to go out tonight?  i think i am heading to silantes.  send me some funny stuff and i will give you a call later.  - FingerPig.avi 
 the real victor was the one in europe not the law student.  the law student was the replacement victor.  that is the guy they got to act as victor so he wouldn't ruin his dad's chances at pres.  great book.  what is going on for easter? 
 check out chad's name in this thing 
 i almost sent you that one.  that is hilarious.  that is what i dressed up as one year for halloween. 
 look harder.  it is a funny picture.  i think you had a 4.7 avg. 
 no thanks.  what aabout the happy hour with the hottie? 
 the law student was the replacement b/c the real one was such a fuck up. sorry i didn't call you guys back last  night.  i didn't get home until 8 and the sopranos was on. 
 i will be in vegas.  send her my regards. 
 i felt fine.  i was just tired but i didn't feel bad.  my golf game sucks but that is b/c i have a new golf swing after my lesson a couple of weeks ago. this swing is going to take me  to the next level.  i think if trading doesn't work out i will have something to fall back on. 
 you didn't think that was funny?  do i need to explain that one? 
 that was great.  that is as funny as i get. 
 you weren't on there. if you were i am sure you would be a 10. 
 congrats.  that is good news.  what else is going on. 
 ditto.  work is it.  i am going to vegas this weekend, so i got that going for me. 
 why not?  you don't like those things?  you get penis straws and everything. 
 i am going with work.  another boondoggle. 
 i am at the venitian.  i am going to stay in the rainman suite.  should be a good time.  i can load up and get some hookers and just have an old fashioned good time.  it is a good stress relief. 
 i am just kidding.  i wouldn't ever pay for it.  anyway i am going with people from work so it woulnd't look to good if i was bringing hookers into my room. 
 just b/c i am saving myself doesn't mean you need to attack me. 
 i heard your nickname in highschool was the "virgin surgeon" 
 did you take his v-card?  i don't think i ever dated one.  i like my women fast. 
 why are you staying with her parents?  won't that kill some of your fun?  how good was the deal? 
 got to work dude 
 oh yeah.  he doesn't sound like a lot of fun - if you catch my drift.  what are you guys doing for the bachelorette party?  if you need entertainment i might be for hire.  i would totally give those chicks a thrill. 
 if i could get a guaranteed contract plus tips i would skip the trip. remember how great my legs would look dancing all over the chicks. 
 i thought that you said you were sharing a suite with them.  thanks for the pics. 
 1400 smith st. houston, tx 77002-7361 
 i have to hold off until vegas.  my liver is sore from this past weekend.  i have to go home and nurse it at night. 
 shooters. 
 are you going out tonight or something?  i think chad has a good opp in austin.  now i have somewhere to stay when i go to austin every other weekend.  i did have a good date the other night.  i haven't spoke with her since so i don't know if i am going out with her or not tonight. 
 for easter i just stayed in town and golfed all weekend?  what did you do? did you go to central and regulate some punks.  what are you doing this weekend?  i am going to vegas.  i haven't been home at all this month except for last weekend.  i have to go to buttfuck mississippi next weekend for a wedding. 
 val is getting married there.  his fiance, celeste, is from there. mississippi is so cool. 
 i got your jacket from bass 
 means you got a lot of ammo 
 nevermind 
 i haven't watched them at all.  every time i try to watch hockey they are not on.   i am gonna watch their next series.  who are they gonna play? 
 i don't remember the bet 
 are you hurting this morning?  my lifestyle has to change within the next 5 years or i will be dead. 
 i feel like a champ today 
 your past few months have been just as bad.  at least i didn't close uropa b/c i was puking in the bathroom. 
 is your dad ok?  what is hines?  is that a development firm?  i just didn't call her last night.  you can't call them the next night.  that looks pathetic if you do.  this way she can sit around and think about me for a day.  she is a cool chick.  nice, cute sorority chick.  well let me know if you go out. 
 i don't remember half of that night, but i do remember you in the bathroom. sierra is fun on wednesdays isn't it? 
 by the way, my abs kill from my rigorous workout yesterday. 
 who is better for the avs to play?  what has been going on in denver? 
 should be 7.20. 
 i hate notre dame.  tim, i need to get down to your office today. 
 maybe i will come home the 16th of may.  let me see and i will get back to you. 
 i can't come the last week b/c of work.  that is when prices get set for next month gas.  it is a very busy week and there is no way for me to get out of it.  when are grandma and grandpa coming? 
 are you on crutches 
 i don't understand that last email 
 if it is real estate development i would like to look into it.  let me know. i want to see what type of work it is. 
 i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope that helps you out. 
 it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut up nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here? but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.   MFL 
 nope.  we talked a couple of times and tenatively planned to go out, but last time i called she didn't call back.  she sounded like she has a situation w/ her ex or she just might not like me.  that is hard to belive though. 
 how was mitch's bday? 
 i didn't get thrown out of a casino.  i had to leave this bar b/c they over charged us by $300 so i argued w/ the manager and he said i had to leave.  i was pissed, but i didn't get physically removed or anything.  these guys at this club tried to rip us off and i was pissed.   i didn't out do my birthday either.  we drank a lot but it was over long periods of time.  it wasn't like on my birthday when we just slammed everything as fast as we could. 
 did you talk to her recently or something?  i have been out of time a lot this month.  i went to vegas this weekend and i feel like shit now.  i had fun with her, but i really didn't hear too much from her so i  just took it as an indication. 
 did you get a stripper? 
 that is nasty 
 i got a few of them.  i have a rash now in my lap. 
 you should see the rash 
 ho w have you been?  i haven't been up to much just going out and stuff.  are you going home for the holidays?  i am heading to denver this weekend and will be there through next week.  what are you doing over new years? 
 it isn't oozing, just itching.  it was worth every penny.  i think this hooker really liked me. 
 thanks.  i heard boone was in rare form though.  i am dead tired right now. 
 i have to go to butt-fucking mississippi.  i am not looking foward to that but don't tell val.  the following weekend i will be ready to rock. 
 i don't know but i don't want to make it.  i just want to stay home. 
 tim should have it.  so are you getting nervous.  vegas rocked.  what time does the wedding start and how long of a drive is it?  i bet you're nervous. let me know if we need to keep  a car running out front. 
 i am glad to hear it.  it is  ok, it isn't like i need the money or anything.  how was your date? 
 did you get her to sign a service contract?  i won about $700 
 thanks for that email.  i just opened it and everyone say that shoot across all 4 screens of mine.  i will talk to you later b/c i have to go up to hr now. 
 no. i like the rockets a lot, but not as much as the nuggets.  i will be home on fri. 
 oops i did it again 
 what time are you going to get into town? 
 what happened to the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again this year? 
 we might go get some food and spirits after work if you are interested.  i am going to butt-fuck mississippi for val's wedding.  i will be in town the rest of the month so i am ready to start tearing up houston again.  let me know if you are up for drinks after work. 
 just call me on my cell phone.  i am going to happy hour after work to eat and drink. 
 there is a band?  what is going on this weekend? 
 let me know when you want to go out.  i can go out any night. 
 did they look lazy?  they always seem over-confident. 
 sounds fun.  i think i am going to go out there at lunch and get some dancing in. 
 i am heading to new orleans for new years.  chad actually went home for the holidays and is moving to austin at the beginning of the year for a govt rotation for enron. 
 i say we go to tealas and sit on the porch. 
 what is your cell number again 
 you didn't send the number.  just call me on mine @ 7138258410.  i am thinking tealas and sitting out on the porch. 
 that is disgusting.  watch for me i will be the one dancing like a maniac. 
 430 is good 
 what are you going to dc for? 
 do you know those girls? 
 i was going to come home this weekend if you knew them.  we would have to set up a service contract with those chicks. 
 you just know b/c you saw the movie.   didn't you ever see indiana jones? 
 i will try to talk with mike later this week.  is he in development or accounting?  thanks for calling him for me. 
 what is shawn's cell phone number?  he was supposed to stay at my place last night and he didn't show up. 
 yeah baby.  i was there two weeks ago and there were hotties everywhere.  i am going to come home in the early part of july and we will figure out the final details. 
 i found a bunch of tickets to fargo.  most run through minneapolis.  the cheapest is $432.  the earliest arrives at 12:30 and they have one at 2, 3, 5.  let me know what you guys have and i will coordinate the times accordingly. 
 those were pretty good.  how is everything in phoenix?  it looks hot. 
 it was supposed to have some pics 
 i am going to try to rent out my place and get another hopefully. 
 did you like the blond with the white sweater? 
 shawn is in town tonight and wants to get a bite to eat if you are up for it. 
 i will let you know.  i need to run after work. 
 email me back or just give me a call tonight. 
 what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was dc?  i heard that place is a blast. 
 i heard dc is fun.  i don't care what we do.  we were talking about going to boone's sat and hang out on his porch and drink before we go out.  i think he has a patio in his backyard. 
 what is it.  i got to know.  i need some new chicks.  i need the weekend. today totally sucks.  what are some good books to read? 
 no, but i saw that they won tonight.  it was close.  is sakic going to be ok? 
 i thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next morning when you both woke up. 
 this is for mom  i just want some clothes from polo.  or some colonge from polo - called polo sport.  what do you want? 
 i bought my ticket.  i arrive on that saturday @ 12:20pm.  i will email grandma. 
 hey grandma.  how is it going?  i just purchased my ticket for grand forks today.   i get in on saturday the 9th @ 12:20pm.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  love matt 
 what is grandma's email address? 
 i just ordered my ticket about 5 minutes ago.  i arrive in fargo on the 9th at 12:20 pm.  the ticket was $430.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone. i think it will be fun.  i am going to bring my clubs.  i have a new golf swing after a lesson i took a few weeks ago.  hope all is well.  thanks for picking up the bill for my ticket.  i really appreciate it.  love matt 
 i hope this isn't a pic of a naked old man again.  what has been going on?  i haven't heard from you in a while. 
 you didn't have fun at the small town wedding?    i had to go to one in mississippi this weekend.  it was actually fun.   vegas was two weekends ago.  that was a blast.  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star that weekend.  where are you moving?  maybe we can get drinks or something this week. 
 did they look good or lucky to win?  how is roy playing? 
 you said the line worked well and when i first started reading that i was like "hey now!".  you never know.  you could be a wild woman on vacation if you never have to see those people again. 
 why would you shoot yourself?  chicks go home with guys all the time. 
 how long do you have your lease at midtown? 
 how was your wedding? 
 i went to val's wedding.  it was a blast.  how did a wedding get busted by the cops?  what type of people went to this thing? 
 next week is good for me.  let 's just go get a drink after work or something.  who is your new roommate going to be? that sucks you have to waste a saturday moving. 
 this is still my email.  what is going on?  how is your business doing? 
 i think i met a few of your friends that night, but i don't remember who is who.  it seems like such a long time ago. any time is good for me next week. let's get together on tuesday?  let me know if that is good for you. 
 nice.  i knew that would be a better choice.  saturday night is on dog.  we are going to golf sat also if you are in.  let me know.  tee time is at 11. 
 745 sucks.  we will hit it sat night. 
 that was a mistake.  i don't know what i was thinking.  i need to stay home. 
 i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work. the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will try to call you and grandma this weekend.  matt 
 you staying warm up there?  looks like the wind chill is sub 30.  what do you and billie have planned for the holidays?  i am heading home on friday.  i am looking foward to getting home.  hopefully the weather wont be too cold. well i just wanted to say hello.  talk to you soon.  matt 
 he went home already.  we went to dinner mon & tues.  i am just going to chill this week and party on saturday, maybe even friday a little.  are you going out tomorrow? 
 enron would probably do something like this, but i think you need to contact that charity group.  they might already have a team.  it is good to see that you are such a philanthropist. 
 you going to golf or go play ultimate dork frisbee? 
 i have a tee time for sat @ 11.  let me know if you think you can play today.  the course is sienna plantation. 
 saturday is definately on.  fri i am up for whatever.  maybe happy hour and turn in before 2am for once. 
 Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect New Orleans Saints team. The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.  He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.  Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia. In one corner of the screen, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200 yards away --ka-boom!  "I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself. "He has the perfect arm!" So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans and teaches him the great game of football, and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl for the first time in history.  The young Bosnian is "canonized" as the Great Hero of football, and when Haslett asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to call his mother. "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl." "I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says. "You deserted us.  You are not my son." "I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads. "I just won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans." "No, let me tell you," the mother retorts. "At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday, and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight." The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says " ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to New Orleans."

 he is a winner.  kansas might turn into a 6 win a year program with cooper there. 
 yeah.  i think they will go to the rose bowl. 
 look for some gifts i sent home for lori, mckenna and grandma.  they should get there before friday.  if not let me know.  i got mckenna something from etoys and i heard they are having some problems.  their stock dropped to $0.28 yesterday from $82 last year so i don't know if they even care anymore.  see you this weekend. 
 the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot. 
 rohan davey 
 you better be able to golf tomorrow. 
 you obviously haven't seen my new swing.  you need to be on your best game to take my title. 
 totally 
 i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating them up after you threw up for 2 hours 
 all i know is we can never go back to teala's.  i don't want to get banned at front porch also SUSAN! 
 especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter 
 susan forgot to reply to all.  i think this was directed at you bass.   susan said: why the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself. 
 tell grandma i can't wait to hear her sing. 
 what about when he was gargaling puke trying to say " i am a trader at enron" 
 i think we should wait in line at the grasshopper next time so we don't waste our night.  we will know for next weekend. 
 what is up with the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again? 
 how was moving this weekend?  did you still want to get a drink after work tomorrow? 
 this is their last hope 
 how was happy hour?  i was golfing when you called and i didn't get the message until late. 
 if they don't win i read that they are going to break up the team 
 they have to be worried about you in ebs if you come in to work hung over on mondays 
 it is a good work out for you to move up 3 flights of stairs.  did you move it all yourself or pay someone to do it?   mi luna is good for me tomorrow. i love their ritas.  how about we go around 7.  i can pick you up or just meet you there if you are going straight from work. 
 we have diff # for jp.  as of 12/17 we have a bal of 11.346 in jp. 
 6:30 is fine with me.  i will meet you at the bar. 
 have you guys reserved a room for caymen yet?   i heard the comfort suites is where everyone is staying.  let me know if you guys just want to load everyone up in one room like back in high school. 
 comfort suites is like $800 total for 4 nights.  cheap as it gets down there.  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money.  only condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself. 
 i think they sell tickets for that dude's concert at the hollywood food store around the corner from my house. 
 that actually works out better for me.  i will meet you at mi luna at 7. that is the place in the village correct? 
 that is right.  i was looking at our operations group numbers which are incorrect. 
 i think they have two rooms with two double beds in each.  jen knows the details, but i heard we need to make reservations within the next week. 
 7:30 is good. 
 let me know what is up after you speak with her 
 did you call my cell last night? 
 he is a mo 
 i don't have it, but shoot him an email and he will give you a call. 
 i spoke with him this weekend and the place he mentioned was comfort suites. it would be $200/each for the whole week if 4 were in a room.  a condo would most likely be more expensive. 
 jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party. 
 we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.16. 
 hell yeah dog!  they betta be ready to get up on deez nuts. 
 oy vey 
 i was going to talk about all the dope he used to do and how he used to wear make up in middle school.

 thanks for the thank you note  asshole 
 i heard there are a lot of hot cougars at changs 
 remember that shirley sent this to me.  it is funny but gross. 
 how was hawaii dog?  did you leave the room? 
 are you guys going to send something special?  how about some stripper's panties from the bachelor party?  any news on caymen rooms?
