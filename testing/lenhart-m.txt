s your test.  don't lie. 
 happy belated birthday.  i will try to call tonight.  i was playing golf and didn't get home until 9 last night and went to bed. 
 yeah. don't mess with texas.  i didn't know you called. 
 $50.  not much for a shooter like me.  i will probably win it tonight at liars poker. 
 sure 
 you don't think the saints will make the playoffs now?  just this past weekend you were telling me that your in depth analysis led you to conclude a playoff berth for the saints.  you don't want to back up those statements after the saints preseason opener?  it sounds like every saint fan in august: predicting the playoffs in august and wearing a paperbag on your head by week 5. 
 you spelled sholes wrong. 
 worked good.  i downloaded a few songs from scour.com into your network. they are under c:\program files\napster\music. 
 are you going to buy or just cheer it on? 
 did you change your number?  i called once left a message.  there wasn't a greeting on the machine so i don't know if you got it or not.  i will be in town tues afternoon and i leave thurs afternoon next week.  hopefully we can get together for lunch or breakfast. 
 men's club 
 what city is that area code from? 
 actually i am staying at the adam's mark hotel downtown.  i will definately be able to see you guys at least once.  i am not sure what the schedule is so i will just play it by ear.  i wish i was coming in for the weekend, but the tickets were twice as much and they don't want to pay for my vacation.  call me tonight & i will let you know details. 
 you're hurting my feelings. 
 rocked 
 going out this weekend?  golf maybe tomorrow. 
 give me a call.  i will be home all weekend chillin'.  i will be in denver tues afternoon around 2.  i think we are golfing with customers when we get in and i have a dinner that night.  wednes i am in a golf tourney in the morning so maybe that afternoon we can get together.  i have a dinner wednes night. so if we don't get together wednes afternoon maybe lunch thurs before i take off. 
 this video is so funny.  these two guys are a couple of dumb asses. 
 how did you do on the corruption test? 
 how was new years in new orleans?  did you shoot your 9 in tha air @ 12 
 what did you go to dallas this weekend for?  it wasn't fun?  not much went on here.  i am going to denver tomorrow for work for 3 days.  golfing and boozing.  sounds good huh?  i will be back this weekend but i need to save my money for vegas next week. 
 i am going to vegas for a bachelor party.  should be fun.  i don't think you would have fun with us unless you were jumping out of a cake or something. 
 yeah 
 do a mud pie thing 
 sorry to hear that.  did you pass any of the sections?  this weekend was pretty laid back.  what did you do?  i am trying to save money before i go to vegas in two weeks so i will be laying low for a bit. 
 who sings that 80's song  "harley davidson - of a bitch".  that is the corus. 
 there are hurricanes sprouting up everywhere 
 can't make it.  i am saving money for vegas next week. 
 how do you like that ene now?  it is very strong.  i will be in tomorrow around 2pm.  you can reach me on my cell phone at (713)825-8410.  maybe we can get together tomorrow or wednes. 
 no it is 80's club stuff. 
 we can get her a lap dance 
 i get back from denver that night around 10pm so i don't think that i can make it. 
 that place sucks.  lets go somewhere else. 
 who you taking with the second?  can't trade it can you? 
 i am going to take stephen davis. 
 boondoggle.  golf & booze.  i need to meet with some customers. 
 plove only knows the skanks over at the pink pussycat, so that is an option. the girls are not that bad if we bring some clearisil for the blemishes and a couple of cases of beer. 
 i am going to take rodell meally.  he can recover from that acl quickly. 
 your wife isn't on this list.  you don't need to lie about going there. 
 sorry shooter 
 i wont tell.  you could be sakora pine.  that is a pretty good porn name. 
 that is the best news i heard all day.  how was new orleans. 
 i am a big shooter. 
 what is your brother in law's name? 
 I have been out of town the last couple of days.  If you want to meet today that would be fine. 
 you don't like my secretary?  what is going on?  how was your party?  i was in denver. 
 i would go but i need to save money b/c i am going to vegas next weekend.  i was there for work.  it was fun.  we just drank  and went golfing.  let me know what is going on tonight. 
 allegedly 
 i need rest.  i am dead. 
 nevermind.  there was a guy from louisiana at this conference who worked at reliant.  it wasn't your bro in law though. 
 i need to sleep.  i am worn out from denver.  i just went golfing and drinking in denver.  it was fun but now i am tired.  i need to save some money b/c i am going to vegas next weekend.  when is your cruise? 
 i sent her a gift certificate from amazon.  should be in the mail now and it is addressed to lori.  gas did come off.  weather looks nice everywhere.  how was new years? 
 definately.  let me know when you get back and we can go.  have fun. hopefully you won't hit any hurricanes. 
 have you heard any more about vegas? 
 i leave around 6 or 7.  someone needs to send an email and let us know what is up.  do we even have hotel reservations? 
 between 8 & 9.  who all is even going on this thing now? 
 this is funny 
 not  much.  maybe golfing tomorrow.  you still going to austin? 
 that made my day 
 there is no need to redraw 
 we are not redrawing just b/c hoskins quit and the guy with the last pick wants to get a better position. 
 i won't be able to pick up griese if i don't have the first pick 
 keepin it real in 2-0-0-1 
 i think he could go to the pro bowl and start ahead of manning this year. 
 can you follow me to the car dealership at lunch tomorrow at lunch so i can drop off the tahoe to get fixed? 
 i hope you miss that tropical storm in the gulf.  cant believe that there would be any hurricanes this time of the year out there.  did you see 'the perfect storm'? 
 i don't want my car to be powdered up.  it will look like i am driving a mary kay car. 
 foward me the email from jacques. 
 i guess you owe me $50 since you haven't returned with your score.  must have been a pretty high score.  you can pay me whenever or get my money to shirley. 
 that girl jennifer the secretary works up here now.  should i put in a good word for you? 
 what did you do on new years?  sorry i didn't come.  i didn't feel good and i didn't feel like driving 10 hours for a short weekend.  i was glad sunday i wasn't on the road b/c i felt like shit.  did you see lsu? 
 the web page will have everything 
 i think you must have set a record or something on it.  if you would have passed easily i am sure i would have heard from you earlier.  i think you scored around a 200 or something.  don't be a welch.  just admit you lost and pay your debt. 
 check the web again 
 are you looking for a job here or something? 
 use a printer and print it off 
 is that how one of your dirty stories started in that porn mag you have? 
 Here is the forecast.  Our meeting using these numbers won't be until tomorrow so they will most likely change shortly. 
 sorry to send this dumb email but i am supersticious. 
 thanks for sending that chain letter.  i am supersticious. 
 you can't send it back.  those chain letters don't work like that.  what type of car did you buy?  i cant wait to see it and take it out on the town to pick up chicks when i come home. 
 did you and mike go to maiden voyage? 
 teacher of the year 
 i won't be able to play friday.  i leave at 530pm.  i will check on job stuff today.  i will probably need you to email your resume to me when you get a chance. 
 oohh la la.  who was your "friend"?  did you guys read those stories together?  i am good.  i am ready for vegas baby!  it is going to be epic. 
 don't mess with married men.  that is bad karma. 
 i gave her a thrill. 
 two married guys? 
 are you looking to get in to i.t. again or more of a commercial role? 
 home wrecker. 
 send me your resume and i will get it to some people in both groups.  call me tonight and we can discuss this. 
 friday.  i am gonna pick me up a call girl and act out dirty fantasies all weekend.  i want to be dressed in diapers and spanked like a bad boy.  i want to have my diapers changed.  how much do you think all that would cost? 
 i got your email address.  hope you had a great new years.  love matt 
 it won't really go through him b/c he doesn't do the hiring. 
 when i am married i want a girlfriend 
 aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!  them is jus jokes 
 i was thinking a little younger 
 dem is jus jokes 
 i have a trade for you that will give you one more pick.  you give me your 2nd round pick and i will give you my 3rd rd & 6th rd picks.  two for one-zies.  let me know what you think. 
 the best moment of your life 
 cool.  i will be home by 8 tonight 
 do you want to make a trade for your 2nd rd pick? 
 mom said you weren't feeling well.  i just wanted to send you an email to see how you are doing.  i hope you feel better.  hopefully you will be able to make it to denver.  this should make you feel better, i am still terrible at golf.  i shot a 100 the other day, so i think you can still take me.  i will be in vegas this weekend for a bachelor party but i will try to call next week. 
 we just got that center wilkerson.  he is the best lineman in the country. 
 keep me up to date on his condition.  i will be in vegas this weekend so if anything happens please let me know.  you can reach me on my cell phone at 713-8258410.  your car sounds great.  see you soon. 
 don't deny it. 
 i was thinking that i give you a 3rd and 4th for your 2nd 
 those are pretty funny.  i am going to vegas this weekend.  i will play some slots for you. 
 i will play 
 does that get you through the night?  thinking of the passion and heat you felt in the cold & frigid air in colorado. 
 here is something to be proud of.  i can put this on a resume.  tom, you can say you lived it. 
 i haven't written all day.  sorry.  i usually just wait for you to write and then reply. 
 I will give you my 2nd, 5th, 8th  for your 2nd & 6th 
 you just slipped and fell b/c you were in such a hurry b/c your were so excited 
 i need to pick up my jacket tonight.  will you be there around 7? 
 i am going to vegas.  you always bring sex up anyway.  plus that is all we know of eachother. 
 vegas baby!  i spoke with jacques the other night.  he is going to leave a message with me at the desk.  so i will leave one there with you.  we are at harrah's accross from ceasars and mirage.  better have your game face on dog. 
 the theme for the weekend is " can til i can't" - drink from when i can see til i can't. 
 in 
 you fear it 
 let me think about it.  i am deep at wr.  show me a bid for griese and maybe something can be worked out. 
 do i have enough time to grow a mullet? 
 what about extensions or a weave?  do you think those would look natural? tell me what i should wear. 
 no thanks 
 vegas was fun.  i am tired.  i had to go to portland afterwards. 
 great.  he can go there with all the talent in the world and get run by the pac-10. 
 ah no thanks 
 i am in on this 
 i am emailing about the football pool.  bryan hull told me to give you an email and you could sign me up.  just let me know what i need to do.  matt lenhart 
 griese for duece 
 did you go on your vacation yet?  i hope you are not on it now b/c there is a huge hurricane heading into the gulf.  you could end up like gilligan. 
 are you guys going on a date or something 
 i will tell him i am your pimp 
 woman dont ya know i'll kill ya 
 i will take that bet. 
 i don't have hbo 
 you should thow a rager.  congrats 
 i hope i have a girlfriend after i get married.  that would be nice. 
 did i say something wrong? 
 which age comment?  the one when i said that you were too old to be my girlfriend after i get married? 
 yeah baby i am in town this weekend.  i called the h.r. woman and she hasn't called back.  i am gonna email her your resume.  it looked good. 
 hey, cheer up pumpkin.  you aren't thirty yet so don't worry about it. 
 um, why do your knees hurt?  have you been bad? 
 i am always good.  i know the secret.  but i haven't put my good secret to use lately. 
 she was on howard stern and some 18 year old won a prom date with heard and lost his v-card.  she kind of dated him for a bit.  nice girl. 
 you make them.  i just don't think they will win the next two nat'l champ. 
 give me edgerrin 
 i was about to accept that. 
 well compared to chad i get more action than a porn star.  the secret is a secret.  i can't let it out.  you saw that seinfeld. 
 Harry-  I just offered up a trade to you.  Take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think. 
 where are you with your family?  i went to vegas and lost money.  watch out for that  hurricane.  if it strenthens think of me b/c i will be happy b/c that will mean that gas prices increase.  we will go out and party when you get back. 
 yeah.  uh thanks for calling  at 1:30.   you sounded mollered.  where did you go?  who did you go out with? 
 make some changes and i will send it to her today.  she didn't get back to me but i will call her again today.  i might go tonight.  what time is it tonight. 
 just send it to me from home tonight and i will get it to the lady tomorrow. let me know if you go tonight and i might tag along. 
 are you going to try to be an investment banker on wall street?  that would be cool.  i could visit & try to meet some models that i might want to marry. 
 i mean big 12.  i don't think they will win the next two nat'l championships.  texas definately won't. 
 i wish i lived the life of a rock star.  that would be good.  actually life is good.  work is going well.  do you feel better?  hopefully we can get out to phoenix over thanksgiving again so you can beat the tar out of me at golf.  here is my analogy of you & me at golf:  you are tiger woods on sunday and i am greg norman at the masters on sunday.  i will try to call this weekend.  love matt 
 you are in nyc?  no your not.  don't set me up with the dirty talker, i am afraid she would embarass me. 
 i hope it becomes a hurricane too.  huricanne = $$$$ for me.  call me when you get back from your 3 week vacation.  it must be really hard over there at deloit. 
 are you really in nyc? 
 you lucked out.  there isn't a hurricane. 
 i probably will party tomorrow b/c it is going to be the best day of work ever.  i actually kind of interviewed at csfb in nyc.  that would be huge if you got a job with them.  i know two guys that work there.   if you are in banking you better get used to 80-100 hours a week.  talk to you later holmes. 
 we cant go get drinks if you are in a body cast.  that would look to crazy. i would be trying to pour a margarita down the opening for your mouth.  i am glad the weather is good.  it really doesn't matter too much about the hurricane.  call me when you get back. 
 lucky fuck 
 i went to woody's last night.  there was such a hottie coming in when i was leaving and i would have stayed but today was such a big day at work i couldn' t be exhausted and hung over.  she could have been my wife.  i love woody's when it is warm.  ken's email is kenneth.shullklapper@enron.com 
 i meant the big 12.  i don't think that they will win the next two. 
 Toni-  Here is the resume I left you a message about.  Get back to me when you get a chance.  Thank you,  Matt Lenhart 
 i told her that you were interested in her 
 sure.  maybe. 
 put it in the paper dog 
 marquis.  i like volcanoes better.  good day at work? 
 what does sp mean? 
 you must be on this "best conference" kick b/c your team lost.  sec had a down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.  lsu beat a good georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.  texas lost to a pac-10 team.  i don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.  i will pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that smoked you guys in dallas. 
 just open an account at www.wsex.com 
 this is a league where you pick all 16 games on the spread each week and if you get the most games correct you win $$.  it is only 50 
 looks like the flight will depart,  but they cannot give me info until tomorrow.  the flights today are taking off.  i arrive at 8:55. 
 i get in thurs night.  we can go out either fri or sat or both. 
 this guy is a regular carl lewis 
 i see your brother in law doing some trades on line with us 
 8-3.  tenn.  sucks.  we roll them. 
 i leave for denver on thurs. 
 lsu owns texas.  did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most important collegiate tournaments?  why does everyone from ut think they have such a storied program?  you haven't won in decades.  your current coach has proved he can't win big games.  you guys will be ranked high (as you were this year), but you won't hold that ranking.  texas has the easiest schedule and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.  all i heard last year at this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned out.  you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou. good luck. 
 i heard you were anyway 
 we can get drinks wed if you would like. let me know when a good time is. 
 i get back monday night.  we can get a drink next week.  that actually works out better for me anyway.  what are you doing this weekend. 
 i haven't found out about my test yet.  i am pretty sure i failed.  i didn't study enough. 
 i called her and she still isn't there.  i wonder if she still has a job here. 
 she still works here.  she is probably on vacation or something.  i am sure she will get right back to daddy when she gets in town.  she sounds hot. 
 i am going to denver.  i will be ready for it next week. 
 i am going to denver tomorrow.  i am excited to get home for a couple of days.  how did you know i went to the black swan?  i saw some girl who was at that wedding we went to and she lives in your apt. complex. 
 i had manning but i traded him away b/c i had no backs.  now i have vodka collins starting for me. 
 did you talk to max?  what night should we go out?  if we only go out 1 night i vote sat.  if we go out both that is cool too.  what time is cu/csu? 
 i am going to go out.  give me a call at home or on my cell. 
 csu is the underdog and i would bet that they get punished.  tell max to stay out of the ghetto.  property there doesn't appreciate. 
 thanks for the email.  i am hopefully taking off tomorrow night, but i am not sure b/c  i am flying united.  it will be good to be home for a few days. vegas was fun.  i went for a bachelor party.  some of my friends are starting to fall.  i hope billie's mom is okay.  i will talk to you soon.  love matt 
 what the fuck are the highlands 
 isn't that where the vatos live 
 i have that work trip on oct. 21st.  is there another weekend that you could come to n.o.? 
 disregard my last email.  we might not be going on that weekend. 
 i called united and it sounds like my flight will fly.  see you tonight. 
 i can go that weekend. 
 is that your babe 
 we couldn't get in.  the line wasn't moving so we went to the hub.  i tried to call your cell phone and leave a message.  i got your message late last night about the movie.  my cell phone was upstairs and i couldn't hear it ringing.  how was mercury room? 
 nothing more sexy than a girl that can dance 
 what is going on?  i don't think we need your tickets.  if you want me to try to sell them there i will.  how was labor day weekend for you?  what did you do? 
 can you foward me the rules for that loser league? 
 can you send down your rockies forecast again?  i need to look at your numbers for the winter again.  thanks  matt 
 that game was great.  i was so impressed with griese & gary & the whole office.  the defense is a major concern.  i am torn between being impressed with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out b/c of that defense.  st. louis had a good defense last year.  i hope their defense is still good b/c that would say a lot about our offense. 
 how was your labor day. 
 37176 
 the defense couldn't even stop them.  they have no place to go but up.  i am concerned about the d.  you need that to win in the playoffs. 
 olandis gary tore his acl.  he is out for the season. 
 nope.  we can hit the town this weekend.  i like that place the hub.  they play good music. 
 how did that happen.  i thought there was all mo's and no ho's. 
 who is that 
 Eric told me to shoot you an email to bid on a free agent.  I want to bid $5 on Mike Anderson of the Broncos.  Let me know what else I need to do.  Thanks, Matt 
 during the 3rd quarter 
 do i need to just send you a check for $20 or should i just send the $50?  is there just a tally at the end of the year with the payouts then? 
 congratulations!  is that in austin or houston? 
 denver was nice.  i just played golf and took it easy.  when is your test? are you watching the lsu game this weekend?  i think that we are going have a bbq somewhere for the game.  i will let you know. 
 daddy won the first week. 
 what are you going to be doing? 
 cram 
 we will finish top ten next year in the polls 
 you guys have happy hour every night.  what time are you going thurs? 
 so are you now an analyst - investment banker?  is your pay better?  are you going to work 90 hours a week? 
 , 
 you going?  if it is next weekend sign me up. 
 only problem is that there is an lsu game sat. 
 what does he trade 
 remember this.  we might need to go check it out after  the game. 
 i heard it was good.  i think we might check it out after the game. 
 bbq at tim's or something and then lets go to the crawl thing. 
 i am going to tonight. 
 Here is the morning ops.  Congrats on the new baby. 
 if shirley hasn't left town yet i think i can get him a ticket.  let him come even if nobody back out anyway.  it doesn't matter squeezing 1 more person into the room. 
 i can probably meet up with you guys around 7:30ish.  will you guys still be there at that time?  call me on my cell at (713)853-7176 if you guys go somewhere else. 
 i will drive if it doesn't rain.  my windshield wipers don't work. 
 hoskins car is too small 
 the girl i was going to talk to in this group is out today.  i will talk to her.  she is always asking me if i know any analyst who need work.  i am gonna be a rock star sat night. 
 this isn't porn is it 
 i will try to meet you there 
 did you open an account on world sports exchange?  if you open one use me as the referral and i will split the $50 with you and we can make a bet.  i might go meet jill and them for drinks around 730 if you want to go. 
 call the cell 
 queen 
 thanks for sending me another chain letter.  i am very superstitious. 
 how was last night?  sorry i didn't make it.  i was planning on going but i got home late.  i did check out woody's.  it was ok.  when do you leave for okla? 
 where did you guys go after cadillac? 
 have you signed up with world sports exchange?  refer me.  my user name is mlenhart.  we can split the $50 that they will put into my account and place a parlay bet. 
 sammy marcos and wayne gonz want to come 
 you have too much time on your hands. 
 when you do it give me a call on my cell and i will call in a bet. 
 i think we might go to someones place and then go out afterwards 
 i know someone else who wants to play coed softball if there are space available for guys. 
 try to find out where club monkey is going sat and we will front run them to the bar. 
 here it is 
 i have a good idea for that business.  there are all these gov't forclosure properties that we should buy up cheap.  we can discuss it more next time we get drunk. 
 i heard langley is out for the year.  who will fill that gap? 
 no subject = ebonics?  that makes no sense. 
 i heard it is 8.5.  i will try to talk to someone today. 
 it was ok.  i went to austin fri night and watched the ut game on sat.  how was that wedding?  was it worth going up to neckville, oklahoma? are you hitting the town this week?  let me know if you want to go get a drink. 
 do you have your resume to email me again.  i can't remember where i saved it. 
 i can get you on that team if you can get that girl to play.  i guess they need girls on the team 
 i am worried about them dropping like flies.  i thought last year we were injury prone but this year is worse.  i am still skeptical about the defense.  next week will tell a lot. 
 i want to do it.  it will be fun to be your boss. 
 not you please.  she can wear one.  i think it is on tues. 
 rules of attraction less than zero glamorama  read in that order. 
 i heard from the girl you beat up.  she told me you said "what are you looking at bitch?"  and then you told her "this is central fool, you'd betta recognize!".  sounded like you really took it to her.  i am going to the tenn game.  i am probably going to woodrows for the next game. 
 they told me to send in the resume to h.r. 
 i tried but they have to go through it anyway.  i told them to inquire about your resume. 
 it was just those three.  you have to read them in that order. 
 we should go to n.o. over the first weekend in december and catch the broncos at the saints 
 we can do that or go when we planned and hit the lsu game 
 mike-  here are some of the ops sheets.  let me know if you need some of the others.  the cali power sheet is down so i cannot send it. 
 what did the sluts look like 
 i lost your number in austin.  i tried to give you a call last night and clear up our argument  from saturday.  that got way out of hand and i apologize for that.  there is no reason for me to be such a hot head about that.  give me a call when you get a chance and we can clear up that mess. your parents got your stuff yesterday.  let me know what you want to do with that tv.  talk to you later.  matt 
 see about scheduling that weekend then.  it is the weekend of dec. 3rd. 
 i won 3 of 4 sunday afternoon, lost 50 sunday night and lost 80 last night. struggled at the end.  going out thurs? 
 is that nov. 30?  i probably cannot get there until fri.  i can get tickets 
 that is really classy 
 i am making money taking the other side of the boys.  they suck this year. worst part is that they don't have 1st round picks next year.  call chris gaskill.  he should be able to send you a file of those gas dailies.  later. 
 i cannot go. 
 Cooper-  Here is the list of the hour ahead scheduled flows:  Generation: Load:  Imp/Exp: Humb  Humb  COI_BG NP15  NP15  El Dorado SF  SF  Mead SP15  SP15  PV ZP26  ZP26  Path 15   If we can get the data starting 9/1/2000 that would be great.  Thanks again for your help.  I hope this isn't too much trouble.  Matt 
 i sent your stuff into to someone else in h.r.  i haven't heard anything yet.  you might hear something before i do.  if i hear anything i will let you know.  woody's tomorrow? 
 i've got a great haircut 
 saban should tell him don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. 
 i am having the weekend kickoff tonight at woody's.  sat i think i am going to hit woodrows  to catch the lsu game.  what are you doing?  did you go to dave matthews? 
 do you want to go up to dallas the weekend of oct 7th and catch the ou-tex game.  i heard it is wild up there around that time.  all ou and tx chicks. we can stay at emmitts or something. 
 sorry about last night.  dinner took a while at el tiempo.  i was dead after eating. 
 are you going out tonight?  we are going to woodrow's for the game tomorrow. 
 yeah call me tonight.  i might try to go get a drink and just hang out tonight.  game is at 6.30.; 
 how about the broncos?  they looked good.  defense is still suspect. 
 you missed a hell of a saturday night.  all these hot chi-o's were a woodrows watching the lsu game.  they were all in from out of town and we met up with them later to go out.  there were about 12 of them and i would say 7 were hotties. 
 what about football 
 yeah.  didn't you get it already? 
 what is up with cu?  they suck.  i'm not going to run my mouth about the broncos b/c i don't want to jinx them.  defense will get better as they play more. 
 call me back.  i accidently hit a button on the phone to disconnect. 
 i am in.  do you need anyone else to play b/c chad wants to play if we have room.  we could always use another pass rusher. 
 are the softball games tues nights?  when do they start? where are they?  i need to tell that chick. 
 you can play football.  we play tomorrow night at 7pm. 
 yeah.  both of you can go.  just show up. 
 looks like we are going to have to find a couple of loser fijis who can't find dates for the tennessee game and lift their tickets.  i am so fired up for that game.  tim just told me it is the 6:30 game on espn. 
 Cooper-  The sheet that you sent me earlier doesn't refresh anymore.  It is  saying that a rollback transaction is missing.  Let me know if I need to do anything to fix it.  Thanks for your help.  Matt 
 what happened to griese? 
 here is the info.  let that chick know. 
 just let me know 
 no.  tell her it is off of buffalo spwy. 
 so you are going to just stay in and tame the shrue all night 
 sounds like you would be calculating a book each day.  it might be a good entry into trading, but i would check with them on how they have their program set up to get people into trading positions.  let me check with h.r. today.  they move slow.  i would ask some questions on that posting to find out where it would put you eventually.  trading is the way to go.  more money in trading and your opportunities would open up throughout the industry. 
 i think she is in.  i would stay away from scheduling.  you definately don't want to do that.  we might go out tonight to sierra.  i will let you know. 
 Pat-  I am bidding $5 for nedney (kicker-denver) 
 where you been bra? 
 i just spoke to someone who said they would make sure you get in for an interview.  i will know more in a couple of days. 
 i still owe you $30 right? 
 it is good.  it isn't his best.  wait until you get to glamorama.  so you have us set up for the 30th. 
 we got one more girl to play 
 is this on mon or tues 
 she is the one who is going to play 
 off of i-10 
 give me a call at work when you get a chance 
 Sara-  I am sending the resume of a friend of mine who I think is a good candidate for the associate program.  Please get back to me and let me know what else I need to do to get him in for an interview.  Thank you for your help.  Matt Lenhart 
 what does mmmcchhhaaa mean?  is that the scary sound from friday the 13th? things have been good.  just been working a lot and living it up a little. that is great that you started teaching 4th grade.  i watched florida play last week.  they got lucky.  we will have to make a bet on the lsu-flor game.  i will take the points of course.  i will let you think of the bet since you are into that stuff.  i went out with jen & max in denver.  i guess they are back together.  what is a good smaller town in florida to live in. one with golf courses right on the ocean. 
 anne-  any luck with those np & sp/ on-off peak curves?  let me know when you get  a chance.  thanks, matt 
 Toni-  Here is a copy of my friends resume again.  Let me know if you can get him in for an interview.  Thanks,  Matt Lenhart

 kayci-  what is going on?  the address for the place we are staying at is 931 st. peter.  it is on the same block as the gold mine and runs perpendicuar to bourbon st.  i will have my cell on me fri and that number is (713)825-8410. i arrive in new orleans aroudn 5:30 fri night so we can meet up whenever you guys want.  if you guys need a place to stay there is plenty of space in this house.  be ready to party.  don't wear your camoflauge when we go out.  i don't want to be embarrassed.  just kidding. 
 that is b/c that pussy knows he wont play 
 7 
 do we need any more people (chicks) on our team? 
 that is totally cory 
 i am glad you reminded me b/c i completely forgot.  this couldn't come at a better time b/c i am fucking broke.  i haven't been this since school.  send it to:  1212 fairview #a houston, tx 77006  wait until you get to glamorama.  it is the best except for 1 nasty chapter. you will know when you get to it.  lsu is on espn this sat night.  look for me tied on to some 19 year old hottie  drunk off my ass.  i will have some pledges tie around my head and bourbon all over the front of my shirt.  just go ahead and over night that check. 
 they figured it out.  it was their mistake.  how is everything.  i am going to baton rouge this weekend for the lsu game.  i should be fun.  i will call sunday. 
 i think that i am going to take it easy tonight.  i am going to br tomorrow so i need my rest.  are you going to the lsu game?  i cannot wait to get back in town.  where are you guys going out afterwards? 
 we have a softball game chief 
 i don't know but the field is located off of i-10 
 so i will take minn (1.5).  you want that? 
 san antonio and vidor 
 did you get in  touch with kim 
 you must be bad luck for the tigers.  was it fun last weekend?  i havent heard of lz's.  what do you guys  have 8 happy hours a week? 
 i was just in town over labor day weekend.  my hoodlum friends and i didn't get into too much trouble.  so do you have to learn new "internet terms"  in your new job.  you need do be able to talk the talk with those it folks. well the job sounds good if you are going to retire in one year.  i think i am going to work until i am 40 then i am moving to florida to live on the beach.  so how is denver?  i miss the good weather.  have you guys been partying?  did you have any good gossip for me.  you need to fill me in b/c i am way out of the loop.  good luck with your new job and email me back when you get a chance.  matt 
 is this going to be the buying op for apple? 
 i couldn't believe it when i heard it.  i would just hold it.  i am going to baton rouge this weekend.  hope all is well.  take care. 
 we are playing tenn.  they are going to hammer us.  i am going in.  it should be on at 530 espn your time.  griese and davis starting sunday? 
 do you have an extra glove?  also let me know where the game is at tues. what is the next game you are going in for? 
 i am in if our football game is at 9 
 i got min -1.5 for $30 
 bama is a definate.  just call me tomorrow and we can go out there.  i hope there is a hottie working 1st.  i will hit singles all day. 
 i am in. 
 the lsu game rocked.  davey hasn't been playing b/c he has been hurt.  if he would have played last week we would have beat uab.  denver defense sucks. that game made me sick.  i can do can cun for sure.  just let me know the dates.  what happened to cu?  i heard marcus houston hurt his hip. 
 it was awesome.  i didn't get your message until last night.  i didn't have my phone with me there.  it was so much fun.  that was one of the greatest games that i went to.  where did you watch it?  it sounded like you were partying some. 
 i will be in for cancun for sure. 
 i guess that means we need to go back to some more games.  i cant believe we didn't go. 
 when are we going to go get drinks with celeste's friend that is the hottie? 
 how about that game?  did you get to see it?  tell celeste to set it up for thurs.  we will go hit some cool place for drinks. 
 i went.  it was incredible.  one of the best games i have seen there.  rohan is the man.  we would be 4-1 if he could have played last week.  big game sat.  we need to do something for the game. 
 what do you mean i wasn't doing so hot saturday night?  i thought i was in great shape.  i was dancing better than menudo.  i was hurting when we left sat.  i almost puked in my car when i was driving back to houston.  going back to football games is so much fun, but the drinking kills you.  i haven't drank that much for that long in a while.  it was worth it.  i am tired today, but it is nice for everyone to say how we kicked ass this weekend.  i still can't believe you didn't get tickets.  i had extras.  i could have hooked you up.  i heard brittney spears was at fred's on sat night.  did you hear that.  not that i am a fan of hers, i just heard that.  shoot me another email when you get a chance.  matt 
 yeah.  you?  we have an extra day also.  i want to go out sat. 
 sorry i didn't call you back last night.  i went to bed.  i will try to call you tonight or tomorrow. 
 sounds good.  how long would we stay in cancun?  i don't think i can take 2 weeks again this year.  i could meet you in n.o. and we could fly from there or if you have to go to cancun through houston i can meet you here.  i will try to call tonight after my softball game.  hope all is well. 
 have you ever been to monterey, cali?  i get to go there in two weeks for a pipeline meeting.  it looks gorgeous.  is grandma still staying in town with you? 
 you said some embarrassing things on the message.  just kidding.   this weekend will probably be low key.  i am sure i will go out sat.  what are you doing? 
 i am down in the crowd somewhere. 
 i dont remember monterey.  i think i missed it when i was curled in a ball in the back seat freezing my ass off.  i cant wait.  i looks awesome. 
 i am playing golf one day.  i am going to fly into sf and drive down the coast to monterey.  should be nice. 
 i ran on the field.  it looked awesome.  i had a blast.  it was one of the top 3 games  i saw at tiger stadium. 
 it is okay if i am getting old b/c i age really well.  anyway, men get distinguished as they age.  i don't care how old i get just as long as i keep my hair.  i can't believe you don't like freds when it is packed.  that is the best time to be at that place.  i do feel better at work today.  i found out i get to go to monterey, cali in two weeks for a boondoggle.  it is all paid for and all i will do is booze and golf.  i look foward shit like that now.    you should be going out every night while you can.  one day you will hit the real world and you can't do that.  lsu is not the real world.  you can still party a lot while you work, you just have to be in pain at work and pretend like you are not hung over so the
