 Does that mean you are in like swimwear? PL 
 That boy's heed is like sputnik.  It should have its own weather system...That was cruel...he will probably cry himself to sleep tonight...on his huge pillow. 
 speaking of ethics, what is up with the Brooke situation? PL 
 I will need a replacement for Chuck unless I get another trading track person.  I will also need a replacement for Ben Pham, for which Dave(bench) will also need a replacement. PL 
 Thanks for the invite.  We are going to JasonTidwell's wededding in Galveston Saturday - it starts at 6 p.m.  We are not planning on staying too long and should be back in Clear Lake before 8 p.m.  We will go pick up Jackson and shoot over if that is ok.  Who bought the house?  I hate to hear that they are leaving so soon.  When does your dad have to go back to the middle east?  I do not care if what you guys have to drink, thanks for thinking of me with the no bud products.  When do you guys get in?  I am off tomorrow, so give me a call at the house. See you soon.  Looking forward to seeing you guys. PL

 I just got Robin Zivic's info.  rzivic is her log on. PL 
 I am not officializing 1091026 because we ran two basis calcs for the last= =20 day and we officialized the other one and it has the same value - that post= =20 id is 1091034.  Also, FT-Ontario's book admin is now Patrick Ryder, Market= =20 Mich is Jad Doan and FT Intra Ontario is Chuck Ames.  Please shout with=20 anymore questions.  Thanks. PL 
 I just tested loading yesterday and it worked.  I will start with tonight's info.  Sorry about that. PL 
 unfortunately I am busy as usual.  Looking forward to the long weekend to get some much needed rest.  It seems like it is always something up here.  Any plans for easter?  How are things with you?  Baby doing good?  Take care. PL 
 ANR Mainline 7 - no meter to be assigned, schedulers have to call CP's on a deal by deal basis and determine meter. Thanks. PL 
 Attached is a file that includes the tagg # for the liquidation in question below.  Hope this helps. PL 
 I am going with Wachsler  tomorrow, so maybe we can hook up and have a beer. Darron has my cell number 713-819-0765. PL 
 what's up?  I hear you have a girlfriend in Houston and are here all the time, yet I never hear from you?  Seems you enjoy Darron's company better than mine. PL 
 good luck.   I would also suggest having a fire extinguisher handy as well. You can also always say the turkey is a Texas tradition - blackened.  Deer Valley is in Utah - 45 minutes outside Salt Lake City.  I got airfair from Houston for 200 per person.  Have a happy turkey day. PL 
 I will double check with Patrice in the a.m.  Thanks. PL 
 I heard about this last week, pretty nasty. PL 
 I heard about this last week...pretty nasty PL

 Can you set up mids for the following locations please: APLP - Intramonth curve - Alliance, GD curve GDP-Alliance NIPS - intramonth curve- NGI/CHI./NIPSCO, GD Curve GDC-CHI./NIPSCO Thanks. PL 
 no worries.  How is the week going?  Good I hope.  I just interviewed a guy from Auburn and hopefully got him a job.  We will see. PL 
 that was the one, oh well. PL 
 I just don't want you getting me worked up when there is nothing I can do about it now. PL 
 pretty funny.  Hey - we just got upgraded to Windows 2000(sucks) and I lost the screen saver you sent me, do you still have that file? PL 
 Here is the file.  Sorry it is a day late - teh price desk had some errors in teh file adn I was waiting for them to correct the deals.  Thanks. PL 
 The location is NBPL/Ventura TP/08NBPL Ventura Transfer PT PL 
 thanks for all of your help, it looks like we have found someone internal to the group to fill the need.  I will keep talking with Monica in Portland for July rotation.  Thanks again. PL 
 I got converted to Windows 2000 yesterday, so I believe I need a new file. Is that correct? PL 
 Can you give me a list of the deals that we have currently on APLP  and NIPS - they will both be in the Market CG book.  Patrice is wanting to move these deals to a new curve and we are trying to get a handle on the number of deals that will be effected.  This will be effective for april out.  Thanks. PL 
 deadline 7 a.m. tomorrow morning.  Send to Eric Groves PL 
 Your lucky those cans didn't explode and get all over your clothes huh? Thanks again, it actually tastes pretty good, but you know my criteria for beer - cold.  I was just giving you a hard time about the name, that is reason #4761 why it is good to be a man.  Ashley did the same thing with the middle name, that way you keep some of your family.  We finally got some cold weather here.  I know you guys just got back from a vacation, but were wondering if you might like to join us for a skiing trip to Deer Valley.  We are going Jan 6 - 13th.  The accomodations are paid for, you would just have lift tickets and airfare.  We are staying in a ski in and ski out condo, so we are going to do some grocery shopping and cook.  Jason Tidwell and his girlfriend are coming in on the 6th and leaving on the 9th, so if you want to come in half time, that is cool too.  Just let us know. Talk to you soon. PL 
 deadline 7 a.m. tomorrow morning.  Eric Groves is running it. PL 
 7 a.m. deadline tomorrow. PL 
 money and entry due by 7 a.m. tomorrow. PL 
 Attached is the final standings for the pool.  Please verify your score.  We had a little drama for second place, Chuck won the tie breaker due to a total of 158 versus Wolfie's 145(total score was 154).  Special congratulations to Matt Lenhart for bringing up the rear(nice pick on the last game too).  Hope to see you guys next year. PL 
 sorry it took so long - this is done. PL 
 we do not get deal tickets from the desk for transportation on a regular basis - very sporadic. PL 
 FYI - keep an eye out for these. PL 
 How are things going?  Good I hope.  Give me a call when you get a chance I need to see about getting your phone number so that I can have you cut my mom's grass.  She is in need of a new lawncare service.  You ought to have your number listed so we can get a hold of you.  Thanks. PL 713-853-7376(o) 281-486-7026(h) 
 I apologize for not including the following curve in the original list: GDP-Iroquois - $5.80  It looks like all the other ones are done, is that correct? Thanks again. PL 
 Going with the old hyphen huh???  How corporate of you.  Hey, we got the beer.  Thanks alot.  Did customs give you a hard time for bringing a bunch of booze back?  Talk to you soon. PL 
 I meant to email you over the weekend to let you know it was on it's way. Just be sure to fill out the matching gifts form.  Please let me know if there is any hold up on that.  Looks like we will not make it back to Auburn until the fall for football season.  I will give you a call a few weeks before we come in to set up a tour of the raptor center/vet school.  Thanks again for your help in completing this special occasion for my family.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 Attached is a file listing all of the curves we had that posted as 0 price for 3/31/01.  We need these pub posted as the same price as the 30th - prices are included in this file.  We need these pub posted ASAP so that we can flash march detail.  Risk does not have authorization to override an existing pub posting, this is why we need your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a shout.  Thanks for your help. PL 3-7376 
 got it. PL 
 I think you guys are doing a great job and are very timely in the requests we submit.  The only area I see for improvement is better follow up on access requests to the systems.  I am very happy with reim requests and general assistance you provide.  Thanks. PL 
 here is the file from last night. PL 
 Please change the book coding on this log in to FT-Peoples.  Thanks. PL 
 IF ANR/OK 
 Do you want to go over to the game in two weeks?  I got four tickets - 2 for your brother and 1 for me.  Ashley is staying home.  Let me know. PL 
 Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing tonight.  Thanks. PL 3-7376 
 The information you needed for 1100, roughly 310K, should be a firm book variance as well on the other side.  Portfolio accounting should have a variance that offsets this(hopefully we have not already taken it, I will look).  This means you will not have any actuals on it for FRED.  I will start looking for dec info you just requested. PL 
 Here is the file from last night.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks. PL 3-7376 
 Flip these asap. PL 
 I have another sitara request for someone that shows as pending to them, but is not on my list to approve.  This is for Maria Garza.  Please grant the access requested in this number.  Thanks.  any questions 3-7376 PL 
 I have previously approved this request for chuck ames.  It appears this request is in limbo somewhere in the system.  Please grant him access per this request for Sitara.  Should you have any questions or need further assistance, please give me a call 3-7376. PL 
 Here is the file updated with orig through 3/27/01.  Please let me know if you do not want to continue to get this email each day we have granted orig. Thanks. PL 
 I have been meaning to email you all day.  I  have been extremely busy as wel.  I am sorry to hear that.  Ashley and I were looking forward to going out to dinner with you guys on Saturday.  Maybe we will call your folks and see if they would like to go out for your dad's bday.  I will have to give him a call tomorrow to wish him happy birthday.  Do you have his number at work or an email at work?  Thanks.  We look forward to seeing you soon.  Take care. PL

 Would you mind setting this guy up for us to interview ASAP.  Darron, Kam, Dave, Errol and myself.  Thanks. PL 
 Thanks for your help great one. PL 
 Don't worry about it, it is too late in the day anyway and he leaves the office around 4 - 4:30 PL 
 Happy Birthday old man.  I am not sure if my voice mail will make it to you(I got some weird instructions), so I thought I would cover my bases.  I have been real busy at work and did not mail your gift until Friday.  It will be a few days late - sorry.  Hope you enjoyed your bachelor time this weekend. Can't beat peace and quiet.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 We can always count on you to at least give us one on the error report. PL 
 What is going on man?  Any more news on the dilemma we discussed a few weeks ago?  Just curios.  Hope things are going good for you. PL 1-800-97- ENRON Ext 3-7376 
 No changes for me - Sithe. PL 
 Attached is the updated scores.  Please check your scores to verify accuracy.  As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.  If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.  The rest of us are out of it.  If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams remaining.  By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a charitable deduction for your $10). PL 
 FYI, it may be wise to run a few of your macros from Jeff's machine.  I would just see if it runs and close without saving. PL 
 Thanks again for your help.  Everything looks good. PL 
 FYI 
 yeah, he finally apologized and it is water under the  bridge.  We usually have a heated disagreement once a year.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 What's up in the hood?  It sounds like you guys live in Compton instead of San Diego?  Make sure Emma starts packing when she starts kindergarten.  If she is strapped, she can shoot back at these SOBs.  Yet another reason Texas is better than Cali - we all have guns so no one shoots up schools because they know someone else has got heat and might put a cap in their ass.  Do you guys want me to order you Jazz Fest tickets when I order ours?  I am putting in an order for alot of people because if I mail order them it only costs $3 total as opposed to ticket master's $3 fee per ticket.  Since I am ordering ours this way, I can order everyone's and they only pay the ticket price(I eat the $3 because I am doing ours this way anyway).  The tickets are $15 through the mail per day as opposed to $20 at the gate and $18 through ticketmaster.  Let me know.  I am ordering all three days for ashley and I hoping we go all three days. PL 
 Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?  I figure you spend so much time there you can reccomend a few to me.  I have a coworker going up there next month and it is their first time to chicago.  I gave them Etta James Place to go on rush and on the south side.  Can you think of any other?  Thanks. PL 
 We have made some slight changes to the orig schedule and may make a few more per Laura Luce, the director that is over all of the orig teams.  It is vitally important that we do two things with this file now.  We must fill in all columns on the first tab - orig schedule and we must put all orig deals in the schedule - even if no orig is granted.  THis policy is in effect starting today.  Shout with any questions. PL 
 sorry for taking so long, it has been a very busy week.  Where are you sitting these days?  I am still on 32.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 Please give me a call when you get a chance to discuss the schedule I sent earlier.  Sylvia gave me some information she thought you might want in the schedule.  Thanks. PL 3-7376 
 Thanks anyway.  I have some information that Darron kept on Cilco, I am still having trouble finding any deals for 98 that can show me we definitely did or did not flash these deals wrong.  I am going to keep working on it. PL 
 Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.  I have attached the revised schedule.  Please note the following changes - on the 1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination was granted.  We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday. The other changes are the second tab.  The second tab provides a summary by originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.  We will update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value was originated or not.  We will then email this schedule to the three of you every time the schedule changes.  If you would prefer a hard copy, please let me know.  If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please let me know.  Thanks. PL 
 it is now done. PL 
 Please run a forwards detail on your books and email me if you have any value for these counterparties as of 12/29/01.  Jad we will do yours together. Thanks. PL 
 Price is changed.  Geoff Storey did not want to argue with counterparty. PL 
 sounds good to me to tsf. PL 
 Where are these being transferred from?  I only have the december forms. PL

 I opened the file I sent you and it was filled out. I will try again, let me know if you still have it as blank. PL 
 What email are you talking about?  I don't recall being ugly at all to you. Please paraphrase want ticked you off.  Things are going great, unfortunately still working too much, but just got back from Vegas with some extra cash.  How is the baby?  PL 
 I have you as paid.  There are two sheets on the file, when I sorted by score I did not highlight the paid column.  Only the people's name on the email owe money.  I will add Rob Fuller to the list. PL 
 here is the file you requested.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 We will be here for Easter.  I am off work on that good friday, it is a nymex holiday, so we can hang out.  Give me a shout.  Looking forward to it.  Did Jason go to Vegas this weekend?  I thought you had said he was going.  I had a blast, won about $650.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 I hope you know I am sending these to you in jest.  I think it is funny.  In all seriousness, good luck this weekend.  Even with your record, I am nervous. PL 
 What about toomer's corner after an Auburn victory? 
 This is absolutely hilarious.  We checked it out on Nike's website and it appears to be legitimate. PL 
 Sorry it has taken so long to get the scores out.  After 4 days in Vegas, please check your scores - I am still in a daze.  Kansas - please forward attachment to your friend Kris, Denver forward to Josh Stevens and John Swinney please forward to Rob Fullen.  Here are the list of people I still need money from: Josh Stevens Denver Plachy Jimmy Simien Eric Bass Flannigan Jason Wolfe  Money must be to me by COB Wednesday or your entry is forfeited(if your score is bad and you do not pay I will not put you in any pool in the future).  Right now the pot is $410(assuming everyone pays) so the break down is $307.50 and $102.50 for first and second respectively.  The following people need to give me a tiebreaker number for the final game by COB Today(total score for final game): Jason Wolfe Denver Plachy Scott Earnest Chad South Doug Friedman John Nowlan Lee Jackson John Swinney Rob Fullen Josh Stevens  If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed differential.  Thanks everyone for playing. PL 3-7376 
 We got them, the guy next to me was collecting and found them, I will send out an email later this morning with the scores. PL 
 demand charge for #444771. PL 
 FYI- We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for physical deals.  We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.  Usually these are less than .05 different.  If you have a physical mich physical it should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara), if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.  Any questions, ask.  Thanks. PL 
 Here it is.  Thanks. PL 
 I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.  This relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics yesterday.  This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder. This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.  It appears you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.  They are E00982.4 &.5.  Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain in the butt. PL 
 QD7537.2 & .4 - #514468 PL

 IF-NNG TOK is a derived curve.  It is based off of IF WAHA TX.  That appears to have moved considerably in the last month.  Shout with any more questions.  Thanks. PL 
 please send this info to Shirley for Darron since he is out.  Thanks. PL 
 don't forget kam. PL 
 As Marina and I discussed this morning, accounting requests that we officialize several books weeks after they have been calced in order for them to run reports.  We do not officialize these post ids daily for two reasons: 1) The deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are captured in our transport model(not in ERMS).  If we were to officialize these post ids and report them on the VAR, we would then be only capturing half of the picture, since the transport model in our P&L is not in ERMS.  2) All of the deals in these books are book to book and do not involve third parties.  To keep this action from disrupting your group, the risk leads will forward an email to you when we officialize these post ids at accounting's request. The following is the list Rachel Crowell in Acctg. asked us to officialize on 3/12/01: 1054100 1054684 1054685 1054686 1054689 1055194 1055195 1055196  Please shout with any questions, thanks. PL 
 please verify none of these are ours. PL 
 Would you mind setting up an interview for us with Greg Thomas, resume attached below.  I think Dave Baumback, Kam Keiser, Errol McLaughlin, Darron Giron and myself need to interview him.  Groups of two at time would be preferred.  Thanks. PL 
 We do not maintain seperate book codes. PL 
 We do not keep inventory schedules on any of the central locations that you mentioned.  I am trying to get an inventory balance schedule that logistics keeps for NGPL.  I will let you know what I find out and how complete it is. PL

 Can you take a look at this and let me know what we officialized instead of these. PL

 I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward to anyone you think may be interested. PL  http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/madness/2001/brackets/men_printable.htm 
 FYI - those of you running firm books.  These adjustments described below are due to firm book PMA's we recieve from Tiffany Miller.  In the future, we need to put these in the appropriate schedules - C & E.  Schedule C should be used for MTM adjustments and Schedule E should be used for all other adjustments.  Shout with any questions. PL

 Slight changes - Make sure of course it is all on one page.  Check the spelling of herschel-navy records are in the floor of the office.  Should only need 10 copies or so.  Have mike and denise sent us the money for the room yet?  Tickets to Neville's? PL

 Sam- Here is a little something about my grandfather:  Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic Institute, now Auburn University.  He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years in Haleyville, Alabama.  Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 grandchildren and one great grandchild.

Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.  Dr Burgess was a World War II veteran.  Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and both grandchildren to school on the plains.  Due to his love for Auburn that he instilled in his family, there will defini
