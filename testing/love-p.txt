he months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 $105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this liquidation will offset. Take remaining $7K Thanks. PL 
 0009 Lone Liquidations: NU2698.2 is an EMW liquidation and goes with Sitara #359527, tsf this to the EMW line should clear both variances. We need to take the Phillip's liquidation just like 0010 - deal killed Desk will also take the remaining $1,500 variance PL 
 0010 Lone Liquidations: Phillips N45554.3 is a take to the desk, deal was killed in sitara PGL&C should be transferred to the Peoples desk - tagg has the book as FT-Peoples. Take remaining variance. PL 
 0011 Lone liquidation variances: CES-Dynegy - these tagg numbers are EFP deals and we had variances show up in forms and we should have used these to clear. ECS - this tagg number has a sitara deal - 309408 that did not flow.  The gas that was suppossed to flow on this deal, flowed on 310637 - Northern Natural.  This tagg should be part of that variance for settlements. Reliant Energy - that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed, sitara #456560, again, no variance to the desk. Move WPL variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to the desk.  Let me know if you need further info on this category. PL 
 Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for $265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks. PL 
 We will also take the interdesk variance for 0011 - $123K PL 
 looks like my boy. PL 
 We need to keep this for Jackson. PL 
 The feeling is mutual.  Things are going good, even better if I could get out of here at a decent time.  At least I don't have Susan's hours.  Are you coming to her happy hour tonight?  Talk to you soon. PL     Enron North America Corp. 
 Attached is the revised 0006 FRED please transfer the EMW items to the EMW line and settlements will have to resolve these issues.  Thanks. PL 
 All yours bro. PL 
 helps is I attach the damn thing. PL 
 Attached is the fred file.  On the recon variances tab, please note the liquidations coded in puke green, bright pink, blood red and blue.  These items will resolve our variance within 60K.  We will take the 60K expense. Please try and resolve those issues before close of 0201.  Let me know if you get resistance or need help.  Thanks. PL 
 Can either of the two distinguished Jim's from accounting help me with a financial liquidation problem from 0007.  I have a deal NR2989.1 that is showing up in my actuals for the beloved FRED file for this production month.  When I look at the deal in TAGG, the deal is an annuity booked to NG-Price.  I do not believe this should be in the central region.  Any assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had yesterday regarding financial liquidations.  Thanks for your help guys. Cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0007 for fin. liq. PL 
 As is the case will all FT-Ontario deals done at a US point, the deal must flow physically from a US book eventhough the canadian trader gets the long term income/loss from the deal.  This is a commercial decision that risk has to abide by.  The OA group, specifically John Valdes has given Jim Little the deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat performances.  This deal in question began in 11/00 and since you are doing december OA I would assume this one has not yet made the list.  I suggest forwarding to Jim LIttle/John Valdes to eliminate future problems.  Thanks. PL 
 FYI, Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.  The reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.  What typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes to the desk entirely at mid.  This is causing some substantial OA variances. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. 
 that is fine with me.  He said however that he will have an answer for me this morning. If he leaves we should definitely cancel. PL 
 Today's file looks good.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 No new deals for central desk since bid week. PL 
 Here is my groups book administrators.  If you need any further information, please let me know.  Thanks. PL 
 You can ask fabiola.  We are not in a bind we are still waiting on a few people to get back with us.  I think ashley was calling Monica and Jaime to see if they were interested and Ricky and Tanya.  The only bad thing is they have to let us know tomorrow if they are interested.  Sorry you are unable to make it, maybe next year. PL 
 FYI guys.  Save this stuff for after hours. PL 
 I got an update from Bryce.  In the back of the publication for 1/2/01(page 7), there are prices for the 30th & 31st.  It appears the 30th & 31st got pub posted at the first page of the 1/2/01 publication.  Therefore, we are going to see OA on these deals. PL 
 FYI, I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the central desk for december 2000.  It appears deals that are gas daily priced deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.  Two gas daily publications came out at the end of the year.  The publication on the 29th was for trans. dated the 28th and flowing the 29th.  The next gas daily publication  came out on the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans. 29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.  We flashed gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 2nd.  This is correct, we should pay sat. and sunday based on Monday's price.  Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.  I am going to give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.  If you disagree with my logic, please give me a shout. Thanks. PL 
 Hey girl, you guys figure out about Jazz Fest yet?  We have to pay for the rooms tomorrow.  I need to know ASAP.  Hope everything is going good. PL 
 looks like he has taken the picture down.  It sure was funny. PL 
 I have to say, I would be offended by that prayer too.  FYI, I will be in town this weekend(Haleyville).  We are packing up PaPa's stuff on Saturday if you want to come by and hang out.  Mom and I are probably going to head out Saturday afternoon.  Just a thought. PL 
 I just went to look at the file and the data is yesterday's data.  We need the current prices that are set each day at roughly 12:10 for the gas day of the next day.  Please let me know if this does not make sense.  Thanks. PL 
 FYI 
 I still have them and they are yours..as always, only stipulation is that I get to go in with you and get my free coke.  Still have not heard from your brother. PL 
 works for me. PL 
 Please mad GRLK/St. Clair to the same curve that TCPL/St. Clair GL is mapped, CGPR-St. Clair.  Thanks for your help. PL

 I did see that, I think they have him in a JC in Kansas.  Hopefully we will get him in two years. PL 
 Here is FT-Ontario's value for Co Energy.  Storey only had basis and index deals with them.  Please let me know if this format is not good for you. PL 
 I got Steve's email address.  Here it is: stevebonilla@yahoo.com  Good luck.  Stay in touch. PL 
 Please do this asap for your books.  I will check victor's books. Thanks. PL 
 Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our traders notebooks.  Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.  It is very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not always remind us that they did a deal late.  I spoke with hunter this morning and he wants these mistakes to stop.  This doesn't happen often, put it is very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 Please email me with requests for central deals.  Thanks. PL 
 Not too late, I have to pay for the rooms a week from today.  Hurry, hurry, Talk to you soon. PL 
 A Texas grad I work with found this on one of his alum sites.  The guy that put this out - Flea- is the auburn guy who runs thetigeronline.com.  Pretty funny. PL 
 Let me know if you have to change any of these. PL 
 I would say track it down with volume mgmt.  As far as I can tell, this deal ended 12/31/00. PL 
 Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and GD.  The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.  If you need any further information, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 I think I have 35,000 continental miles also.  I think that it is only 20,000 for a free flight.  You decide. PL 
 The $33.82 rate I was qouted was after tax.  I specifically asked this question on the phone and at the airport.  Not a good way to do business. PL 
 My groups survey should be there for January, I just finished.  Please let me know if you need any more information.  Thanks. PL 
 FYI.  We are under the mandate...no more screw ups. PL 
 Remove Scott Palmer from the list attached effective 2/15/01 and add Anna Kulic starting tomorrow. PL 
 These deals are not even on my desk.  All but the physical forward belong to the Price Desk.  the physical foward is a Texas desk deal.  You should contact the leads of those two risk groups - Errol McLaughlin and Dave Baumbach respectively.  Sorry I can't help. PL 
 Thanks for your prompt assistance with these books. PL 
 Brian McKnight isn't too bad either.  Although, overall, I was nto that impressed with the schedule this year for either weekend.  I wil however still have the best weekend of the year. PL 
 he is taking his.  There is a pc on the desk next to kam already. PL 
 I got this from elizabeth.  IF you really want to change the date let me know, it is scheduled for next Friday.  When the move occurs, we can take the PC on palmer's new desk and move it to mick's old desk.  I will move that. PL 
 Sitara #119378 is for all three N17872 legs and EY4000.2 is sitara #115203. THe remaining liquidation EY4008.2 should be a liq no flow.  The deal was killed. PL 
 I was just curious, thought Bill might need some, but I heard from him and he is good on tickets, so they are still yours for the taking. PL 
 EY3999.E is a northeast deal.  If you look in teh liquidation file under peoples sales, you will see this liquidation.  The point in tagg is a northeast point, so they will have the sitara number, the contact for you should be Kam Keiser. N18064.4 is sitara #116695. PL 
 sorry I forgot to reply.  I was at the gym for the first time in 3 years.  I really needed the workout.  I will be there next week.  Thanks. PL 
 you know i am always in need of some male bonding.  You guys decide if you want to go to Jazz Fest?  Do not forget about my mom's offer relating to said event.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 looks good to me. PL 
 that is ok.  Thanks for the update. PL 
 Please set up the two books attached.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks. PL 3-7376 
 FYI, you may see some January/February OA variances on Sithe due to these tagg numbers.  The sitara deal number involved is 543246.  Shout with any questions. PL 
 Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in Sithe's P&L.  1.  Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe Power QP7914.2.  Please settle this with January's physical purchase. 2.  Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's invoices. 3.  We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in  Schedule B in the FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).  A financial annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3). 4.  The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).  These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish the goals of your email below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 3-7376.  Thanks. PL     Enron North America Corp. 
 this is really funny. PL 
 what is the word on the tickets?  Have you heard from your older brother?  I think he is planning on spending the night at my house tomorrow, but I have not heard from him. PL 
 Sounds like fun man.  Do you ever do any bay fishing?  If you want to, let me know and I would love to go.  I like to wade fish so that I can use my fly rod.  I need to get my licensed renewed.  How much did you catch? PL 
 Where did you go fishing, offshore?  Who all went with you?  This company that you work for...is it named after your old girlfriend? PL 
 FYI, make sure the tab on your P&L file has been changed to match this=20 email.  This is really important since we are moving books around tonight. = =20 Thanks. PL 
 FYI 
 All of central books are done.  If you are missing any econ details, please let me know. PL 
 FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about unofficialized post id's.  We run a macro every night to verify these are officialized.  I just want to remind everyone that this is very important that we do this.  Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these errors continue.  Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on this currently.  Thanks. PL 
 Jim, would you mind setting up a meeting with the appropriate people so that we can get this resolved, I was assured by Misti Day the first week of December that this would be fixed.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 did this ever get resolved? PL 
 here are my changes, highlighted in yellow. PL 
 I will try and get it for you. PL 
 thanks for the update. PL 
 Please verify that all of these deals in your books have been flipped out. We should not have many.  Shout with any questions. PL 
 here is the information.  Make check payable to Auburn University Foundation, with a note or in memo that the gift is for a memorial for Dr. W.H. Burgess.  Mail the check to Auburn University c/o Sam Hendrix, Director of Development Vet. School 317 South College Street Auburn University, AL 36849  Thanks so much for your kindness, support and generosity. PL 
 Thanks for the thoughts.  Sorry it has taken me a few days, work has been really crazy.  Sounds like you are doing a little more travelling huh?  How do you like it?  I will keep your cell number and try and give you a call to talk in real life.  Looking forward to seeing you guys during easter. Hopefully we will not be heading to alabama for the weekend.  Talk to you soon.  Thanks again. PL 
 That's cool.  Elizabeth Soto actually was able to get me the tickets I needed. I was trying to cover the bases.  Thanks for trying.  How is everything else going?  Good I hope. PL 
 Thank you.  It means alot to have friends that are always willing to help. Everything gets better with time and I am definitely doing better this week. Thanks again for your thoughts. PL 
 FYI, I got a message from Elizabeth Hernanadez that we are missing a few of these sitara numbers in tagg when we are booking deals.  She fixed the ones we missed yesterday.  Please put these numbers in because it is vital to resolving OA variances that we are able to tie tagg deals to sitara. PL 
 Here is the information for the Endowment to share with Dr. Cashon.  The contact is Sam Hendrix, Director of Development School of Vetinary Medicine  Make the checks payable to Auburn University Foundation, with a note or write in memo - Memorial for Dr. W.H. Burgess  Mail check to Sam's attention: 317 South College Street Auburn University, AL 36849  Sam's phone number is 334-844-1446.  He said anyone can contact him at any time.  Let me know if you have anymore questions. PL 
 Man, I wish you could have made it to the reunion.  We had a really good time and it was good to see everybody.  What are you doing in Norway for a job?  I am still enjoying Enron.  I am headed to Auburn this weekend for our last home game of the season.  Should be fun.  If we make it over to Europe any time soon, we will look you up.  We will probably wait until Jackson is a little older so that he will enjoy it more.  How is your Pop doing?  I bet he hates having you so far away.  Did you purchase a new bronco when you got to Europe or have the old one shipped over?  Boy did we cruise in that thing. Stay in touch. PL 
 I have no seat for him until Feb 15th when Palmer leaves.  I will see what I can find out in terms of Kam moving. PL 
 After meeting with Larry Joe Hunter, we will not be granting tagg access to his group.  They were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the wrong counterparty.  The problem here lies in that they were wanting to do these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.  This is not an option.  Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.  We must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty initially.  Our credit risk exposure is the bottom line. If we do not have all the deals to the right counterparty each day, we may not be receiving enough money on Letter of Credit from CP's.  FYI, this is going to be a highly visible area for us to make mistakes.  If we continue to make these mistakes, we as a group will catch severe fire.  To help us do this correctly, Bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list on a monthlly basis.  We will still have emails sent denoting CP name changes, I reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future reference.  If all else fails and there is something you are not sure about, please call Bianca Ornelas at  5-3782.  If you have any questions, please give me a shout.  Thanks. PL 
 Let's hope he qualifies.  That could be a game breaker. PL 
 check this out.  Hopefully he will qualify. PL 
 Do you have an updated status on this issue?  Thanks. PL 
 I deleted the file. PL 
 Tell you what Chad, you win.  I really am tired of banging my head against a wall talking to an irrational person.  I was not trying to make fun of your school, you chose that route.  I was trying to make a simple point that recruiting at Enron does not make a school elite.  Does NASA recruit at LSU? Does IBM?  Who cares? The point once again, we were talking about SPORTS!!!! See you in Baton Rouge in September.  Go ahead and respond, so that way you have the "last word". 
 This should have been cc to you.  I think development made a mistake and cc carrie hollomon 
 Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas cards.  How is married life treating you?  Good I hope.  What are you guys doing for Christmas?  Are your folks coming in?  We are staying in Houston.  Should be nice and quiet.  We are going to have a few people over for new year's, but nothing special. PL 
 I plan on attending. PL 
 Did you not hear me.  I said I was talking athletics.  Do you want me to break out academics with you?  I will be more than happy to discuss Auburn. Top 15 schools for your money, US News & World Report.   Behind the service academies, more astronauts than any other university.  Top ten among universities in terms of fortune 500 CEO's, Fortune Magazine.  The point, don't try and act like LSU is the best school in the land.  Just because Enron doesn't recruit at some schools, doesn't mean they are inferior academically.  I would much rather have a degree from Tulane than LSU or Auburn, in terms of academic stature.  You should know that recruiting at Enron has and will always be political.  You have to have someone from that school in upper managment request trips be made.  I can promise you in the next 2-3 years they will be recruiting at Auburn.  I and anothe alum have already discussed it with HR. PL 
 I responded, I just did not copy anyone. PL 
 Please do not try and compare Louisiana to Alabama.  There is only one university in Louisiana.  You can not hold it against Auburn that Napoleonville has only been able to support one university.  Tulane is strictly academics and we are talking sports. PL 
 Chad, do you even know what is coming out of your mouth?  When did you become such a football expert?  I recall Blanchard and the boys having to teach you about the game. 
 touchy,touchy.  seems like the frustration of three straight top 5 recruiting classes with nothing to show for it are getting to you.  It will be ok. Hopefully Mack can get some coaching in their to go with his powers of persuasion. PL 
 FYI, please also know that if the change is simply a meter change, that does not effect the value.  Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the value. Thanks again. PL 
 Your just pissed because I was right about that recruit all along. PL 
 You might try Kathy Kelly. PL 
 I have no knowledge of the change, it does not affect me.  Sorry I am unable to help. PL 
 I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks. PL 
 can you provide me with a deal number to check into this matter? PL 
 your so poetic, please continue to share with me your true feelings, it only increases my opinion of LSU alums. 
 once again, keep your mouth shut til you beat my team.  You have not proved anything yet. PL 
 You should enjoy this article. PL 
 Here is an article for all you LSU boys who kept saying Tuberville was leaving. PL 
 this is the kid from opelika correct?  I heard when he committed last week, all the publications took him from a 5 star to four star.  SOunds like a little biased alabama propaganda.  I talked with the guy at the vet school today about donations in PaPa's name.  He was telling me to call him anytime I am down there and he will get us a tour of the eagle's new digs and the entire raptor center.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Let me know if you are interested during football season. PL 
 thanks for your help. PL 
 check this out...next time check your sources. http://rivals100.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=135&p=2&stid=8101251 
 All done. PL 
 FYI, a note from the top.  If you need help, let me know. PL 
 I agree with that totally.  Jeff should we get a meeting set up with LaGrasta to discuss this with him.  Please let me know your thoughts. PL 
 FYI,  I have been notified by Hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind. So, please verify your P&L's nightly for accuracy, mainly curve shift and new deal problems.  Curve shift reports should be run for all of your P&L's and new deals should be tied out before calcing.  I know you guys almost always do this, I am just giving you a friendly reminder since Hunter is going to be watching us even closer now.  Also, please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra month trader.  I also heard this request from Hunter.  Thanks again for everything while I was out and keep up the good work. PL 
 We have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated properly to ensure entry into TAGG & Sitara for prompt month deals.  Would you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines on other desks.  For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page.  This would simply be an additional step to verify all deals are being captured.  Hopefully this will eliminate any future problems.  If you have any suggestions for ways to better handle this, please let me know.  Thanks. PL 
 Can we go ahead and take the unexplained amount (numbers at the bottom of your schedule) for Ontario thru 0008.  It appears that the number will be roughly 25K in income, making the number 255K unexplained and that will be for the months 0009-0011.  Can we also do the same on Central through 0006, this will be roughly 56K in expenses.  This will clean up that as well.  Please shout if there are any problems.  Thanks. PL 
 The room is $440 per couple for the four nights or $220 per person.  The fest tickets are $15 a day and people usually go 2 of the three days.  there is also a Harrah's casino across the street from our condo.  The condo's have kitchen's in them so people and buy groceries and stuff and eat there mainly.  We go every year and have a blast.  If you are interested let me know. PL 
 have you heard  anything from Jim on these?  How are we looking on back pages?  Let me know and I can take some time with you to help and clean them up further.  Thanks. PL 
 Will you cehck this out and see if it is for real?  Also, did you talk to the day care about watchmegrow.com? PL 
 Has then been fixed yet?  Thanks for the Jesse joke, pretty funny. PL 
 Sure. PL 
 Thanks for your wishes and I am confident all your prayers helped me get through the weekend.  Thanks again for your kind words. PL 
 using the wrong head I think.  According to the official Jazz Fest website, there are only 87 days till Fest 2001.  Harrah's!! Harrah's!!  Harrah's!! PL 
 Sorry it has taken me a few days to get back with you, I had to leave town unexpectedly and just returned today.  All of that sounds great, how about putting the file in the O drive under erms/1intra/central.  Please name the file EOL curves.  Please let me know if you have any problems.  Thanks for your help on this matter. PL 
 Sounds good to me.  We just wanted to invite you guys anyway.  We look forward to seeing you in April.  My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the funeral on Saturday.  I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.  I bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my emotions.  I hope I never have to do that again.  Thanks for your thoughts. I actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it.  Wild huh?  Talk to you soon. PL 
 FYI. PL 
 Thanks VIc. PL 
 looks good to me.(steve talked to me about him). PL 
 Thanks for the invite.  Unfortunately, I have to go out of town tonight unexpectedly.  Have fun. PL 
 I have no idea, I went and early voted.  Have fun standing in line.  Call Paul Bettencourt - Tax Assessor's office. PL 
 Thanks.  I think we have everything covered.  We are taking Jackson, I believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.  If you guys want to bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other kids his age to play with.  Talk to you next week. PL 
 I have also been meaning to email you.  Unfortunately, I do not have much time to talk with you, I have to head out to alabama unexpectedly, my gradfather is pretty ill.  We were wondering if you guys might want to go to Jazz fest.  THe dates are 4/226-4/30(thurs. arrival, monday departure).  We have about 5 couples going right now and the room rate is $440 per couple for all four nights total.  Let me know if you are interested, we have to have the rooms paid for by 2/15/01.  Talk to you soon.  Thanks. PL 
 FYI...please for my sanity, lets try and keep these to a minimum in the future.  Thanks. PL  P.S.  Thanks in advance for all of your help for me today and tomorrow. 
 FYI PL 
 For future months, please add Bruce Mills to this list.  He is the book admin for FT-Cent and GD-Central.  Thanks. PL 
 Andres just got the ticket this morning, he is putting it in as we speak. Thanks. PL 
 That was nice!!!  I forgot what your reply was, do you need any of the two extra tickets I have for Saturday?  Thanks. PL 
 Pretty damn funny. PL 
 This is one of andres' deals, can you help it do the calc sheet scott? PL 
 Please add Victor Guggenheim to your list.  Thanks for the email.  FYI, I am sure that Fletch and Martin appreciate your email last night as well. PL 
 Good to see.  Thanks for forwarding. PL 
 This deal is ok for now because it only has a volume in for January.  If the trader changes the volume for the out months, we will need to have it in tagg.  thanks. PL 
 I suggest not watching this after eating or drinking too much. PL 
 Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help. PL 
 I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk. Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me for any additional information or if this is really confusing.  Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter. Phillip 3-7376 
 guess it helps to attach the file. PL 
 Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central 1 & Central 2.  The total page should tie to what I gave you last week.  I highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.  I then attached those days P&L top sheets.  Please review this information and let us know what type of detailed support you will need.  Thanks. PL 
 Thought you might want some late breaking news. PL 
 Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.  Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 FYI, all new deals that are at NGPL/Nipsco, need to be in sitara at Nipsco/NGPL.  Please shout with any questions. PL 
 These two deals, 249262 & 565833 are changed for February out.  I will tell the risk team that all new deals at NGPL/Nipsco should be at NIPS/NGPL - 9260.  Is this correct? PL 
 I did not see the two sitara numbers on the email.  Please send me the numbers and I will change them now. Thanks. PL 
 What are you doing home in the middle of the day? PL 
 I forgot to tell you last night, Ginger called and said Tori will be there. I thought there were possibly going to be other kids there as well.  What about just going out to eat at Lupe's with your mom and nonnie?  That sounds good to me.  We do not have to have a party with Brian/Rebecca, Kim and Ev and then they feel obligated to bring a gift.  No big deal to me and I am sure no big deal to them.  What are we doing for dinner tonight?  PL 
 That is all fine with me.  Just ask mom what she wants to do.  She will not flip out again, I think.  We can see if she wants to do anything on his actual birthday.  What are we going to actually do after the Gymboree thing, are we inviting anyone else over? PL 
 FYI - Barry was not there last week. PL 
 Here are a list of TAGG3's that were already linked: QB6244.1 QB6277.1 QB6303.1 QB8815.1 QC2276.1  If you have any questions are need help with this, please let me know. Thanks for your help. PL 
 Here was my original response to her.  Joe Hunter is fine with me. PL 
 I have a few concerns about this.  We are suppossed to be the only point of contact for changes in tagg.  This is an internal control issue that leaves all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk.  If other people are touching deals in tagg, any errors will then have to be investigated further and thus take longer to resolve.  I guess my main question for you is, does a problem exist in the current system?  Is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis?  If so, we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner.  Please let me know if the others disagree with me.  Thanks. PL 
 I already have access. PL 
 sounds like a great plan.  Talk to you more about it tonight. PL 
 FYI. 
 Please add me to this list.  I am replacing Kam on the Central desk, she is moving to the east desk. PL 
 I just wanted to update you guys on the status of the EMW reports for Hunter.  The EMW Positions_1 file is now updated and accurate.  Every night when Kevin finishes his P&L file and updates the EMW Positions file, he will email the entire central team.  If one of us is still here, we can print out the necessary reports and leave them on Hunter's desk.  If no one is here, the first person in will need to print these reports out and give them to Hunter with the Var report.  For the time being Hunter will be the only one needing these reports, I will communicate any change in distribution that he requests.  Also for the time being, we will be going into Kevin's P&L file, which is in the same location as our intra month P&L's that we sign off on, and printing the four tabs that he has identified in the email attached.  When Hunter has time to review this format with me, we may make changes to the reports we print out.  The EMW positions_1 file is in the same location as our CE Positions_1 file.  Please as always, shout with any questions or concerns.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 I have not seen the increased volumes.  I will ask andy tomorrow about them. The original 13K and 30 K are in Sitara. PL 
 Please send me more information on book G5.  The person that runs that book, FTOC, is not aware of this book.  Please send me the book name and we will try and track it down.  FYI, please send all future Central desk/Ontario desk inquires to me.  Kam has moved to the East desk and I am now the lead for the Central.  Thanks for your help. PL 3-7376 
 Jim, Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog. This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.  The Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510. Please shout with any questions.  Jennifer, this should eliminate the current outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have been cleaned up.  The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.  I believe the variances will be a gain. Thanks for you help guys. PL 3-7376 
 Not so fast buddy.  Check out this article.  http://www.al.com/sports/birmingham/?Jan2001/16-e415212b.html 
 Thanks for the good words, hope to see you in Vegas.  Stay out of trouble. PL 
 You are right about one thing....it seems there is never a time when we are not busy here..  With the job change, my work schedule just got worse.  Sorry if I sounded wierd, did not mean too, I am sure it was just htat I was in a hurry.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 Looks correct to me Dawnie. PL 
 Please add my name to this email if you continue to send this file out. Thanks. PL 
 Darron talked the higher ups here into making me the business controller for the Central desk.  So now my hours are longer and responsibility greater all for the same pay.  I guess I did n't have to do the stupid thing and accept, but oh well.  We will see if I can handle another year in risk.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 Guess this should not come as a suprise to us.  Unfortunately, rumor has it today Dubose will be fired. PL 
 Who in the hell is getting married in Cabo? That sure is different.  You will have to go to Jazz fest with us next year.  Just let me know.  We reserve the extra rooms around Jan. and have to pay for them by Feb. 15th.  How is your new job going?  I am staying too damn busy here, Darron got me in all kinds of trouble.  See you in Vegas. PL 
 Attached are the files you requested from the central desk.  Please add my name to your email list for P&L requests.  I am now the lead for the Central desk.  Thanks.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to give me a shout. PL 3-7376 
 I was out of town this past week and did not get back until Saturday night. Sorry I missed your call.  What was the outcome on the game saturday?  I will try and make it to practice tonight.  I have a new job at Enron that keeps me here most night until 8 p.m. or so. PL 
 Congratulations.  I thought you said you were done after one?  I am sure your son will absolutely love having someone to play with.  I just got back from a week off, so I am swamped.  I am now the business controller for our desk, so I have reviews and a million other things to catch up on.  We will have to chat later. PL 
 Ya nknow, every year it is the same thing with you guys....we are going to dominate....we are the best.  The problem is you never deliver. PL 
 Sounds great.  We will have to meet up somewhere.  We are staying at the NY,NY under my name.  I feel the same.  I really enjoy seeing you, but as usual, the visits are too short.  We will just have to make more frequent trips to Denver.  I will write more later, trying to get caught up from a week off.  Jackson did get the gift for Christmas from you, the thank you card should be in the mail.  Thanks. PL  PL 
 I just got back in the office from a week off, so I am catching up this morning.  I will unfortunately be unable to attend your meeting this morning.  I need to try and get prepared for the afternoon meeting.  Thanks. PL 
 maybe you guys can finally beat us now that we have so many guys going to the pros.  What the hell is Booty thinking?  Any one that drafts him has got to be a fool.  I guess he saw the writing on the wall that Rohan would be getting the PT. PL 
 Aren't you LSU boys starting your usual shit talking a little early this year?  When you can finally beat my school in football then I will start listening to your BS.  FYI, those guys leaving has been helping our recruiting. PL 
 Hey man, check this out.  I have planned the same trip.  We are actually going in on Wednesday night - the 14th.  We are staying at NY,NY.  We will have to hook up.  Rachel Bonilla and her husband are going to be there as well that weekend.  Should be fun. PL 
 The trees in the bed should be fine.  Just the azaleas and the garlic. PL 
 Thanks for the pics. PL 
 We leave here Thursday April, 26th and return Monday April 30th.  What are your plans? PL

 I will be on vacation but will be there the next week. PL 
 thanks for the tip PL 
 Per Bass- like last year we get 13 guys, one must remain on IR for the entire week. Note - the person does not have to be injured.  Pickups and drops are every monday.  If you do not know how to add/drop, ask any of us from last year. PL 
 works for me! PL 
 GEAUX  TIGERS!!!  Stock up on those Sharpies!!  http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/2000/bowl_projections/  PL 
 Now it is on...bring it Bass.  The PLove is back to sew up this league like I am doing in football.  Come down my way and hand over my share of this week's pot.  I guess I will get the pool again this week since I am playing you, the only one with a chance to outscore me. PL 
 By the way....Do you need any tickets for the Georgia game?  I think I will have two extra.  Let me know.  Thanks. PL 
 HEAD!!  PANTS!! NOW!!  That boy's cranium should is a virtual planetoid..It should have it's own weather system.  That was low, the poor boy will probably cry himself to sleep on his large pillow.  Great flick. PL 
 I figured you would come back with that.  Did he ever marry that charger doll or whatever they are called or did she wise up to the scam? PL 
 Speaking of chargers, when is Ryan Leaf going to be stoned to death in the town square? PL
