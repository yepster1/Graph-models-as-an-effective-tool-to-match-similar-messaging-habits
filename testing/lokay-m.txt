 Hope you are feeling better!  I took my last day of vacation on Wednesday, Dec 26.  I was even here and on call for New Year's! 
 Approved.  Please increase, on Amendment #4, the West Texas receipts from 14,265 to 18,000 effective Nov 2002-Feb 2003.  This will still leave a balance of 2,000 at the "East of Thoreau" area.  The Red Rock administration contract will also need to be adjusted.  Thanks.

 Yes, I will keep you posted.  They have another level of approval left.  If that happens, we will receive either check or wire. 
 Approved.  Amendment to increase TQ by 10,000 for 2 days. 
 This is the San Juan to San Juan contract, with alternates out of the path.  Same as December. 
 FYI.  Section 13(h) does state 3 months prior to expiration and 07/31/02 is 3 months before 10/31/02.

 Happy Holidays!      Dear Tech Support,  Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.  Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do?  Desperate  > >---------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear Desperate,  First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.  Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.  DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.  In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.  Good luck.

 What do you think of this itinerary?  You guys would leave San Antonio and pick us up at Hobby for the same flight to Orlando.  On the return trip, we leave 1 1/2 hours before you, but you guys have a direct flight.  The trip is Friday through Saturday, for 8 nights.

 This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the "View Printable Page," that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

 Hi Teresa, Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for my directory information.  It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage instead of Enron Corporation.  Thanks and talk to you soon! 
 Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan and I are going to be on vacation in California.  Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs!

 Guys: I've narrowed the list down to the minimum combination of packages.  Please build all receipts to all deliveries except for Same Combos (Oasis-Oasis, etc.) or any Pool-Pool Combos.  Thanks. 
 Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board. Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput information; but, I will see if there is another source. 
 Just wanted you to know...

 Please increase the contract TQ from 350 to 500 effective 02/01/2001. Thanks. 
 Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

 Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension. Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can exercise her ROFR. 
 Count me in, if still available.  Thanks! 
 Good. 
 Hi Mike,  Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!  How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much shorter!  Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?! 
 FYI...I am scheduled for Jury Duty next Monday, August 14. 
 Met with Lee Hart.  Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday. Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.  Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural take or pay case.  Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).  They are also interested in the auctioned capacity. 
 Vacation week of July 31- August 4.  Jury Duty on August 14.  Thanks. 
 FYI... 
 Completed an IT agreement with CIMA Energy, who owns 5000/day production on the Crawford lateral.  Gas will be transported to both the Willi Wick Farm Tap in the Texas panhandle area as well as to the West Texas pool.  The agreement is at 0.065 cents, plus fuel for 14 months beginning Sept 2000. This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue (currently shipped under a Duke FT for 0.02).

 Great Expectations Forbes - 10/16/2000 BY Lynn Cook Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.  ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail.  The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover.  Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet connections to its iPAQ Pocket. 
 Azurix Water. 
 Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25. They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today. 
 Documentation for the Southern to BP Energy contract assignments. 
 FYI..assignment request from Southern Company. 
 FYI...I spoke with Craig Carley at Reliant this morning.  On contract #22538, there was not a discount requested therefore September was at Max Rate.  For October, I told him the spreads are still above Max Rate and he is in agreement.  November...hmmm...above Max Rate?!?! 
 FYI...assignment or capacity release? 
 FYI...please continue processing Assignments. 
 No vacation or sick time off.  Thanks. 
 done.

 How about somewhere in between?  Where's Danetta?  Maybe Treebeards in Interfirst Plaza?

 Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!  The reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 FYI... 
 I will be taking Vacation this afternoon.  Thanks.

 EOG interconnect is finishing this week and will be in service by this weekend.  It will initially flow 8-10000/day and will increase to over 15000. 
 In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc. Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from Accounts Receivable. 
 Do you know  about the variable costs?  I don't think any of the Park and Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability?!?! 
 Please approve. 
 Key bullets for 2000 accomplishments and 2001 goals:  Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum rate for California deliveries.  Contract also includes provision for Marketing Fee if contract is ever released above max rate. Completed new interconnect with EOG for additional 15,000/day.  Potential opportunity for future transport agreement. Settled dispute with Burlington involving volume commitments under various pipeline pressures. Working with SPS and ePrime on potential power plant interconnect. Working as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system. Working with Accounts Receivable to resolve outstanding reimbursable projects.

 FYI...since you guys weren't on the distribution list. 
 Conoco, Burlington, and Oneok have all expressed an interest in participating in the Open Season... 
 FYI...we did it!  Over the first 6 days, they averaged over 25,000. 
 I'm sorry!  I was out of the office for a memorial service on Friday, November 10.  How do I write that off?  FYI, I will be in all this week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).   Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 I am free any of these days...my preference is either Thursday or Friday! 
 Market Services are the schedulers (Cynthia, Amy, Burt, Linda Ward, Terry, etc.)...how about Contract Administration (Elizabeth Brown, Dale Eldridge)? 
 Got them.  They're beautiful...thanks! 
 If you're ordering from Corporate Express, this might help you.   Weekly #AAG21952, Monthly #AAG21904.  I couldn't tell from the picture if they were blue, though.  Can you verify? 
 OK.  Mine is updated...FYI, I had to still use the U versus N drive! 
 Revenue Generating: Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at max tariff rate for California deliveries; generating $2.7 million in revenue.  Included was a sharing mechanism providing an opportunity to generate market based transport. Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 35,000/day of supply on east end of system. Executed pooling agreement with Cima Energy to become a new customer on Transwestern, providing 5-10,000/day of incremental supply on TW's system.  Non-Revenue: Settled dispute with Burlington that could have cost $3 million dollars; negotiated potential damages down to $100,000 and eliminating future potential dollar exposure. Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices. Located over $600,000 on Northern. Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system. System now is also linked with the Risk Management System with weekly basis quote feed to ensure more real time data. 
 Count me in... 
 The numbers look good! 
 I was out the afternoon of Tuesday, November 28.  Thanks. 
 Sure, let's talk.

 Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!! Yes, let's allget together soon...call me!  Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one? 
 What do you think?  If we forward this, I think this needs to be cleaned up.
