 Let's discuss this prior to billing.  I agree that ENA owes us money, but there were certain conditions agreed to before we could get this capacity back!...

 Approved.  Please increase, on Amendment #4, the West Texas receipts from 14,265 to 18,000 effective Nov 2002-Feb 2003.  This will still leave a balance of 2,000 at the "East of Thoreau" area.  The Red Rock administration contract will also need to be adjusted.  Thanks.

 Yes, I will keep you posted.  They have another level of approval left.  If that happens, we will receive either check or wire. 
 Approved.  Amendment to increase TQ by 10,000 for 2 days. 
 This is the San Juan to San Juan contract, with alternates out of the path.  Same as December. 
 FYI.  Section 13(h) does state 3 months prior to expiration and 07/31/02 is 3 months before 10/31/02.

 Happy Holidays!      Dear Tech Support,  Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.  Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do?  Desperate  > >---------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear Desperate,  First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.  Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.  DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.  In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.  Good luck.
