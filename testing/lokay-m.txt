 Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension. Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can exercise her ROFR. 
 Count me in, if still available.  Thanks! 
 Good. 
 Hi Mike,  Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!  How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much shorter!  Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?! 
 FYI...I am scheduled for Jury Duty next Monday, August 14. 
 Met with Lee Hart.  Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday. Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.  Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural take or pay case.  Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).  They are also interested in the auctioned capacity. 
 Vacation week of July 31- August 4.  Jury Duty on August 14.  Thanks. 
 FYI... 
 Completed an IT agreement with CIMA Energy, who owns 5000/day production on the Crawford lateral.  Gas will be transported to both the Willi Wick Farm Tap in the Texas panhandle area as well as to the West Texas pool.  The agreement is at 0.065 cents, plus fuel for 14 months beginning Sept 2000. This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue (currently shipped under a Duke FT for 0.02).

 How are you?  I was just thinking of you guys and wanted to say "hi"!!! 
 Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out otherwise, let me know!  Thanks.     Ginger McCain                06/30/2000 09:56 AM

 Great Expectations Forbes - 10/16/2000 BY Lynn Cook Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.  ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail.  The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover.  Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet connections to its iPAQ Pocket. 
 Azurix Water. 
 Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25. They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today. 
 Documentation for the Southern to BP Energy contract assignments. 
 FYI..assignment request from Southern Company. 
 FYI...I spoke with Craig Carley at Reliant this morning.  On contract #22538, there was not a discount requested therefore September was at Max Rate.  For October, I told him the spreads are still above Max Rate and he is in agreement.  November...hmmm...above Max Rate?!?! 
 FYI...assignment or capacity release? 
 FYI...please continue processing Assignments. 
 No vacation or sick time off.  Thanks. 
 done. 
 FYI 
 How about somewhere in between?  Where's Danetta?  Maybe Treebeards in Interfirst Plaza?

 Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!  The reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 FYI... 
 I will be taking Vacation this afternoon.  Thanks. 
 Count me in for either Monday or Tuesday.  Thanks!

 EOG interconnect is finishing this week and will be in service by this weekend.  It will initially flow 8-10000/day and will increase to over 15000. 
 In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc. Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from Accounts Receivable. 
 Do you know  about the variable costs?  I don't think any of the Park and Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability?!?! 
 Please approve. 
 Key bullets for 2000 accomplishments and 2001 goals:  Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum rate for California deliveries.  Contract also includes provision for Marketing Fee if contract is ever released above max rate. Completed new interconnect with EOG for additional 15,000/day.  Potential opportunity for future transport agreement. Settled dispute with Burlington involving volume commitments under various pipeline pressures. Working with SPS and ePrime on potential power plant interconnect. Working as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system. Working with Accounts Receivable to resolve outstanding reimbursable projects. 
 See below.... 
 FYI...since you guys weren't on the distribution list. 
 Conoco, Burlington, and Oneok have all expressed an interest in participating in the Open Season... 
 FYI...we did it!  Over the first 6 days, they averaged over 25,000. 
 I'm sorry!  I was out of the office for a memorial service on Friday, November 10.  How do I write that off?  FYI, I will be in all this week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).   Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 I am free any of these days...my preference is either Thursday or Friday! 
 Market Services are the schedulers (Cynthia, Amy, Burt, Linda Ward, Terry, etc.)...how about Contract Administration (Elizabeth Brown, Dale Eldridge)? 
 Got them.  They're beautiful...thanks! 
 If you're ordering from Corporate Express, this might help you.   Weekly #AAG21952, Monthly #AAG21904.  I couldn't tell from the picture if they were blue, though.  Can you verify? 
 OK.  Mine is updated...FYI, I had to still use the U versus N drive! 
 Revenue Generating: Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at max tariff rate for California deliveries; generating $2.7 million in revenue.  Included was a sharing mechanism providing an opportunity to generate market based transport. Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 35,000/day of supply on east end of system. Executed pooling agreement with Cima Energy to become a new customer on Transwestern, providing 5-10,000/day of incremental supply on TW's system.  Non-Revenue: Settled dispute with Burlington that could have cost $3 million dollars; negotiated potential damages down to $100,000 and eliminating future potential dollar exposure. Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices. Located over $600,000 on Northern. Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system. System now is also linked with the Risk Management System with weekly basis quote feed to ensure more real time data. 
 Count me in... 
 The numbers look good! 
 I was out the afternoon of Tuesday, November 28.  Thanks. 
 Sure, let's talk. 
 Two contract's ROFR notification expired this week (11/30/2000).  These contracts will terminate next year 11/30/2001.  Burlington with 15000 Ignacio to Blanco and PG&E with 20000 Blanco to EOT. Eprime signed a 50000/day park and ride agreement effective 12/01/2000. Current posted rates are at max of .3883. Invoices are going out next week.  Included is the Burlington credit of $83000 in prior period adjustments. 
 Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!! Yes, let's allget together soon...call me!  Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one? 
 What do you think?  If we forward this, I think this needs to be cleaned up.

 Offered ePrime FT.....5 cents East to East (ie, Tumbleweed and Oasis) with alternate firm to Needles at Permian-SoCal Gas Daily differential less fuel, then splitting profits TW 75% and ePrime 25%. Working with Bob Burleson with SPS power plant connection.  Offered ePrime (the gas managers and affiliate of SPS) a .03 cent transport rate from Oasis to the new proposed interconnect (Panhandle leg) in exchange for volume commitment of 3 bcfs over 5 years.  ePrime is planning on using the transport for loads during the 4 peaking summer months. Analyzed West flow transport contracts for future expiration dates without ROFR extentions.  Putting together list of details for solicitation, allowing us to sell and hedge higher transport rates and taking advantage of current market spreads
