you check for me .  Harry 
 Greg, I would love to do that. My location is 3121.   Harry 
 Rob   We need some-one from the trading desk to interview for associate analyst program. You may not be particularly excited, but I did suggest your name for the Super saturday on Nov 3rd.  Hope you can work it in your schedule. If it does not work for you, lets chat about it tomorrow.   Harry 
 Dave  I had a great time last evening.  Do you have a personal email address ?   Harry 
 Karen  I suggested Rob  take my position on Saturday, looks like instead of replacing my spot with him, you just added him. Could you pls take me off ?   Harry 
 Woody  Did this include any ICAP ? Do we have any idea of who is bidding that one ? I think we need to frame a reverse RFP on this one to see if we could get some-one to buy 4.50$ without the congestion.   Harry 
 Sure 
 Karen   Just to confirm, I am not doing these interviews.   Harry 
 My mistake, I am good for Thursday.   Harry 
 Hi Roy   Good to hear from you.  I am glad to hear things are going well. This consolidation in the markets and the economy has been quite severe. I can tell you it has not been fun working with a 50 multiple company either as the p/e contracts to 7.  But nevertheless this had been interesting times.  We ramped down DealBench in good time. It was a good decision and precipitated some good thinking. Practically, everyone moved out of ecommerce. Its just crazy when you think how things were 18 months ago. . Power trading has been immensely interesting. I am running the options desk and we have had a decent year.  Energy trading is fascinating and coupled with my macro background from bond trading,it becomes lot of fun.  Say hi to Loreli. Do let me have your Hong Kong phone number.   Harry
