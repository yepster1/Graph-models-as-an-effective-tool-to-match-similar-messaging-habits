 How does 3 pm look ? 
 Jocelyn  New Power Company and Azurix are other affiliate companies of Enron. EDS is a totally different company, to which we have outsourced some stuff - so they have a number of employees on our premises ( on EDS contract).  I personally do not work out at the bodyshop. So would be unable to help you on how it might be in the morning.  I am sure you can call the BodyShop and they can help you out.  If you have questions, our HR co-ordinator (Lauren or Ben) should be able to provide further assistance.   Harry
