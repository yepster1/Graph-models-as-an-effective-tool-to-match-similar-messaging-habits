th a short list of questions on the project.  Jim is also waiting on feedback from TECO on our proposal.  kh 
 good analysis-- maybe you should consider a new career as an ESPN sports commentator.  Who knows, it might pay pretty good.  thanks kh 
 thanks 
 i am still interested but the level of interest will depend on cost. kh 
 Price would be $1150 + tax, he has one in stock.  Ship time is usually 3-5 days. 
 Russ-- Attached for your review is the confidential proposed Term Sheet for Transwestern's Sun Devil Project.  As we discussed, it includes a 20% swing capability for Duke within a 24 hour period plus delivery capability to Cal Border.  After you've had a chance to review, please call me and we can address any questions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you later this week.  Hope you are enjoying the snow!!!

 I purchased an XTM Outlaw for my son for Xmas.  I need replacement front suspension arms (that the long pin goes thru) and my local dealer doesn't have the parts in stock.  How do I get the replacements?  thanks  Kevin Hyatt 18715 Hickory Ashe Drive Humble, TX  77346 kevin.hyatt@enron.com 
   Also, do you make a longer / wider front bumper? 
 That's very good!!!  I can't imagine the struggle you face everyday.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. 
 I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.  A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.  Many of these people sacrificed some of their own Christmas so that kids at Gordon Elementary would not be let down.  I would like them to know that their efforts were truly appreciated by the students, faculty, and especially those of us on the Committee.  Would you please consider posting on your site the attached thank-you letter from the school?  thank you Kevin Hyatt Co-Chair Enron Kids Committee 2001

 Hi Don-- I picked up one of your flyers.  I'm looking for storage for my 2000 Expedition to hold hunting equipment.  What configurations do you have?  Also, would you be willing to sell the plans (copyrighted of course).  I have a pretty extensive wood shop and might want to make the box myself.  thanks Kevin Hyatt 281-852-6590 
 Tony, call Rebekah at the number below. kh 
 Doug-- We are working up a proposal for APS in Phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the project's FERC application ready.  Tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of $8,750,301.  Is this still a good number to use for our APS proposal?  Let's talk Wed 1/23 if possible.  thanks kh x35559 
 It was nice to meet you at the Sempra dinner last week.  We got 8 ducks on Sunday morning, but lost 2.  We should've downed about 3 more.  Can you go next Wed morning 12/19? 
 Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option. 
 is this form on-line?  If so, how do I get to it.  It doesn't appear under "forms" on HRweb. thanks Kevin Hyatt x35559 
 thanks Jean!!! 
   Kevin, attached is the Sun Devil powerpoint presentation we gave to Stan back in December.  I added one slide since called Project Rationale.  The document probably has more detail than you need but more is better right?  Let me know if you need help cutting it down. 
 Can you tell me where to find the FASB 92 and 71 descriptions? thanks

 The Sun Devil model is pretty big, over 2000kb, I'm not sure how well it will email but we can try it.  We may want to send a backup on a 100mb zip drive disk.  Do they have the ability to read the zip disk?

 I sent the model that matches up with the information we have already submitted to them.

   I looked over the entire list.  It amazes me what some people got, including those in my group. 
 depending on how things shake out with sun devil this week, I'd like to tentatively plan on taking this Friday 2/15 off.  Let me know if there's a problem.  thanks kh 
 I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):  1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.  Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?  2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC  APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility). 
 If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?  How early?  regards, kevin 
 Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.  The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.  thanks kh 
 David, glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?  It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.  stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you. Kevin 
  It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?  I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.  Hope you and Daphne are doing well.  take care, Kevin Hyatt 
 EB 1336 
 it just goes to show you, GOD is a first a Husker fan, then a Notre Dame fan!!!!!!! 
 a recruiter friend of mine suggested you contact leadersonline.com if you haven't already.  kh 
 I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  How do I get them comfortable? Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when? Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?  Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.  khyatt 
   Paul, here's the open season on our Sun Devil project designed to meet the growing needs of the Phoenix electric generation market.  Please feel free to call me with any questions.  thanks, Kevin Hyatt Director, Pipeline Business Development 713-853-5559 
 OK!!!!! thanks 
  Kevin, please review the attached and add any details you feel are necessary.  I'd like to send this to Arizona Public Service on Tuesday 2/12.  thanks, khyatt 
 thanks, that looks great! 
 Dear Curt-- thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions. 
 Geneva, see the document below for the music system bid.  Call me and let's discuss.  kh 
 it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around. 
 contact Nova Guides in Minturn, Colo 970-827-4232  have fun!!!!!!!!!!
