 Carrie Mr. Colin Wilkes from General Electric Power Systems has agreed to present for NGI Session C on 3/20.  He will cover two topics including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and "Pressure Reliability".  He is preparing his initial draft which should be available in the next two weeks.  Please forward to him a conference invitation at your earliest convenience.  Contact info is as follows:  Mr. Colin Wilkes General Electric Building 40, Room 517 1 River Road Schenectady, NY  12345 518-385-7538  colin.wilkes@ps.ge.com   Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?  thanks kh 
 Jose, Mr. Colin Wilkes from GE in Schenectady has agreed to speak on the topics below.  Thanks for your help.  We need to get together and have lunch to discuss the Sun Devil project on TW.  Talk with you soon.  Kevin Hyatt 
 Hi Stacey-- Hope everything is going well for you guys and you are staying busy (considering our current economic slide).  Have you seen Enron stock prices lately?  I've kicked myself everyday since January for not taking your job offer. 
 When: Thursday, November 01, 2001 11:30 AM-12:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Hey, I need to re-schedule.  I am a co-chair for the Enron Kids Committee and we have a meeting over lunch on this same day.  sorry- kh 
 Carrie-- Mike Nelson, Vice Pres of Pipeline Integrity for Enron, has agreed to speak at NGI Session A on Pipeline Infrastructure Security.  Mike can be contacted via the following:  Mr. Michel Nelson Enron Transportation Services PO Box 1188 Suite 3AC3101 Houston, TX  77251-1188  713-345-5241 michel.nelson@enron.com  Please send him a conf invite at your earliest convenience.  thanks kh 
  We got one wood duck out of the Moccasin hole.  We stayed till about 9:30.  We did see 5 or 6 big ducks pass way over the top of the hole, but nothing came close.  There was a lot of shooting to the east of us throughout the morning, but I wasn't sure if it was you or someone else.  kh 
 Sun Devil: Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having "marketing issues". ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement. Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost. Marketing - Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a "competitive" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5. AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable 	outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work. Sempra - No response yet. Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to 	utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system. Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.  Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review. El Paso / FERC  - waiting on response from Regulatory to review recently submitted comments.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002. Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Open season for the proposed West Phoenix storage facility began 10/15 and was to close 10/24 but was extended an additional week for market participants. 
   Attached are the notes for your meeting in Albuquerque.  Please avoid discussing the cost figures (it tends to reach competitive ears).  If anyone has any questions, or any competitive intelligence on the Sonoran project, please have them call me.  thanks kh 
 yes please. thanks 
 Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.  As for item 6, I may have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.  thanks again, kh 
 Mike- I will need to rechedule as I will be out of town that day.  What about sometime either 11/15 or 16?  thanks Kevin Hyatt 
 that will work, I'll put it down. kh 
 that's pretty cool stuff.  When I get some money again, I'd like to build a nice layout up in our library or maybe a bigger one in the garage. 
 Kevin-- As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."  Here are some of the details as we know them: All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%) $2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge) Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale 50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market  What we want to know is: How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs) How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?  What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?  Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6. thanks for the help.  Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559 
   thanks for the update on the Cougar.  I need to try and see him this weekend. 
 I am trying to get a customer to join us for Friday, he'll be in town Thursday and may stay over.  Let me know if you want robo-duck for tues.  kh 
 Estimated annual storage costs are $15mm if my math is correct. 
 thanks Buzz, this helps alot. kh 
 Sun Devil: Sonoran Pipeline -  Market intelligence indicated KMI personnel are canvassing the Phoenix market to solicit interest in a new lateral off the proposed Sonoran project.  El Paso Natural Gas is also supposedly contacting their CD customers to verify interest in expanding the Maricopa lateral. Marketing - Panda Energy - Meeting scheduled for 11/6 in Dallas to pitch various rate structures. AZ Public Service -  Will schedule next meeting based on Panda response to proposals.  Preparing detailed supply basin study and Phoenix supply / demand balance for management review. El Paso / FERC  - Reviewing comments recently submitted.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002. Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Submitted non-binding bid for 100% of Copper Eagle storage capacity for 10 year term ($15mm/year). 
 Lorna, were you able to get a copy? kh 
 Couldn't another explanation be that the Board DID UNDERSTAND the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the Chinese Walls and protections were put in place?  I don't believe the Board members would shirk their responsibilities (as you pointed out, most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions) if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals. 
 I am out of the office travelling 11/12, returning 11/13.  Let me know if you have an alternate time/day and what topic you would like to meet about. 
 The "revised" bear looks better, a little softer, more cuddly.  I'd do the revised version. kh 
 message from Doug Pedigo 
 Ben and Ron-- Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions,  Project cost $911mm Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01 Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%. Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers  In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.  Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?  thanks kh x35559

 FYI, I will be out of the office on Monday11/12 but will plan on working the lobby the remainder of next week.  thanks kh 
 Ron, can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.  thanks kh 
 Carrie, FYI 
 What would be the pressure if we don't install stations 1.5 and Kingman?  My thinking is we might not have enough market at Cal Border to require those stations. 
 Hi Harvey--  As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.  One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.  I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!   Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559 kevin.hyatt@enron.com 
 Sun Devil: Sonoran Pipeline -  Received offer price from Kinder Morgan to purchase capacity on their project. Marketing - Panda Energy - Presented capacity offer to Panda on 11/6.

  James & David -- Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms:  San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d  Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%.  I will be out of town till Tues 11/13.  Can we get together that morning and review your analyses?  page me if you have questions at 888-582-7421  thanks kh 
 Hey congrats!! on the new job.  Need any more people? kh 
 Carrie, see Harvey's message below and send him the speaking invitation. thx,kh 
 I tried to call you last week but you were with a customer.  At this point I have sold my Maxima but with the current Enron environment and poor stock market, I'll continue waiting to purchase any new vehicle at this point.  It may be after the first of the year before I do anything. 
 I'll continue to stick this out for awhile, maybe ride this wave back up.  I'm working on a new pipeline project to serve Phoenix growth.  Maybe the new owners will take a greater interest in assets than the previous ones. kh 
 We will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year.  I think for this year we'll be fine. 
 I'm working on a replacement. kh 
 I saw Scott last year at a Rockets game.  Remember Steve Dickerson, he's working with us now on a consulting basis.

 website is Benelliusa.com  Recent pricing on two models is:  Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is $1145.  This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.  Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl is $845.  You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black syn stock) for same price.  Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.  Both come with 5 choke tubes.  Let me know if you have further questions. Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559 
 I'll look at other sizes / kids in her grade and call you back. kh 
 No meeting today but here's the update.  We had our meeting with AZ Public Service on Friday 11/16.  Here's the highlights:  30 year term is not a deal killer Rates & fuel are high but San Juan gas price helps They like the pressure guarantee They like being able to swing the volume within the day  APS has electric line ROW that may include underground ROW going south towards El Paso.  If so, we may be able to use this path to reach Panda and the El Paso system at a reduced cost.  APS will check it out and get back with me.  Next steps:  meetings are being set up with Duke, Sempra, and PG&E for the week after Thanksgiving.  El Paso / FERC full requirments debate: A straw man settlement proposal was floated at FERC by one of the FR shippers.  FERC still wants the parties to negotiate a settlement but so far there has been little progress. 
 due to Conf room conflict (Ken Lay needed our room!).  We'll do it on Tues at 3:30 in 15c1.  We'll update you on the Phoenix meetings last week plus the Desert Crossing project.  let me know if you have questions. kh 
 we will have the adoption table set up Tues thru Fri this week on the 2nd floor from 11:00 to 1 in Enron Center North.  Please stop by.  thanks

 you are SOOOOO GOOD!! 
 Spoke with Jim Adams at Panda this p.m.  His new guy Steve Curley is now on board working transportation for Panda.  Jim and Steve will likely call us Tues pm or Wed with a short list of questions on the project.  Jim is also waiting on feedback from TECO on our proposal.  kh 
 good analysis-- maybe you should consider a new career as an ESPN sports commentator.  Who knows, it might pay pretty good.  thanks kh 
 thanks 
 i am still interested but the level of interest will depend on cost. kh 
 Price would be $1150 + tax, he has one in stock.  Ship time is usually 3-5 days. 
 Russ-- Attached for your review is the confidential proposed Term Sheet for Transwestern's Sun Devil Project.  As we discussed, it includes a 20% swing capability for Duke within a 24 hour period plus delivery capability to Cal Border.  After you've had a chance to review, please call me and we can address any questions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you later this week.  Hope you are enjoying the snow!!!

 Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option. 
 is this form on-line?  If so, how do I get to it.  It doesn't appear under "forms" on HRweb. thanks Kevin Hyatt x35559 
 thanks Jean!!!

 The Sun Devil model is pretty big, over 2000kb, I'm not sure how well it will email but we can try it.  We may want to send a backup on a 100mb zip drive disk.  Do they have the ability to read the zip disk? 
 Where are you at and I'll bring you a packet with an explanation?

 Attached is the Sun Devil model using the $911mm Capex and project life of 30 years.  The model is somewhat complex and may require spending some time on the phone with James Centilli, the model's designer.  We will make ourselves available at your convenience.  Regards, Kevin Hyatt 
 I sent the model that matches up with the information we have already submitted to them. 
 I called my friend at HPD, he is out of town for a few days while his dad has surgery.  I also left another message for a friend I went to grad school with for him to recommend someone.  I'll call you later with a name or two.  Kevin

   I looked over the entire list.  It amazes me what some people got, including those in my group. 
 depending on how things shake out with sun devil this week, I'd like to tentatively plan on taking this Friday 2/15 off.  Let me know if there's a problem.  thanks kh 
 I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):  1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.  Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?  2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC  APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility). 
 If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?  How early?  regards, kevin 
 Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.  The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.  thanks kh 
 David, glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?  It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.  stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you. Kevin 
  It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?  I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.  Hope you and Daphne are doing well.  take care, Kevin Hyatt 
 EB 1336 
 it just goes to show you, GOD is a first a Husker fan, then a Notre Dame fan!!!!!!! 
 a recruiter friend of mine suggested you contact leadersonline.com if you haven't already.  kh 
 I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  How do I get them comfortable? Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when? Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?  Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.  khyatt 
   Paul, here's the open season on our Sun Devil project designed to meet the growing needs of the Phoenix electric generation market.  Please feel free to call me with any questions.  thanks, Kevin Hyatt Director, Pipeline Business Development 713-853-5559 
 OK!!!!! thanks 
  Kevin, please review the attached and add any details you feel are necessary.  I'd like to send this to Arizona Public Service on Tuesday 2/12.  thanks, khyatt 
 thanks, that looks great! 
 Dear Curt-- thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions. 
 Geneva, see the document below for the music system bid.  Call me and let's discuss.  kh 
 it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around. 
 contact Nova Guides in Minturn, Colo 970-827-4232  have fun!!!!!!!!!!
