t you won't be here.  I'm selling the Maxima to Cathy Corbin for her son.  Now if I can get the stock price up, I may actually be able to afford a truck.  Have you seen the new Dodge-- way cool!! 
 According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions. kh 
 Dear Dr. Lay--  Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the "crack" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.  Thanks for your continued hard work and support.  Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development ETS 
 Is that "instant bam" an offer or just a suggestion?  I hear a mattress comes standard with every new truck purchase. 
 click in "index history" below so see historical pricing 
 looks good kh 
 Sun Devil is going well.  We're working to get contracts closed for the shippers going to Phoenix.  I need to send you the draft precedent agreement so you can start going thru it and making any necessary modifications.  I'll get that to you shortly.  take care kh 
 News Release--  January 14, 2002  With the pending takeover of Enron's formerly prodigious trading operation by Swiss banking unit UBS, the companies will soon announce a name change from EOL to the new name of UBSOL. 
 good luck on your kickoff meeting 
 My calendar says our appt. is at 2pm.  I can do it at 8am if we need to, but would prefer 2pm.  Let me know please.

 Carrie Mr. Colin Wilkes from General Electric Power Systems has agreed to present for NGI Session C on 3/20.  He will cover two topics including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and "Pressure Reliability".  He is preparing his initial draft which should be available in the next two weeks.  Please forward to him a conference invitation at your earliest convenience.  Contact info is as follows:  Mr. Colin Wilkes General Electric Building 40, Room 517 1 River Road Schenectady, NY  12345 518-385-7538  colin.wilkes@ps.ge.com   Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?  thanks kh 
 Jose, Mr. Colin Wilkes from GE in Schenectady has agreed to speak on the topics below.  Thanks for your help.  We need to get together and have lunch to discuss the Sun Devil project on TW.  Talk with you soon.  Kevin Hyatt

  We got one wood duck out of the Moccasin hole.  We stayed till about 9:30.  We did see 5 or 6 big ducks pass way over the top of the hole, but nothing came close.  There was a lot of shooting to the east of us throughout the morning, but I wasn't sure if it was you or someone else.  kh 
 Sun Devil: Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having "marketing issues". ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement. Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost. Marketing - Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a "competitive" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5. AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable 	outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work. Sempra - No response yet. Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to 	utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system. Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.  Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review. El Paso / FERC  - waiting on response from Regulatory to review recently submitted comments.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002. Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Open season for the proposed West Phoenix storage facility began 10/15 and was to close 10/24 but was extended an additional week for market participants. 
   Attached are the notes for your meeting in Albuquerque.  Please avoid discussing the cost figures (it tends to reach competitive ears).  If anyone has any questions, or any competitive intelligence on the Sonoran project, please have them call me.  thanks kh 
 yes please. thanks 
 Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is ha
