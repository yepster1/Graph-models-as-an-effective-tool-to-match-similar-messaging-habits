 Due to conflict with Stan Horton's meeting this afternoon (2/5).  We will reconvene at the regular time on 2/12. 
 I invited Mark Brand to join us.  I am trying to arm twist him into staying with Enron and work with me on this pipe project.  Let's talk Fri a.m. on where we want to go.  kh 
 Attached is the Sun Devil model using the $911mm Capex and project life of 30 years.  The model is somewhat complex and may require spending some time on the phone with James Centilli, the model's designer.  We will make ourselves available at your convenience.  Regards, Kevin Hyatt 
 I sent the model that matches up with the information we have already submitted to them. 
 I called my friend at HPD, he is out of town for a few days while his dad has surgery.  I also left another message for a friend I went to grad school with for him to recommend someone.  I'll call you later with a name or two.  Kevin 
 Alan, here's the open season announcement I sent to Mark Cook.  The scope continues to move around as shippers request various things, but call me and we can discuss it if you have any questions.  Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559

   I looked over the entire list.  It amazes me what some people got, including those in my group. 
 depending on how things shake out with sun devil this week, I'd like to tentatively plan on taking this Friday 2/15 off.  Let me know if there's a problem.  thanks kh 
 I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):  1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.  Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?  2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC  APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility). 
 If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?  How early?  regards, kevin 
 Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.  The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.  thanks kh 
 David, glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?  It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.  stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you. Kevin 
  It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?  I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.  Hope you and Daphne are doing well.  take care, Kevin Hyatt 
 EB 1336 
 it just goes to show you, GOD is a first a Husker fan, then a Notre Dame fan!!!!!!! 
 a recruiter friend of mine suggested you contact leadersonline.com if you haven't already.  kh 
 I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  How do I get them comfortable? Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when? Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?  Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.  khyatt 
   Paul, here's the open season on our Sun Devil project designed to meet the growing needs of the Phoenix electric generation market.  Please feel free to call me with any questions.  thanks, Kevin Hyatt Director, Pipeline Business Development 713-853-5559 
 OK!!!!! thanks 
  Kevin, please review the attached and add any details you feel are necessary.  I'd like to send this to Arizona Public Service on Tuesday 2/12.  thanks, khyatt 
 thanks, that looks great! 
 Dear Curt-- thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions. 
 Geneva, see the document below for the music system bid.  Call me and let's discuss.  kh 
 it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around. 
 contact Nova Guides in Minturn, Colo 970-827-4232  have fun!!!!!!!!!!
