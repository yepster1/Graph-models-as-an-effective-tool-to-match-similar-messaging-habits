tion" faults.  I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto (by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf), which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine. This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.  I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.  As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.  Mark 
 Tom,  Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) for all seven sites through May 2002.  I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the ESTIMATED energy lost. Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run. However I hope to have that result to you next week.  Mark 
 Tom,  Maybe I mis-interpreted again, but here are the graphs for site total (the boxplots are still by turbine). This is for May. I will wait to see if this is more like what you need before continuing with the earlier months.  Mark 
 They are both: doomat!1 
 Jeff,  Mar - May 2002 have been recalculated and spreadsheets created. Mar & Apr wend down slightly due to the "extra" turbines. May has gone up, possibly due to some data filling in holes from before, data recovery does appear to be better this time. The spreadsheets are sorted and totaled by Bus.ID. The "extras" are at
