 the Heart walk on November 3rd.  I'm working on collecting those pledges.  I hoping that it is kosher to hit up family members for pledges.  Mary 
 I don't know if Carl is going to walk in American Heart Walk becuase of his knee problems, heaven forbid that walking would injure his knee so he couldn't play tennis.  You could probably talk him into walking, because he won't do it for me after seven years of marriage I have lost my influence/I'm officially taken for granted.  I will be walking this Saturday so lets meet at my house and drive over together. 
 I just checked the SAP reports on Harrier I LLC, Grizzly I LLC, Pronghorn I LLC, Roadrunner I LLC that the total losses of $710,594,336 have not been booked in SAP for September. 
 Per my conversation with Eloise Williams the proceeds of $138,475,829 were never recorded on 33R but were recorded on 33Q.  Since this is a sale of inventory I'm assuming that the gain will be ordinary and should be reduced by the tax basis in the credits of $104.8 million. 
 No, sorry about that. 
 GOOD JOB!!!!! 
 FYI 
 6:15 works for me.  The best way to get to my house from your house is go down Shepherd past 59 and make a right on Sunset Blvd and keep on going past Kirby and Buffalo Speedway and a couple of stop signs.  My house is on the right.  It has a witch out in the front.  The address is 3726 Sunset Blvd.  Are you still on for tomorrow? 
 Started reviewing cummulative build files.  Reviewed companies for 3rd quarter close. 
 How about I swing by and get you at 11, Patty Lee, Rhonda Ryan, and Vickie Gross will be coming with us.  Mary 
 Dana,  I was suppose to do this a week ago.  Daisy is a friend of mine and she couldn't beleive that out of all the people at Enron I knew who you were.  She wanted me to ask you for your address so that she and Kim (who used to work for you but I can't remember her last name) could invite your wife to Accessory Cafe party that they are having at Kim's house.  Daisy said that they tried to send an invitation to Accessory Cafe party that was held at Daisy's house but the invitation was returned.  They had some nice things so I recommend it.  If you want to call Daisy directly her number is:  713-975-0250.  Its a small world.  Mary F. 
 RK,  I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  I know how hard it is to lose a parent.  Please remember that you are in my thoughts.  Mary 
 I would like to make an appointment to get the flu shot.  Thanks, Mary Fischer #35449 
 Nicole,  After thinking about our conversation this morning I don't think that we are on the same page.  I am looking for a sale of S02 credits that were sold by 33R but were held in inventory on 33Q.

My next question is what is the cost of  the inventory that went to cost of s
