or me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.  Love  Mark Whitt 
 I did but I didn't activate it.  So I thought it wasn't any good anymore and threw it away. 
 I have forwarded this to our credit department. 
 Please also fax this letter to our credit war room in Houston.  The # is 303-646-3227. 
 Sorry you are correct. 713 is correct.  It has been a long week.  Thanks Mark 
 That was friday night. 
  Did he ever have any taste? 
 The graduate has to buy drinks for all of her unemployed friends!

 Ireached Barry yeaterday at 011-529-848-7400  Rm.1607.  Are you sure your info is correct? 
 Please fax this to the fax number I provided last week. 
 Let's get a new product. 
 I think they will struggle to get the 175 MM/d.  Have you heard anybody else contemplating taking space on Western Frontier? 
 Look at the weekly strategy product for producers.  Let's see what one of these will look like for our customers. 
 That sounds good. 
 We are probably more interested in people who have more experience in the Western U.S.  Preferably direct producer relationships and Rocky Mountain Utilities and Industrials.  We don't do any trading in the Denver office.  Thanks for the lead though. 
 Is this your final version?  If not, we need the final so we can get fundies to set up the updates. 
 Thanks for coming to Denver for the meeting.  I know it seems like a longshot but if it happens I think we have an excellent shot at being involved in some respect.  Thanks again.  Mark 
 That sports email was great! ! 
 Are you saying that the U.S. Producers are hedging their Canadian Production with U.S. counterparties as opposed to Canadian counterparties?  Or are the decisions being made in the U.S. and executed in Canada? 
 Just wanted to let you know how Brian was responding. 
 We decide to leave out the $ value in order to focus them on the structure.  I do not see the conversation about option values on the pipe? 
 Enron North America does transactions with the following companies which may be considered Enron Affiliates:  Crestone Energy Ventures Bear Paw Energy Lost Creek Gas Gathering  All three companies are primarily gas gathering companies. 
 I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's "extrinsic value".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets . 
 Brian is showing up at our office at 5:00. We will be there soon after. 
 You know that ENA sold our pipeline assets to Northern Border Partners in Q3 of 2001.  That is what became Crestone.  The list I gave you is of who we do business with now. 
 We usually see mostly regional basis deals out of our office.  Especially with the bigger guys.  We do some Nymex trades for our smaller producers.  It seems the big guys use their banks for most of their  basis.  Thanks for the info. 
 That is the most fucked up situation I have ever seen in college sports. 
 You gotta see yhis!  Pass it on to other WGR alumni. 
 Make sure you read all the way through to Enron. 
 FYI guys 
 Please review the attached 
 It's pretty scary!  Shows the state of the industry, doesn't it? 
 We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft. Lupton facility.  They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.  The effective date would be July 2002.  The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.  Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.  Let me know your availability.  Thanks Mark 
 That gave us a good chuckle this morning. 
  These are the new days for the management conference. 
 I made one change. 
 Let's talk about logisitcs and your ability to manage your kids schedules with being gone from 7:00 to 6:00 everyday. 
 I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you see any other changes that are necessary.  Brian, let's get together this afternoon and
