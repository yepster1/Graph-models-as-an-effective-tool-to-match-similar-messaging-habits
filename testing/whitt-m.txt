t recently give this the smell test. 
  Let's discuss 
 I am ready when you are. 
 I can't believe they are going to stop the employees from managing their investments through such a turbulent time.  This will be a case study in how not to do things. 
 Barry it looks reasonable to me.  I sure would like to add something sizable to the totals for Q4.  But I'm a pig that way! 
 Not Bad 
 Can you see what this is and how we approve it?  Thanks 
 I don't have a problem with it.  I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the "kids" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.  At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.  Especially if Steve wants to "pick his brains". 
  The meeting will be around 1:00.  Just come to our office at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750.  Then we will go over to Crestone office. I anticipate that the meeting will last about an hour to an hour and half.  Mark 
 I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality.  Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.  If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.  Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments. 
 I am never big on utility guys.  This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas compared to U.S. supplies.  I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility. 
 Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

 Either time is good.  How long do you need. 
 Really well.  We are probably going to have another meeting on the 30th of October.  Jake Thomas and Steve Walton are going to attend. 
 I forwarded them our comments and characterized them as being supportive.
