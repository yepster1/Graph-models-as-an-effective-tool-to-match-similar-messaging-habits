 thanks Ina 
 Grigs, Ina said it would be on the 5th floor of the new building. Which is right? 
 ok 
 Thanks 
 Monaco, Whats up with you? Great SuperBowl. I hate the Rams, so glad they lost. I'm going down to Houston to work for UBS on the gas trading desk. New commodity for me, should be fun. Looking to get back to NY at some point in the future. I know you'll still be there, stinking up the joint. Anyway, will let you know how things go. Talk to you soon.  Badeer 
 Paul, =09I hope this is the right address. I ran into Kristian and Monica the oth= er day, got Kristian's card, and promptly lost it. I am going solely on my = formidable memory of the address. Sounds like you guys had a bigger freak s= how there than we did here. What an incredible story. Hopefully neither of = us will have to go through that again. I'm out of the office here and headi= ng down to Houston to trade gas. It's west basis, so I should be able to dr= aw on my power knowledge a little bit. Things got a little crazy here, will= have to tell you more over several beers, I think that is the minimum it w= ill take. Erica is excited for a change, although Houston is not her first = choice, she's a trooper and will find fun things to do. How is Sarah doing?= I hope she and the baby have made it through all the changes. There is a w= oman here who I think would be interested in coming to London. She is young= (only 23) but has raw talent. She started here last summer working in the = California book. Let me know if you could use a hand, as I said, she has ra= w talent and drive. Thats all from here. Stay in touch and say hello to Sar= ah.=20  Bob  ps my home email: rbadeer@msn.com
