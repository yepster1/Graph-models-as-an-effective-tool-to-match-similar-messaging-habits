 Amy,  You mentioned that it sometimes takes a while for the shiftwork differential to be credited.  Please note that I need to have it credited.  And, can I expect my signing bonus to appear on my May 1st paycheck?  Thank you for your help,  Eric 
 I'd like to attend the class on April 27th & 28th
