 Scott and Daivd, I sent this to Chance as well. Look at it and let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Joe 
 Ed, I spoke with Linda this morning. If we are intending to buy them gas for April, we need to know ASAP because nomination deadline for most of the Texas Inta-state   pipelines ( ie:Lonestar) is tomorrow by 2pm. 
 Made some minor changes 
 Chance, take a look at this file it will give you an ideal of what formate we are looking for on a consolidated report. We need the info non-PVed. Also, the oxy Info needs to be seperated. Info we need is:  Wholesale Financial Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index  Wholesale Physical Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index  EES Financial Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index  EES Physical Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index 
 Spoke with Chance on friday, he believes that the wholesale data is clean. I also sent an email to Chance, Pat and Scott that raised the issue of PV'ed positions. I am waiting for a response.  I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts. I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas. Any questions give me a shout. Joe 
 working on it 
 I will try to pay Duke Field Services  $293543, ASAP 
 Louis has brought up a good point. Are we able to see positions non-PV? also can we get a seperate nymex equivalent basis position 
 HEADS UP. 
 both list are on here, the one you are looking for is 3b 
 Shemin, you still stand by what you said below? 
 well, well 
 I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?  Joe 
 Louis, I, for now, have requested wholesale basis positions(price equivalent) be keep out of the price report. Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained
