 Twenty percent of the golfers always drop out at the last minute and you end up with more threesomes than foursomes. You should reconstitute the teams. There are three benefits: play is faster,teams are more balanced,and you get to know more people.    Sara Davidson/ENRON@enronXgate 04/25/2001 03:28 PM

 Howard-- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation. When we originally hired Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 minutes--5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience.. Some in the group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews & Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at FERC. I clearly think we made the right call in this regard. However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job. If that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview like the rest. The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get the job. That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the group. Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are absolutely sure they are the best there is. I have talked to the attys for both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position. I think we need to talk about this at length.    "Howard J. Weg" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 04/26/2001 09:47 PM

 I noticed from the attached report that the ExxonMobile case is set for tri= al=20 on June 25th. Since I have not heard from Jim Armogida or you about the cas= e,=20 I have assumed that you have it covered and that Corp has determined that t= he=20 potential liability lies at the Corp level. If this assumption is wrong,=20 please let me know asap. 
 Thanks. Frankly, at this point, it is anyone's guess how this will develop. Given your distance to Spokane, Is there a local counsel that you would recommend---one with good ties to Jugde Whaley.    Parker Folse <pfolse@SusmanGodfrey.com> 04/27/2001 04:02 PM 
 This looks good to me.    Vicki Sharp@EES 04/26/2001 10:39 AM

 Should we set up a meeting next week w/ the coal guys and Indiana counsel? Do you want me to come? 
 I will not be attending.    Andrew Edison@ENRON 05/11/2001 09:21 AM 
 It looks like I will be joining you and Charna in LA on June 6th. I heard from Steve, you or Charna( I think) that the meeting was scheduled for one-half day. That may be enough time, but if you are coming all the way from Cleveland, we should make good use of this time. I think we should schedule an entire day. Let me know your schedule.   I have forwarded Larry Oscar's letter regarding Durrel Metal Products/Sterling foundrey to Mike Smith and Bob Williams(713-646-6412) at EES.Bob is my counterpart at EES  Let me know if they fail to respond.

 I would like to attend if possible. If not--good luck.    Gail Brownfeld/ENRON@enronXgate 05/11/2001 10:14 AM

 These folks should also be on the Sen. Dunn call

 Just a late note to say thanks for taking a few minutes to meet w/  my friend  Richard Gruber a couple of weeks ago---he described it as a productive meeting. 
 Is it too late to help you on your antitrust question? I am around all week. 
 Just a quick note to say thanks for hooking up with my brother Steve. He is a pretty talented guy and I hope he can help you out. 
 Attached is an updated EWS Litigation Status Report. 
 Can you forward me some information regarding the French firm we discussed last week? 
 I asked my asst to set up a meeting w/ you( it has been set up for the 22nd). I am trying to get a better handle on the Neg CTC's--how they are earned/accrue. She should have set it up for your office. I will come to you. 
 Can you give me a quick update that I can send to John Nowlan re Vinmar and the other case( I cannot remember the name of the case) 
 After your arbitration is over, can you give me a quick (and short) update on Pacific Virgo that I can forward to John Nowlan. 
 Two Questions for you Mike:     1) What relationship does Sen. Dunn have W/ Aguirre or Milberg Weiss---has hein the recent past, or is he now joint venturing cases with them?  2) Does the Lt. Gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to the materials given to Sen. Dunn. 
 Robin:  I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

 I admit that this is a little unclear--sorry. Obviously, I am heading up the overall CA litigation strategy for Enron. Robin Gibbs in Houston is our lead trial counsel in all the CA cases. He is out of Houston. Mike Kirby was hired as local counsel in the San Diego cases, but both Robin and I have been impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit. I have asked him to lead the Sen Dunn response but he is coordinating closely with me and Robin. Is this as clear as mud?    Sandra McCubbin@ENRON 05/15/2001 08:21 PM 
 What position should I take? 
 Do you know anything about this?
