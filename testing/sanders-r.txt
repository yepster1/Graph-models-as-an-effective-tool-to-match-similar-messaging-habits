dge sustained(he has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help. 
 May I please have a flat screen? 
 I have called TVA's in house counsel to determine how the press learned about 
 It is really not the record retention policy that drives this decision, it is the open subpoena from the CPUC and the fact that we have been sued. Gary Fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature.    Tim Belden 03/02/2001 09:38 AM 
 Can you send them the info please

 Unfortunately, I will not be coming after all (it looks like we have it covered w/Jim,Robin Gibbs, and Mary Nell) However, I would like to sit down with you at some point and discuss Europe's litigation management strategy. Hope all is well.    Mark Evans 03/02/2001 11:54 AM 
 Please send this to Mark Manela by e-mail. Mark--- thanks for the gift but as I indicated in my voicemail to you last week, Enron's policy forbids me to accept this gift. Thanks again. 
 I dont understand your message.Squires is the Judge. Susan Myres is the opposing counsel    "Radack, Judge Sherry (DCA)" <Radack@DCA.CO.HARRIS.TX.US> 05/22/2000 07:39 AM 
 We have been sued in Cleveland. Do you know any good commercial litigators? Boutiques are fine. 
 Robin or Jeff----Please call me after this conf. call and let me kow whether there are any developmments. 
 please let Ann K./ Barbara G. know about this case 
 richard.b.sanders@enron.com 
 Ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000. If only he knew how hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron. Although I did not talk to him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any offer. Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press on. 
 If we are ever going to pursue this lawsuit, we should do it soon. Where do the traders stand on pricing/ MTM exposure? 
 Attached is the letter that legal believes should be sent to Venoco.  Please let me kow if you hav eny changes, otherwise please send this letter to Venoco by Friday.  As we have discussed, you may want to call Venoco to let them know this letter is coming. 
 Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky. 
 That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is it going?    Gail Brownfeld/ENRON@enronXgate 03/07/2001 03:06 PM

 fyi 
 What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your and Gary's thoughts.    "Harry Olivar" <hao@quinnemanuel.com> 02/16/2001 08:38 PM 
 There is a conference call on Monday that I have asked the Quinn Emanuel folks to participate in.If anyone else wants to participate, contact Bill Urquhart. I am out on Spring Break but can be reached at 713-410-6128 or 817-922-0998    Steve C Hall 03/08/2001 08:11 PM 
 I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville. I have just left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the document. Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of course you can always call Kevin. I am on spring Break but am checking messages. My cell no. is 713-410-6128.    showard@agsk.com 03/07/2001 06:47 PM

 I took an online course last month and would like to take another. I have forgotten my password/id and I can't login. Can you send me an enail with this info. Also-- I have lost the course # for the seminar I took last month entitled " Ethics For Inhouse Lawyers" which was a 3 hour course. Could you send me this? Thank You 
 I need you to take the lead in devising a strategy for how EPMI should respond to these requests. I will send you another on that Lisa Urick at the PX sent to me.    Tim Belden 03/09/2001 10:01 AM 
 In devising a strategy, it would be helpful to know what requests are out there. Can you get someone to put together the best list we can?    Steve C Hall 03/09/2001 07:51 PM 
 I need to get the form to show compliance, but I cannot get it online--I cannot remember all my passwords. Can you get this form for me? Thx.

 I know you have worked hard on this so I hate to start with a complaint........but this announcement is not the greatest. First, there is no link on the e-mail to make the trip to the site easy. Secondly, I tried the website address on several occasions with no luck. I am now giving up.

 I notice that Chris Healy and his partner are going to argue the motion to stay. Are we ok with this? Also--could one of you call me after the conf. call and let me know if anything important is discussed. 
 Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to coordinate that much, at least yet. Key Corp refused to wave conflict for several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of it. Do you think that if I went to Cleveland and talked to Schultes, perhaps with a business person, that we could get out?    showard@agsk.com 03/19/2001 05:43 PM

 We have no plans for the weekend of the 20th. Why not bring them all. We can get babysitters to help if we go out(which I am sure we will) As for the Perd, we are definitely coming. I invited John and Yvonne but they cannot come. Doug and Susan may be coming. Someone needs to call Steve and Jane Ellen---would you do this. We will come Fri. morning. p.s.--- I have read your explanation of when you are coming and what this Easter egg hunt is all about two times and I cannot make heads or tails of it.

 Have you met Mark Powell from Canada?  You should make a serious effort to get to know him since you are Mr Canada. He is here for 3-4 weeks more learning about the Home Office.

 Milberg Weiss is the main plaintiffs' counsel. They are a well known (and good) securities class action plaintiffs firm. The John O'Quinn of LA---Tom Girardi-- is the plaintiffs' atty in the somewhat related gas cases. These are not PI types per se, but more commercial litigation plaintiffs firms.

 That was our original plan---at this point I have no way of knowing---but I would guess that we would be arriving Fri morning. My life is not my own right now because of the crisis in California.

 I gave you what I thought were 4 copies of this pleading yesterday and sent what I thought was 1 copy to Bob Vote. As it turns out, there may have been separate garnishments against several Enron entities. Please get Bob to track this down. 
 I have called Jim    John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/10/2001 02:03 PM
