ve attached a copy of the draft response to John Pope's December 13th letter to Dick Ingersoll.  Please call me with your comments.  We need to send this letter by Friday. 
 After reviewing the petition, I think this belongs to EES. 
 I'm ok 
 The plans are up in the air. The first weekend that we are all free is the weekend of Feb 26.(if you can't make it that weekend, let me know.) If all three of us come, there is probably 4-6 hours of work. I would propose that we bring Ben,James and Ryan only. I will arrive Fri night and leave Sun morning. Let me know what you think. 
 I can't tell what changes he made. Can you? 
 Both Sheila Tweed and I have concluded that Kristopher Wahlers is not a good fit for our position. Do you have any other prospects? 
 Attached is a new draft of the letter to John Pope with all comments received.  Dick Ingersoll will send this out to TVA tomorrow.  If you have any other additions, please get them to me today. 
 Britt was going to check with all the Enron GC's. I assume he got no response. 
 Your observations on how to fix the problem are right on the money. The other thing we should have done is confirm that the broker confirm links the two transactions as well. 
 Have you received all the information you need? 
 Send it to everyone you believe should get it. Unless I hear otherwise from you, I will assume you are going to send the letter with attachments today 
 I have pushed this meeting until Feb. We need to meet w/:Mcconville(2 hours after Barth),Barth( first meeting in the morning), and Travis.Please set up asap. 
 Please try to track this down. 
 Bonnie White is handling Dodson case and will respond    Lisa Mellencamp 08/07/2000 09:27 AM 
 fyi 
 I am assuming this meeting is canceled. 
 Bill is a great guy but I have no interest in a presentation. 
 Sorry,but we have no interest. 
 ENA is prepared to file a lawsuit against Calpine Corp. relating to a trading dispute.   Please let me know by the end of today if you have any objections to the lawsuit or know of any potential counterclaims.

 What time is the party? 
 Whalley's asst tells me the meeting at the Px is at 9 am. I have left Greg a voicemail indicating that the three of us should talk today about strategy. 
 I have a schedule for Ms. Scott.  April 14, 2000  9:00-9:30 Lance Schuler 9:30-10:00 Sheila Tweed 10:00-10:45 Mark Haedicke 10:50-11:10 Richard Sanders 11:10-11:30 Lisa Mellencamp 11:30-12:00 Julia Murray  Please call me to confirm that this date is still available.  Thanks Twanda 713-853-9402 
 yes    Britt Davis@ENRON 08/07/2000 06:33 PM 
 Yes to arbitration. No to waiver of jury trials,unless the counterparty is in the Rio Grande Valley or some other bad venue. 
 I f you haven't already done so, please review the attachments. Don't provide any feedback in writing or e-mails,simply talk to them on an unrecorded line. 
 We need to meet with, in this order, Brian Barth,Travis McCoullough,Kevin McConville and John Hopley. Lisa Mellencamp may also want to attend the meetings with the attorneys from Millbank. 
 Does anyone know this guy and should we interview him? 
 fyi 
 Let me know what you think--obviously we need to decide quickly. 
 fyi 
 Please drop me a voicemail or an e -mail when you have the time. I am out of town starting today. Also-- I circulated the resumes of the two Canadian attys you sent to me last week.

 What is the last day for Deen to ask for a jury?    "Bill W. Ogden" <bogden@ogwb.com> 08/08/2000 10:43 AM Please respond to bogden 
 What is the status of my upgrade request that was made 5 weeks ago? 
 I have attached a redraft of the Settlement Agreement with Teldata.  Please let me know if you have any changes. 
 Thanks for yor message. On another front, I will be in London next week and I would like to meet with the attorneys who will be pursuing the Pacific Valour claim. Did we ever decide on counsel? 
 I dont care 
 I have asked Bruce Oakley for a status report. I'll let you know when I hear from Bruce. 
 I am in London this week and will be meeting with David Best on Thurs to discuss. Thanks for your inquiry. I'll let you know after the meeting. 
 Actually, my instructions from Nowlan are to pursue our claim against MTM. I am in London this week and I will try to meet with our London counsel to start the process. 
 By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn to pull the Tapes before they are deleted. Can you work with Linda and Ed to pinpoint the tapes we need to pull. Linda's direct no. is 713-853-6104. 
 Please send me a copy of the e-mail along with Kevin's response. 
 yes    Andrew Kelemen 08/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 Bruce Oakley has informed me that we will be filing a motion to compel arbitration, which should stay Sitler's ability to take any depositions. Either Bruce or I will let you know if it looks like the depositions will proceed.    Patrick Johnson  01/26/2000 11:27 AM 
 In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity. It is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction. I would suggest the following language:  The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable jurisdiction. 
 Is this case still active? If so,what is the status? 
 Please print out this memo with attachments and place it in the Calpine lawsuit file 
 As you know, several weeks ago we retained an attorney out of Wahington DC to assist us with the EPA permitting issues. The need for counsel was put on hold when we decided to move the plant. Is ther anything more we need to do to follow up on this matter? 
 Did we ever hear anything more from Mark Woolfolk? He was the attorney from Akin Gump in Houston who interviewed last month. All of the comments I recieved were very positive. The last I heard, you were talking to him about salary, but you were concerned that he was too far above our compensation level. Please let me know what I should do to follow up. 
 Attached is a letter re the above referenced. 
 Actually, when I say "retained " counsel, I mean we identified the best lawyer available and asked him to clear any conflicts. We don't need to do anything else. 
 Actually, I have a memo that will be finalized today. 
 I have attached final drafts of the Bonneville and Enestar response letters. Please review and revise the Bonneville letter and send it out. Let me know if you have any comments to the Enestar letter and I will send. 
 The check made it to us this time. My paralegal,Linda Guinn, is tracking down where it went. I am certain the $ was deposited. 
 Looks good. Please send. 
 Please send the Agency letter to Louise Kitchen and Mark Taylor asking for comments. Also-- change the reference to "earlier this week" to last week. Get the address from Mark before you send.   On the Hopley memo: 1. Add John Enerson to the list of recipients 2. Place the subsection titled "Suits against...." with the same offset 3. In the 5th line of the first paragraph w/o a heading change "that" to "than" 4. The first sentence of the Noram description is off center---specifically"its" 5. Take out the blank in the Noram description 6. Judge Kent not Judge Ken 7.Take out Midwest Gas Storage heading   Make these changes and send 
 I am in London this week. Can you take a look at this and let me know what it is and what we should do. Thanks 
 I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling rivalries going  I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating? 
 PLEASE SIGN MY NAME AND SEND 
 I  will be happy to do it this way. By the way, if you are sending a copy to Bill McCartney at V&E, you should know that I am also sending him a copy.    Stephanie Harris @ ENRON

 Thanks 
 Bob Williams has informed me that Christopher Carr represented the GOM against Enron. 
 fyi 
 Thanks again for the hospitality shown last week. I wanted to let you know that Fiona was especially helpful. 
 Cos 18 and 51 are the only ones I am familiar with and they cannot be dissolved. I am not familiar with the other cos, but I have asked Linda Guinn to confirm that there are no cases pending against them. 
 I just left you a voice-mail stating that I am available this morningor(even better) Monday morning. 
 Actually, I said I did not think we should pursue it, but that I wanted Harry to check w/ the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it go. We have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about. Any word Harry?    Britt Davis@ENRON 08/10/2000 09:21 AM 
 If you do not hear from Mike ASAP, track him down or leave me a message and I will. You have access to my schedule so you can coordinate with Ogden.(just let me know before you give the final say so) 
 If you want to speak with Harry, please coordinate through Linda Guinn 853-6104

 Attached is a draft letter to George Wurtz regarding the above-referenced. 
 I am clear Wed and Thurs afternoon 
 I will be on vacation. 
 .After some period of orientation and adjustment(6 months?) all attorneys: senior counsel, assistant general counsel, and vice-president are expected to be independant. We don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands. There is no "standard" promotion track. If a senior counsel is successful, a promotion to asst. gen. counsel  will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years. There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC. 
 The posting of this bond should eliminate the need to pay on the Enron Corp guarranty. Please refer all future correspondence regarding this matter to Bonnie White 
 In addition to the documents we have sent to Roland Tellis, we have identified the following documents to be located:  1. Credit's files - Contact: Jim Easter or Dave Gordi 2. RAC File - Contact:  Rick Carson 3. The final legal risk memo by Travis McCullough 4. Chris Hunt's files re Cogen facility (I have asked Twanda to set up a meeting next week with him which you should   attend.) 5. Donna Lowry's file 6. Jim Ajello/John Hopley's files 7. Paul Pizzalato's files (I cannot remember his involvement but Roland or Brian Barth will know.) 8. The addendum to the Deal Assessment sheet of 12/5/97 9. ECT's reconciliation for all fees generated by the closing 
 Who is handling this? 
 The Demurrer looks good. 
 please print out this e-mail w/ the attachment and file 
 Yes I get these postings independently 
 Please note that there will be no call today.  However, there will be one next Friday, August 18th at 10:30a.m. central time.  The dial in number is 1-800-998-2462.  Passcode 4309724 
 Easter is good for us. 
 Easter weekend is MUCH better for us. Just make it happen. 
 We left at 10:30 and went to Kenneally's Irish Pub to get something to eat( they ran out of food at the gala) I did bid on a piece of art, but I don't know if I won. I doubt it, it was a popular item. 
 Thanks for the update. 
 The use of Enron's name is OK as long as it is limited to that. 
 Attached is the weekly status report regarding ENA Litigation. 
 Attached for your review is a letter to Julio Cesar Rocha regarding Votorantim. 
 The lawsuit against Agency.com was filed this afternoon. 
 Do you know anything about this? 
 Can you have lunch on Monday? 
 I am very busy and very important but I will make an exception for you. 
 Ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them totaling over $8.5 million. These cases are, for the most part , suits to collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses. The likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small. 
 Where else? Treebeards---on Market Square You pick the time. 
 Thanks for your research. I hammered the old coot on the head w/it this morning. 
 Let me know what time and please invite any judge you like. 
 When you get a minute, call those attys who stated (swore) otherwise and find out where they got their information. 
 I will be there at noon 
 When you get a second, call me and let me know what is happening with this investigation. Also---are you going to Wyoming next week. 
 Roland-- I think that Brian is the correct person to sign these discovery requests. Having said that, I do not remember talking about that before you sent the e-mail to Brian. You need to go through me for that kind of decision. My only comment to the Interrogs is that Brian should use his old title in Int. #3 
 Paul-- plese call Lara Leibman at Enron asap. Her # is 713-853-1393 
 Did you ever send this letter? If so, please send me a copy. 
 Attached is a memo regarding the above-referenced.  Please review and provide me with any comments that you may have. 
 646-3393 
 I have not heard  from Barbara about Eitan, but my reaction is that he is not a great fit because of his lack of legal experience. Typically, we don't hire first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser(train) them. I know Barbara has been very pleased with Gerald Nemec, so her feelings might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced. However, I know that Mark H. and Jim Derrick will be very skeptical. 
 Linda-- see if Barrett Reasoner knows of a video conference  in Houston. 
 Could you give me a brief description of what this is? 
 In keeping with Mike Moran's instructions to be frugal, I did not book a video conference at Enron, but I have asked Linda Guinn to find one that we can attend in Houston. 
 The devil is in the details--- what does the power of atty say. Send it to me 713- 646-3393 
 Looks good. Let me know asap whether we get the requested extension.

 When do you think we will here something ( if today) ? 
 If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to the control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue that although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, Enron has no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of winning?  By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to comment on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.    Christi L Nicolay 08/10/2000 04:27 PM

 No on #1. Yes on #2. One thing we may want to add in light of #2 is a confidentiality agreement so that Jung Ho  doesn't find out about the settlement.    "Bill W. Ogden" <bogden@ogwb.com> 08/18/2000 02:12 PM Please respond to bogden

 I have not had any contact with the nuetral appraiser, so this speculation is from our outside counsel. Jean Frizzell inforns me that the nuetral is conservative and he doesn't believe that he will put any multiples on these investments. The numbers should be low.

 I have not followed this.  Should I ?    Dan Lyons 07/24/2000 09:16 AM 
 I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at NSM Management Co. acted improperly. I wouldn't close your file yet.    James P Studdert 08/18/2000 10:58 AM

Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel Levin 216-928-0600. They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk them out of it but they insisted. I instead suggested a telephone interview with limited depositions to follow. Please call me Tues about this. 
 I have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a messaging system that won't let me leave a message. That's ok today because I need to talk to you live, but it is good to know that I can't get ahold of you when I need to. I wonder if Bracewell's Wash. office has the same problem? 
 Joe--  How long can we hold off on this? I have left a message for Dan Watkiss to call me about helping us with an anti-trust analysis. Maybe you should also be on that call. 
 Call Linda Guinn at 713-853-6104. She has all this information.

 The policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in a folder. E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year. The policy has many benefits. First it clears up computer storage space. The policy can  also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where a Judge has required the wholesale production of  e-mails. Imagine if we were required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic. This has happened to a number of companies in litigation  the US( who have subsequently changed their retention policies). Frankly, the Microsoft antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy. In that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and others. It is unbelievable  what some people will put in an e-mail that they would never dream of putting in a "written"  document. As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved. Please check with your source. I am happy to discuss any questions you have about the policy. 
 Please schedule ameeting w/ me, Randy Maffett, Roland Tellis at Milbank and Steve Hamilton at Ecogas(if Randy says we need him) to discuss the Waste Management case 
 Thanks for the resume. We  interviewed Salley last year and passed on her.. 
 This email will confirm the meeting in Portland for October 3rd and 4th.  I would like to start the meeting at 11:00 a.m.  Please let me know immediately if this presents a problem with your schedule.  Christian Yoder, Mary Hain, Gary Fergus, and I will be meeting at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, October 3rd to discuss our response to the CPUC subpoena.  Please let me know if you would like to attend this meeting.  Finally, I have asked everyone to schedule a day and a half for this meeting.  Although we may be finished on Tuesday, I thought it was prudent to leave Wednesday open for further discussion.  Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-5587 if you have any questions.  The contact in Enron's Portland office is Jan King.  Jan's number is (504) 464-8814.  Thanks. Richard Sanders 
 Mike, Gary,and I are contacting the generators(Duke, Dynegy, Southern, Reliant, and Williams) today to discuss their approaches. Should we contact any retailers? 
 Please provide your comments asap

 Fine. I'll be gone Friday 
 Are we still on for Sun night?  I will let you decide where we are going.--somewhere near you is fine. 6- 6:30 is best. We will be with the kids.    "Radack, Judge Sherry (DCA)" <Radack@DCA.CO.HARRIS.TX.US> 09/29/2000 04:01 PM 
 Janet Moore speaks very highly of Denise. please let me know if you have any interest. 
 I had some problems with the atty at Vinson & Elkins who I sent your file to originally. I sent it to Josh McMorrow at Bracewell & Patterson. He will be up to speed on Monday-- he is doing his homework on the corporate entities today. His telephone # is 713-223-2900. 
 We are not in the market at this time. Do I need to follow up with Melinda?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sounds good    "Radack, Judge Sherry (DCA)" <Radack@DCA.CO.HARRIS.TX.US> 10/06/2000 02:25 PM 
 After you signed off, we set up another meeting---Fri the 13th at 11 am. Letr me know if you can't make it. 
 Where can I get a copy of Ken Swaisland's guarranty. I want to send a demand letter. 
 The sixth line in the first paragraph still refers to a "limited" production. Otherwise the letter looks good. I am still waiting on Management so don't send yet.    "Fergus, Gary S." <GFergus@brobeck.com> 10/06/2000 03:31 PM 
 ENA Management  has signed off on the letter. OK to send. Thanks for all your hard work.    "Fergus, Gary S." <GFergus@brobeck.com> 10/06/2000 01:02 PM

 Max-- I asked Bonnie White to assist me on this matter because I have been swallowed up on another project. Bonnie is with the Enron Litigation Unit and spends most of her time on ENA litigation issues. I know what is happening and I am still very much involved. If a lawsuit  is filed Ileana Blanco at Bracewell will be our trial atty. Her role is small at this stage.    Peggy Banczak 10/11/2000 12:10 PM

 I don't know the Merit case. As for Badack, ENA has filed suit and moved for Summary Judgment on liability.The hearing will take place in the next month. On Thursday  Oct 12th, I met with  Badack's outside attys re settlement. Badack offered $2.375 mm. ENA's last offer was $5.0mm. We agreed to exchange additional offers. Is this update enough?

 I have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday October 18 at 1:30 p.m. central time to discuss our strategy relating to the CPUC investigation.  The dial in number is 1-800-998-2462 (pincode 4699545)  The rough agenda is as follows:  1. Update on conversations with CPUC attorneys (Fergus and Day) 2. Update on status of other companies' responses to CPUC subpoena 3. Update on compilation of trading data to be provided to CPUC (Fergus, Yoder, Hain, Smith, Aamodt) 4. Legal analysis regarding Enron's objection to specific requests and to CPUC jurisdiction (Day, Fergus, Watkiss) 5. Assignment of tasks to be accomplished 
 It is a fairly complicated matter---Britt Davis is in the best position to explain the status. He will call you.    Justin Boyd 10/17/2000 08:50 AM

I have requested $500 for Martha Hill Jamison.  My sources tell me that the= =20 Republican activist groups (Steve Hotze) will be supporting Frank Gerald ov= er=20 Martha Hill Jamison.  Perhaps we should hedge our bets on this race.  Let m= e=20 know what you think.  There is another race that we have never talked about that I would like you= =20 to consider.  Michael Stafford is the First Assistant to Michael Fleming, t= he=20 County Attorney.  He is running for Johnny Holmes' office.  This may fall= =20 under Joe Allen=01,s umbrella, but I think  there is a tremendous benefit t= o=20 giving some money to Mike Stafford.  Steve Radack has informed me that he h= as=20 the "downtown establishment" support.  If he wins, great.  If he loses, we= =20 look good to Mike Fleming and to Mike Stafford.

 Thanks for your e-mail about the Duke/Enron case. There is only one slight problem---we have no idea what case this is. Neal Manne at Susman represented us in a case against Duke that settled early last year. We have no active litigation  or disputes against Duke. My curiosity is pegged out. I asked Bob Boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries. 
 FYI. Dow Jones had a story on our lawsuit. 
 I have attached a draft of the demand letter to be sent to Kingdom Energy Company.  As you will note, there are two blanks:  (1) the amount of out of pocket expenses we are claiming; and (2) the signature line.  Please call me to discuss this information. 
 I think we are in favor of the idea depending on what we buy. Frankly, the kids don't need anything there. What the house really needs are pots and pans. What is the suggestion?

 Please let Linda know what is happening. 
 I closed the Charles Schwab account that contained the Pedernales money becuase Schwab began charging a $15 per quater account fee. Does anyone have any suggestions about where to put it--other than in Doug Hester's college tuition. The account is up to(down to) $8500.

 The Joint Defense Agreement looks good,except for the application of Florida law. Have you looked at Fla. law?  With respect to limitations on possible claims, you have a good point.

 My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.

 Any thoughts on this question? 
 Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help. 
 I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business contact--a short and sweet letter should do.    Dale Rasmussen 01/04/2001 03:11 PM 
 Based on this information, I say don't go. Let me know if anything changes.

 One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million.

 He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that case. He never told me that he would be filing anything.

 On February 14, 2000, Enron North America (Enron) filed a declaratory judgment action against the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Chattanooga Division, requesting that the court determine whether TVA defaulted under its power purchase agreement with Enron by failing to pay undisputed invoices.  On March 6, TVA filed a counterclaim against Enron alleging that Enron wrongfully terminated the power purchase agreement.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 I would involve Michelle Cash or someone in Enron Corp who deals with labor/employment issues. I am surprised this issue has not come up before.    Peter Keohane 02/27/2001 06:06 PM 
 I told Sandy that this looked fine to me but I am not a trasactional lawyer. I just want to make sure you know the obvious: Intratex has the Beeson case attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise separate this company from Mother Enron. 
 I am scheduled to be in London next week.  I would like to sit down and talk to you about this.    T Paul Johnson@ENRON 02/20/2001 03:08 AM 
 As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help. 
 May I please have a flat screen? 
 I have called TVA's in house counsel to determine how the press learned about 
 It is really not the record retention policy that drives this decision, it is the open subpoena from the CPUC and the fact that we have been sued. Gary Fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature.    Tim Belden 03/02/2001 09:38 AM

 Please send this to Mark Manela by e-mail. Mark--- thanks for the gift but as I indicated in my voicemail to you last week, Enron's policy forbids me to accept this gift. Thanks again.

 Robin or Jeff----Please call me after this conf. call and let me kow whether there are any developmments. 
 please let Ann K./ Barbara G. know about this case 
 richard.b.sanders@enron.com 
 Ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000. If only he knew how hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron. Although I did not talk to him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any offer. Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press on. 
 If we are ever going to pursue this lawsuit, we should do it soon. Where do the traders stand on pricing/ MTM exposure? 
 Attached is the letter that legal believes should be sent to Venoco.  Please let me kow if you hav eny changes, otherwise please send this letter to Venoco by Friday.  As we have discussed, you may want to call Venoco to let them know this letter is coming. 
 Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky. 
 That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is it going?    Gail Brownfeld/ENRON@enronXgate 03/07/2001 03:06 PM

 What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your and Gary's thoughts.

 I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville. I have just left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the document. Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of course you can always call Kevin. I am on spring Break but am checking messages. My cell no. is 713-410-6128.    showard@agsk.com 03/07/2001 06:47 PM

 Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to coordinate that much, at least yet.
