regarding my personal financial situation.    I do appreciate your concern and interest; however, I have a very qualified financial advisor who handles ALL of my personal financial needs.  Please remove my name from your written correspondence/phone call contact list.  Sincerely, Stan Horton Enron 
 Great idea! 
 I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less) bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday.  You can send either via e-mail or fax.  Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him abreast of key activities in your respective areas.  I don't need anything elaborate.  Thanks, Stan 
 I will see you at 9 am on Sunday.  I am looking forward to playing again and to seeing you after almost a month. 
 Glad you could join us. 
 This is the entire conversation that I did not send previously. 
 I will call you tonight to catch up on the prom etc.  Orlando was ok. Nothing great.  By the way, DK, the twins and I will be in Florida June 30 - July 10.  When are you coming?  We will need to get plane reservations ASAP. 
 The information should have been sent to you by now.  I was out of town last week.  Sory about the delay.  Email is a great way to comminicate on this. Thank you. 
 Looks good to me. 
 I assume you have taken care of this and Jim is available immediately 
 I waited to get you one until they worked out all the kinks.  See how thoughtful I am. 
 That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also. 
 Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week. Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one of Lohitt's strong skills, 
 Please see below responses highlighted in blue. 
 A report would be fine.  You two are the experts. 
 Hello, Sherri!    I just wanted to let you know that Stan is out of the office today on a field trip, but I will discuss this with him on Monday.  Cindy 
 OK.. 
 I w3ill take them over to your Mom's or leave them with Debbie.  If they are not at your Mom's, they are at my house. 
 Contact Joe and suggest that he meet with you while you are there or I could do it for you.  Let me know. 
 The letter looks good.  It is factual and correct. 
 Congratulations.  It totally made may day also!!  I was coming back downtown from EOTT and went down Westheimer.  When I passed the old apartments I lived in for awhile all the bad days came thundering back and I just about lost it!  So you made my day!  Thank you!  Love, Daddy 
 I have the tickets.  Invite some friends if you want because I have four tickets and no babysitter.  Perhaps your Mother would like to go.  Have a good day.  Sorry I have been so busy this week.  Daddy 
 I will do whatever I can.  Joe is a real good person.  Besides I think you could become a very good regulatory analyst for us and Joe would be a wonderful teacher.  I hope everything works out for you  personally and professionally. 
 I agree.  There have been way too many surprises from this group lately. 
 Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from Enron Wind would be no.  You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the idea has any value to Enron. 
 Who is playing on Sunday besides me! 
 This is a friendly reminder of this weekend's Theatre Under The Stars Event, of which you and your spouse will be sitting with Stan and Debbie Horton.  This 2001 Gala will be honoring The Humphreys Foundation and takes place on Saturday, April 21, at the Wortham Theater Center  with cocktails beginning at 7:00PM in the Grand Foyer, seated dinner at 8:00PM in the Grand Foyer, and a special dancing performance by the Humphreys School of Musical Theatre at 9:30PM in the Cullen Theater.  This is a black tie event; valet parking will be available.  Have a great evening!  Cindy 
 Stan Horton will attend in person. 
 Hello, Joanne!    Congrats on your new responsibilities.   I don't know Bob Phillips and, therefore, probably won't be talking with you like I did when you were with Mr. Somerhalder.  I have enjoyed our chats on the phone and you were always very courteous and helpful.   Good luck, and maybe we'll talk again one day soon.  Thanks, Cindy 
 Thanks for the update.  Going to one of the power desks was a good move. Experience on the desk will prove very valuable in the years ahead.  I hope you made your Dad pay a premium for those peakers!  Stay in touch. 
 Thanks for the update.  I agree that getting the past amount will take some time. 
 The engagement letter was mailed last week.  If you do not get it by tomorrow please let me know.  Thank you. 
 The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting. The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for approval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would recommend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.  I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee meetings.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we can decide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation needs to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it himself. 
 If you need my signature you should get it by noon on Monday or it will have to wait until Thursday. 
 Good luck and thank you for a job well done. 
 I go to Washington DC tomorrow morning returning on Wednesday evening.  I will not be in the office either day.  Do you want tickets to Astros game on Friday night?  If so let me know.  They play St. Louis with Mark McGuire.  I know you will do great this week.  You are always prepared.  Good Luck. Daddy 
 I agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal flow improves dramatically.  For EOTT, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period..  We do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.  In fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices. Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices. Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.  That would include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well as fee based processing.  Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation). Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.  Does this get to your issues?  Thanks 
 Thanks for your reply, Dee! 
 Jerry:  Stan is in California at the KEYEX meeting today and tomorrow.    What do y= ou=20 suggest?  Cindy 
 FYI>  Responce requested.  Thanks 
 Please advise 
 Who is going to put our presentation together?  I will give it if you and Bob feel that is the right thing to do but I just do not have time to put the presentation together.  Stan 
 Would you ple
