ld be better for all parties. 
 Looks ok to me. 
 I am glad things are working out for you. 
 Six lousy weeks away from me and you go do something like this.  Now it will no more golf because you will have too many "honey do's" to do.  Just kidding.  That is great news.  Congratulations.  I can't wait to meet her.  When is the wedding date? 
 Apology accepted.  My feelings were hurt considering laning you the BMW, paying for dinner and washing and filling your car with gas!!  Love,  Dad 
 I do not think I will be able to do the conference call tomorrow.  Could you call me on Monday with further information on our panel? 
 Good morning.  I am at EOTT today and then I will go into to town for a little while.  Jessica is no9t doing very well and neither I am I.  Fell like I am coming down with something.  Talk with you later tonight.  Sorry I didn,t get to talk with you last night.  Both babies were real fussy and we had to work hard to get them down.  I did a pretty good job with Jason!  I look forward to you getting home for Turkey Day!  Dad 
 I recieved the same document.  If you would distribute it to the committee that would be appreciated.  I would think we might want to discuss it at the Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI.  What do you think?  I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board meeting.  Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from the Board to work this matter.  Bill we need to get the Board to continue to follow him if we are to make progress. 
 Good morning.  Thanks for the yahoo greeting.  It made my day.  Have a great day.  Remember that Cathy and Carol's birthday is Nov. 30th.  I sent them a card and a $100 check to go out to dinner on us.  I signed it from all of us.  Hope you don't mind.  They would enjoy an email from you.  Love' Dad 
 Thanks for the strawman.  I would like to discuss it at our GISB Board meeting on December 7th.  Any problems with doing that?  We have distributed to the Board Committee only.  My initial reaction is there is alot we agree on but there is much we do not agree on.  Let me know about the Board meeting.  Also, this Board meeting will be my last as Chairman.  I do not know what role, if any, Bill Boswell  (the incoming Chairman) would like me to play in the future in this effort.  Stan 
 Good morning, Melody!   Following is Stan Horton's information:  1.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2.  Enron Transportation Services Company (formerly known as Enron Gas Pipeline Group) 3.  1400 Smith Street Suite EB5020 Houston, Texas  77002 4.  713/853-6177 5.  713/345-7047  Cindy Stark Exec. Asst. to Stan Horton 
 Stan Horton appreciates the invitation; however, he is unable to attend.  Cindy Stark Exec. Asst. to Stan Horton 
 Ken:  It is my understanding that we must get approval from the Office of the Chairman to utilize the company aircraft for personal use.  My family is holding a Holiday Reunion in Atlanta December 18-23.  Debbie and I would like to fly to Atlanta and back on Friday, December 22, with our children.  The twins, Jason and Jessica, are a little bit too young yet to try the commercial airlines, which is why I am requesting to use a company aircraft.  Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all charges.  No problem if this doesn't work!  Stan 
 Stan would like to offer out the following Rockets' tickets (4 tickets per game) for preferably business first, then personal use:  Saturday, December 16, @ 7:30PM VS Denver Nuggets Thursday, December 21, @ 7:30PM VS Los Angeles Lakers Wednesday, December 27, @ 7:30PM VS Seattle Supersonics Saturday, January 6, @ 7:30PM VS Utah Jazz Tuesday, January 16, @ 7:00PM VS Toronto Raptors Wednesday, January 24, @ 7:30PM VS Philadelphia 76ers Friday, January 26, @ 7:30PM VS Vancouver Grizzlies  These tickets will be distributed on a first come, first served basis.  Cindy 
 Hello, Sharon!   Stan Horton is currently planning to attend this event.  Cindy 
 Agree.  Please handle at the Audit Committee meeting. 
 It should be the Chairman's choice but I would favor a Houston location. Also, please strongly consider having the Board meeting on Tuesday afternoon in lieu of the golf outing.  You might just get some Board members to attend at least one day of the annual meeting.  Stan 
 Hello, Dana!   The 1/24 tickets have already been spoken for, but you may certainly have the 12/21 tickets.   I'll mail them out to you soon.  Cindy 
 I am aiming for next wekend.  I need one more weekend to get the soreness out of my  knee which I messed up by playing too soon two weeks ago!  Thanks for asking. 
 Amanda:  Stan Horton is an Enron employee.   He is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Transportation Services Company and also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of EOTT Energy Partners, L.P.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks, Cindy Stark Exec. Assistant to Stan Horton 713/853-6197 
 Thanks for remembering their birthdays.  Drive carefully!!  See you sometime this weekend 
 I think we should try to keep alot of this out of oour emailfiles! 
 Based upon your representations I see no conflict and wish you well in your new job. 
 Please see attached.   Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns.  Stan 
 Hello, Rosie!   Stan has this on his calendar and will attend.  Have a great weekend, Cindy 
 Ditto.  Busy morning 
 It was the right answer for everybody.  Good luck and let me know if my group can be of any help!  Stan 
 Thank you for a very successful holiday party.  Debbie and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  Your hard work definitely paid-off for our entire organization.  I would like to host a lunch for the committee, after the holidays, as a way of thanking you.   I will have Cindy coordinate your schedules.  Thanks again, Stan 
 My condolences on the loss of your grandfather.  Please let us know if there is anything we can do.  Stan 
 You are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it.  You never get another chance at today!!  End of my phiposophical analysis of life for tday!  You are welcome to the car.  I will try to bring it tonight or better still can your Mom bring you over to get it tomorrow.  Either way is ok.  Daddy 
 Steve indicated to me that Koch has a 50% interest in the company. 
 Thanks.  Seems like everyone had a good time.  Happy Holidays!! 
 A's always please me.  You seem to have applied yourself this semester and I am pleased.  Congratulations. 
 Thanks for the note.  My policy is that I do not interfere in the hiring practices of my direct reports other to ensure that ETS is complying with all Enron policies and procedures.  I suggest that you contact Jerry Martin, Phil Lowry and Gary Smith.  Good luck on your search!  Stan 
 Will do.  Thanks! 
 FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit Committee.  SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald Smith wanted someone with an operations background.  Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.  Stan 
 I have asked Wilson Barbee t9o see if he can provide any assistance to you. I do hope you find something that meets your qualifications.  Thanks for keeping me updated.  Stan 
 I am at EOTT this morning.  Glad we early voted.  I think Bush has it and I don't think it will be that close.  Watch how Florida and Pennslylvania go. If they go Bush; its over.  If Gore wins these two states he has a chance if he takes Michigan.  Key states are Florida, Pennslylvania,and Michigan.  I am still hoping for a last minute Nader rally.  Sorry you don't feel well especially since this your your long day.  Good luck on your test.  I will be at the Rockets game tonight with tthe guys.  Email later this afternoon.  Love, Dad 
 Carol:  Thank you for the prompt.  The only times Stan has available for this conference call would be at 8:00AM tomorrow morning or 8:00AM Friday morning (central time).  Let us know what works.  Cindy 
 I can play on Sunday morning this week.  My eldest daughter has a Horse Show that I need to be at on Saturday.  Next week I could play either Saturday or Sunday.  Please let me know. 
 Looks ok 
 looks good 
 This looks ok to me. 
 I agree with Jim; it doesn't cost anything to listen. 
 I agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal flow improves dramatically.  For EOTT, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period..  We do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.  In fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices. Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices. Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.  That would include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well as fee based processing.  Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation). Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.  Does this get to your issues?  Thanks 
 Who is playing on Sunday besides me! 
 A report would be fine.  You two are the experts. 
 I will see you at 9 am on Sunday.  I am looking forward to playing again and to seeing you after almost a month. 
 I am sorry that you don't feel well.  Sounds like you have a cold or flu bug.  Please go to the Health Center and get some antibiotics.  If you feel bad later in the week, make reservations to fly home this weekend and put the bill on the credit card.  I will check with your mom tonight to see how you are.  Love,  Your Daddy 
 Thank you for sending these reports to me.  They are informative and timely. By the way, did you get Randy Horton's power of attorney form?  She has asked me to invest some of her excess cash and I executed the form and thought she had mailed it in.  Please let me know.  Thanks to you and David for the outstanding service.  Stan 
 Good luck to you.  Hopefully I can get out there this afternnon and see you ride.  I love you.  Daddy 
 This looks good!  Thank you. 
 I heard you are scheduled for another interview.  Good luck. 
 Just a note to say Good Morning.  See you this afternoon at EOTT. Stan 
 The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.  Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by the end of January. GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two proposals which have been advanced thus far. 
 Thanks 
 Please just call Cindy Stark to get on my calendar.  I would warn you that I cannot see expending money for such a book since I do not see any value that would be added.  It would be nice to have but I was turning down painting projects on our pipeline that were in the $10k range during oour budget cycle!  Stan 
 Glad you finally made it!  Good luck on your Legal exam today.  Get some rest and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.  The finish is close at hand.  Enjoyed taking you last night.  I like the time alone with you.  Saturday, I have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done by noon.  Let me know and send me your Mother's list!  Dad 
 NADER!  NADER!  NADER! 
 Thank you! 
 There is sure alot of scheduled activity where there is no revised completion date or a note that it is completed.  Can we get an update? 
 This is to advise you that we will NOT have ETS Monday morning staff meetings on December 18 or December 25.  Please make note that the next ETS Staff Meeting will be held on Tuesday, January 2, 2001 at 9:30AM in 49C2.   And then on January 8, we'll resume our regular schedule of having our staff meetings on Monday mornings at 9:15AM.  Regards and Happy Holidays, Cindy X36197 
 This is the final confirmation for our above referenced meeting which is scheduled for this coming Friday, December 15, at the Hotel Sofitel located at 425 North Sam Houston Parkway East (in the Toulouse Room....note room change) beginning at 8:00AM.  Thanks, Cindy 
 I am very pleased and wish you all the best in your new job.  Please keep me updated on how you are doing.  I guess this will make your Holidays a little better!  Stan 
 Well, folks, one should never use the word 'final' around here!    Friday's PRC meeting room location at the Hotel Sofitel has been changed to the Opera Room!  Cindy 
 Caron mentioned it to me but we did not have time to talk about it.  I will talk with her this weekend and see what she has to say.Hope everything is going well.

 Sunday morning works best for me.  It is supposed to rain on Saturday.  Stan 
 By the way I have the sweater you wore last Sunday that you left on the golf cart. 
 The press release looks fine
