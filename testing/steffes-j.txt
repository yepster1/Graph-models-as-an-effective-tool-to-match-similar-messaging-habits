 Call Ozzie Pagan.  Jim 
 Lamar --  I have received the list of the clients from John McMullen.  The key push is Legislative and AReM PR is not involved.  We need the customers to call the Gov and key Legislators.  Jim 
 Dave --  With EES' push into serving smaller customers, the issues in this situation -- potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information -- will become more important.  When EES focused on national outsourcing, this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions.  This issue, of course, is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share.  We are also watching for these activities in places like MI, VA, and OH.  Jim 
 We need to let Jeff Richter and Tim Belden understand the implications of this for current book of business.  Jim 
 Vicki --  Along with everything else, this bill continues to be discussed.  We don't think this is a high probability, but wanted you to be aware (and more importantly, this is California).  I'll keep you up to date.  Jim 
 Jason --  Dinner is at 5pm at the house.  We are catering from Eatzi's.  Casual dress is preferred.  See you then.  Jim 
 Janine --  If we have draft tariff language, I'd push pretty hard.  Jim 
 I will be setting up a conference call for later today to discuss our latest view on developments in the California market.  If anyone has any specific questions before then, please call me at 713-853-7673.  Jim 
 We need a model for the entire Midwest independent of the ability to change= .  Jim 
 2pm works for me.  Jim 
  FYI.  It would be helpful for you to be on this call.  Jim 
 The meeting to discuss California issues today has been set at:  12:00 noon - 1:00 p.m. EB 8C1  Dial-in #:  1-847-413-3181 Passcode:  7816787 
 Here is another file.

  FYI.  Please coordinate going forward with EPSA.  Jim 
  Here is the Proposed Decision.  Appreciate any thoughts you have on how to fight or when.  Jim 
 Bob --  Pls send Alan the overviews you and Ray put together earlier - thanks.  Jim 
 Bob --  Pls update me with all parties Ripple claims on this afternoon's call - Alan you should get on (4:30 Houston time).  Jim 
 I want to do this today.  Jim 
 Angie -  I will be traveling and unable to attend.  Hope everyone has a great time.  Jim 
 scary. 
 Sue --  What were the figures for the two months prior?  Jim 
 Should we include Becky Cantrell on these calls?  Jim 
 I don't understand why you were denied access.  Did we improperly file?  Call me. 
 Amr & Janel --  Please add these people to your lists.  Jim 
 Richard, etal  --  Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.  As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.  One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.  We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.  Any questions or issues please let me know.  Jim 
 I'll discuss tomorrow with Bob.  Jim 
 David --  I will cover for meeting and let you know if anything happens.  Jim 
 I plan on attending.  Jim Steffes 
 Sarah --  Two issues that we should work on -- First Energy discusses CBM (not sure of their position) and MAPSA deals with ICAP.  My recollection is that ICAP will not be addressed at this time?  Seems to me that we should  try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 1/1/03?  What do you think?  On CBM, now is the time for FERC to get rid of this discriminatory practice.  Jim 
 This is the list of the parties opposing the NERTO and their arguments.  Jim 
 My only addition would be to strengthen the answer to #5 - RTOs, even if fo= rmed, do not explicity resolve the question of the Native Load Exception.  = I think that this is critical to highlight if this issued is raised. =20 Jim 
 sounds good. 
 Harry --  I think that this makes alot of sense.  I like working through AReM on this= as much as possible. =20 =20 When is the next deadline? =20 Jim 
 Please arrange on my schedule.  Jim 
  John -  I think that Sue is still on vacation.  Jeff may be able to help.  Jim 
 Bob --  When should we file our complaint at the CPUC?  Jim 
 I wanted IR and PR to be aware that within the next few days  the PG&E Bankruptcy team will file with the Judge Enron's current claim.  We intend to ask the Judge to Lift the Stay so that we can file at the CPUC a complaint to recoup our current receivable.  I'm not sure what our public statements have been and as soon as we prepare the filing, I'll let you know.  If anyone has any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Jamie --  Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.  First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a "hot button" in DC and will change the proper focus.  In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.  Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.  Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working.  Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.  If you want to talk, please let me know.  Thanks,  Jim 
  Are we sending anyone?  Jim 
 Amr --  I'd like this as well.  Jim 
 With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.  I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.  While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.  For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.  This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.  Thanks - I appreciate your help,  Jim 
 I am not sure if we have a claim to "PX Credits".  Our claim is to the negative residual of Bundled less the PX Credit = Negative CTC.  Jim 
 Ray --  FYI.  Some information on how we are talking about the claims in the Bankrupcty case.  Jim 
  Include on the report.  Jim 
 It's on my calendar.  Unless I need to be in California, I'll go to DC.  Jim 
 Janel --  This paper has two great maps that highlight the Utilities' model for RTOs = and the FERC's current proposal.  Would be great to build this into some DC= and other political coverage.  Jim 
 Did our $MM Supreme Court attorneys have any heartburn?  Jim 
 Here is the file.  While there are some quotes, remember that the analytics were never taken to the final decimal.  We were mainly trying to make a political point.  Jim 
 Jean --  What is Doug going to say?  Do we have the right messages?  What about the retail issues in Texas?  Have we considered these?  Jim 
 Vicki & Evan --  Please see the e-mail trail below.  The PAPUC has assessed EES $147,000 for its costs.  We intend to protest.  Do you have any idea of who this bill would go to?  Jim 
 Tom --  There does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the CPUC.  You should speak with legal about the inquiry.  Clearly the CPUC has a right to ask anything they want - it is my understanding is that our customers have a confidentiality clause in their contract that prohibits them from responding.  Jim 
 Linda --  Can you please get a copy of the report below "Spending Wisely on Private Hubs" for me?  If it costs $$, I don't want it.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Jennifer -  Please make sure that Vicki gets regular updates of both bills.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Christi --  Fine work. Looks like we are moving forward in the SE.  A couple of discussion points.    I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).  Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.  For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.  This is important to highlight to the ALJ.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.  Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.  I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.  Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?  Anyway, great work in the mediation.  Keep pushing these guys from the South.  Thanks,  Jim 
  Jeff --  See below.  Does this fit into Mary's responsibilities?  Let me know.  Jim 
 Thought you should see this.  Jim 
 Should we talk about the implications for the PX Credit given this PD?  I am guessing that this would significantly alter the calculation for PG&E - moving DWR from $60 to $140.  Do we want to file comments on how this should than resolve the PX Credit process?  Jim 
 I wanted to re-confirm that you are covering?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Please set up a meeting on Monday with Becky.  Thanks 
 This guy runs a small think tank / TV and radio program that tries to push competitive ideas.  He is very pro telecom and energy dereg.  Not sure if this is something that makes alot of sense for Enron, but thought I'd get your spin.  I'll follow up with you.  Jim 
 Thanks for the material.  I am discussing internally.  Will keep confidential.  Jim 
 Good info.  I like the Reg Orig plays.  Amr should track our success.  Jim 
 Jim --  I'll be staying downtown.  Once I finalize my plans, I'll get in touch to finalize our meeting.  You're right about our thinking - probably just to get a feel for some ideas, nothing formal.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Lisa --  I don't have any funds for this.  Sorry.  Jim 
 Jose - thanks.  Also, feel free to send to JoAnn Hill in Houston.  Jim 
  For the report. 
 Susan --  Please put in an RCR to discuss ASAP (probably next week).  I think that the key issue involves the inclusion of financial transactions.  Need a solid message from industry that this is inappropriate - which EPSA members are filing this info?  Jim 
 Some thoughts from Bob Williams.  Jim 
 Please let the right person know that I will be on vacation.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Fully agree.  I figure Sarah's already committed to #2.  Jim 
 Charles --  After our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider --  1.	How does NERC define "security"? (important to differentiate between national security and system security). 2.	What is NERC's role in national security? 3.	Will RTOs degrade national security?  system security? 4.	What does Enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps? 5.	Does Enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?  This Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.  Thanks. 
 Guys --  We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).  Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.  Thanks 
 I'm on my way to DC.  Please ask my asst to set a good time to call with you on Wed.  Thanks 
 Unless Jean hears otherwise, I don't think that Enron needs to be doing anything that conflicts with the key policy arrangement on the marketer being the customer of record for the T&D services.  Jim 
 What does Mike Roan think??  Also, will they help pay for our "natural market study" in the SE??  Jim 
 Ray --  Wanted to make sure that you had seen the note Sanders sent around?  I think that we should discuss today on the 4:30 call.  Jim 
 Lisa --  Give me a call about this and Item #1 below.  Jim 
 Please print and ensure that Jose Bestard has this info.  Jim 
 Have we done my travel for NERC meeting in Vancouver?  Jim 
 Looks good.  Why doesn't EPSA propose a timeline for the FERC to order?  This could be a signal that we only want one "rule change" date.  Also, maybe we can build in Kevin's argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now.  Jim 
  The statements.  Jim 
 Rick --  You indicated that NERC disavowed their discussions with the press about national security and RTOs to NB (I may have misheard you).  I think these attachments would prove otherwise.  Finally, I'm sure that RJ Rudden is just fronting for Southern.  Jim 
 Paul --  Can we have a phone call with our Reg team on Friday to make sure that everything is a-ok?  I want one final run through.  If yes, please let me know by phone and I'll ask Linda Noske to set up the call.  Also, I owe you a call on Sue / Jeff.  Are you in Thurs?  Jim 
 Here is my proposed budget.  Jim 
 Mike Roan and Tom Hoatson would be the best.  Jim 
 Lynnette --  Please talk with Pat Keene about Nevada.  Some customers will have access.  Jim 
 Please make sure this discussion is incorporated into the Monthly Report 
 This is a non-ERCOT Texas utility.  Jim 
 Rick --  Belden is in Houston next Wednesday and a number of the Western team is going to visit with him about current status and issues.  Also, he wants to get more info on the PJM model.  Congress has re-scheduled the hearing on Reliability for the same time.  Can you attend the Belden meeting in Houston (Presto is coming for the PJM model discussion)?  Jim 
 Dave --  Do we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?  I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.  Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.  Jim 
  Rick --  Please see attached.  Lot's of $$ from CA.  Jim 
 Thanks Dave.  The critical things for us to take-away are the key priorities for the Desk moving forward.  On this, I want to make sure that Kevin and Tim are comfortable with the evolving process of implementing RTOs - Option 1: wait till completely ready or Option 2: start with basic and "improve".  Thanks,  Jim 
 Becky --  My only question is one of emphasis.  Are points 3&4 the key for Barry T.?  If so, should we move them up higher?  Also, why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points?  The length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate.  Maybe a list of bullet points up front?  Jim 
 Should we add a Project titled "Interconnection NOPR" for Susan Lindberg?  Jim 
 Susan --  Can we sit down tomorrow or Monday for 30 minutes to discuss.  Maybe at 11am Friday.  Want to get an idea of the timing and our position.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Please put on my calendar and arrange travel/hotel.  Thanks 
 Rick --  I see that Amr has taken over the Fundamentals Group.  The fiefdom grows!!!!  Jim 
 Ray --  I think that this is about the CalPX bankruptcy.  Any issues?  Can you please get with PGE to make sure we are on the same page?  Jim 
 Mary --  As we discussed, please find a list of our project team leads on on-going wholesale matters.  Thanks,  Jim 713-853-7673 
 Could you please find out what group Carlos works with and pass him some information?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Info you wanted.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info.  Not sure what we're doing.  I'll pass this along.  Jim 
 Please consider this candidate for the position.  Jim 
 Probably want to talk with Jay Lewis and other product leads?  I'll get some names.  Jim 
 Did you attend?  Did we file comments?  Jim 
 Thanks for the info.  We need to push for other good load programs in PJM a= nd New England.  Jim 
 Before I send this Louise, I'd like your thoughts.  The element that drives the EA # higher than I would have thought is the large number of people who are working on RTO and NERC only matters.  I've made a decision to assign these people to EA rather than spread to EES.  I could change if you think appropriate.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Lisa -  Please include G. Canovas in these discussions going forward.  Thanks. 
 Any other news?  Jim 
 Sure.  Jim 
 I think it's a fair statement that Enron doesn't currently support the Bart= on language.  On this issue, I would argue that any penalty imposed should = remain the purview of FERC and its procedures.  Jim 
 Mike --  Let's discuss.  I don't want to overextend our involvement to all regional reliability councils and all working groups. If the MAPP RTC is critical, let's understand why and staff as best we can.  Jim 
 Jim --  Do have a final copy for my files?  I assume that we submitted?  Jim 
 I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.  While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge= nerators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATIO= N ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper= states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE= S TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICIT= Y DEREGULATION."  In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -= - A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS= ."  I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat= on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental = market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financi= al and political crisis.  The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES = WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED= MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTR= UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF = THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."  Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (toge= ther with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly und= ercuts the "political" arguments of the Davis administration who had every = opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible l= ong-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consume= rs.  Jim=20 
 Today after the Hearing I attended lunch with John Anderson and Phil Harris.  One of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond to the NERC legislative efforts?  Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over reliability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.  Agreeing to that, the idea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to that language.  I think that internally Enron is already there???  John Shelk, if you could pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that would be very helpful.  I'll let you know how we next proceed.  If anyone has any problems, please let me know.  Thanks. 
  Lisa --  Who should I send this guy to?  Tim Battaglia?  Thanks. 
 Lisa --  I haven't forgotten about trying to find a name.  Was on vacation in early October.  I will ask around for the right name.  Hope Roger and you are doing well.  Grace is keeping Marianna and me very busy - she's now 19 months and pretty much runs the whole house.  Talk with you soon,  Jim 
 Sarah & Christi --  Let's make sure that we get our comments together prior to the phone call.  How about a phone call at 8:30 am CDT on Friday?  Also, probably don't need everyone on the EPSA call so maybe we should organize our participation?  Pls let me know.  Jim 
 Bryan --  a.	A good resource for you. b.	Also, if anything is intersting, may want to add.  Key would be MI, NV, and VA discussions.  Jim 
  Pls include on the report.  Jim 
 Do you want to do this?  Jim 
 Pls include on the Monthly Report 
 Pls incorporate as appropriate into our presentation.  Jim 
 I will be out of town. 
 Here are the other files.  Jim 
 Per our conversation today --  1.	Sue Mara is working with AReM to (a) work on an alternative vehicle for DA - the Bowen bill, (b) get the "taking" argument for retroactive CPUC action to Norm Plotkin and Richard Katz, (c) call APS Energy Services to motivate Boeing, (d) getting AReM active on the date issue.  By the way, Sue Mara heard that the CPUC has received "hundreds" of letters related to the CPUC decision.  2.	Everyone should be working to get customers focused on messaging to the (a) Governor's office and (b) trade associations.  KEY MESSAGES:	1.	Don't have the CPUC Make Wrong Decision Tomorrow 2.	SB78 can work if DA Suspension Date = Sept 1.01 or Later 3.	Setting this DA Suspension Date Does NOT Mean that Customers Will Escape Fair Surcharges  I am putting together a gameplan right now for who to call and the messages.  3.	I called Sandra Yamane (at Marathon Communications) re: CEO contacts.  Once I receive the list, we'll make a decision on how to proceed with that group.  4.	Hedy is working to get Hertzberg (and any others) to call the CPUC and seek another delay.  5.	Mike Day - can you please draft language to use on the Assembly floor to "fix" SB78 per our interests.  Hedy & Bev, who should support the amendment?  Don't we need a member to carry the provision?  Wouldn't it be better if we had CMTA or the CA Restaurant Association?  Is this possible?  6.	Scott Govenar is calling Boeing's lobbyist to get them "interested".  Thanks everybody.  Keep up the great work!!!  Jim
