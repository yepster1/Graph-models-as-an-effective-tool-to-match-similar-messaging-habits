eep engaged through Perrino.  I'll try and make the call this Thursday.  Jim 
 Donna --  I'd say that it is a commercial matter.  Try and push the bill back.  I know that Paul says his RC is closed but someone above him has to have some $$.  Jim 
 Jean --  Why not ask Marianne Carroll to draft a short note on the current status of the docket and likely outcomes/timing?  Thanks. 
 My number is 713-853-7673.  See you Tuesday. 
 Nancy --  1.	Are we able to vote? 2.	If yes to #1, what is your recommendation for our vote?  Thanks,  Jim 
 We need to discuss the economics of this on our book (assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers).  Jim 
 Denise --  Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs? Speaking with Gloria, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.  Rebecca Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.  The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).  I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to "Financial Guarantees" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.  Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Andy --  I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.  I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.  Thanks,  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Why does Edison care about DWR stranded costs?  Are these the costs of the bonds or the above market long-term contracts?  Jim 
 I assume we are happier with this message? 
 Rick --  Please find attached the asset report in Texas.  Enron's ownership depends on what day the filing is made (for instance, Indian Mesa won't be active until Dec and may be sold immediately).  Also, there is an on-going arbitration with Cornhusker about our ownership right.  Andy Edison has the lead from EWS legal.  Jim 
 Rick --  Here is the information on staffing and outside services.  Call if you need anything else.  Jim 
 ok 
 This means that the DST proceeding moves forward - right?  How about a phone call at 3pm HOUSTON TIME to catch up on all matters?  Jim 
 Lunch works.  I thin 11:45 is best.  Jim 
 Attached is the most recent statement from the California Utilities that implements the DA Suspension (filed Friday). Comments are due Nov 28 (Wed) from parties.  The Utilities continue push for a "hard" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.  Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.  Jeff and I will be talking with Mike Smith (and anyone else who wants to participate) to work through our response to these comments.  Jim 
 Not sure yet.  We will be talking with AReM and will want your input.  We may have to file but not sure.  Jim 
 Linda & Sarah --  I intend to come to DC tomorrow night and attend the EPMI v. FERC hearing (if I still have a seat).  I'm planning on attending the GENI meeting Wed pm and Thurs.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I know that was the plan and we do intend to work with AReM, but we may have to file if our needs aren't met.  Jim 
 Thanks for the invite but I'll think the DC team should brief Greg on the beltway politics and energy policy.  I'll join you guys at the Supreme Court invitation window.  Jim 
 Gloria --  Where are we on a matrix of Utility agreements?  Jim 
 How about heading off campus - less likely to run into Enron people.  Let's meet in the parking lot entrance (right where the little store is on the way to the Met) at 11:30.  If anything comes up, call me on my cell at 713-851-2499.  Jim 
 I would like to take something to Dan Leff by end of business tomorrow.  Whatever we have.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Jim --  How about breakfast on Wednesday this week?  I'm coming in tomorrow night and could do breakfast on Wed.  Jim 
 Draft. 
 After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.  If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.  Thanks. 
 EES does not sell power except potential if it overschedules to their retail load and "sells" balancing energy to IP.  I'm not even sure if we are delivering any energy to any customers in the market.  I'll send to Rogers Herndon.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Jean --  Is the PUC going to agree on AEP's motion (please see below)?  What are we = doing to stop this movement?  AEP is ready to go in Ohio with the same noti= ce but just haven't done anything in TX.  Jim 
 During the merger, transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners (IP / PGE) should not do business with the other.  If EES or EPMI is buying or selling from IP, please let me know.  Also, if we are delivering to retail load behind the IP market, we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct.  I don't think that we have to worry much with PGE side because EPMI and EES are already acting within the code of conduct.  Jim 
 Molly --  Please let either Gloria or Harry know if you need our assistance.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks for keeping Wes and Mary Lynne informed.  I give this chance a very low probability right now, but we'll see.  Jim 
 Can we change the project lead on the RTO NOPR on Standards of Conduct to be both Lisa Yoho and Leslie Lawner?  Also, can you call the project leads before the memo goes out to make sure that they are aware of their responsibilities - just a heads up?  In paragraph 2, your language is that this is addressed only to the people on the chart.  I think that Rick intends to send out to everyone in GA.  Maybe we want to change to indicate that people are welcome to be included in teams if they were not mentioned.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Jim --  Just trying to follow-up on the next meeting?  Any news? 
  Alan & Paul --  See John Shelk's e-mail below.  Alan, you may want to coordinate.  Jim 
  Harry & Nancy --  I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.  In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the "customer of record" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.  Let's talk.  Jim 
 Jo Ann --  Do you know if Dan Staines has an active Employment Contract?  JIm 
 haven't checked voice mail at home - in DC. have time to talk right now on phone?  Jim 
  Jeff --  How about a call tomorrow to discuss?  Jim 
 FYI.  The first memo. 
 Guys --  We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).  Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.  Thanks 
 Paul --  What happens if BPA doesn't join?  Jim 
 Pls come by at 11am.  Thx. 
 Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.  Jim 
 Dave --  Can you please send to Rick Shapiro the agenda for next Wednesday's meeting?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Steve --  I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --  1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint  We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  2.	California Legislation  SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.  Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.    3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona  Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.  4.	FERC Refund Case  Enron presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.    5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation  Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.  6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive  Sue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close). 
 HERE ARE THE FINAL SLIDES. 
 Wade --  Home 281-759-8270 Cell 713-851-2499 
 We should also make sure that Paul Kaufman and Pat Keene attend.  Thanks 
 Thanks for the info. I'll leave in your and Leslie's capable hands.  Jim 
 Sarah --  Should we try and lobby any of these witnesses prior to next week?  I was thinking about John Meyer and Peter Cramton specifically.  Jim 
 I'd have Susan Lindberg and Charles take on this.  Jim 
 John --  On this bill, I would think that as far as our competitive businesses go, we should work through EPSA.  Better to have the industry speaking with one voice.  To that end, do we know where EPSA is on this - Reliant and Mirant will have a much larger impact.  Finally, we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators.  Jim 
 I think that Kerry Stroup is handling non-MISO/ARTO midwest matters. 
 John --  I'm heading up tomorrow.  Do we need a call today to make sure that my ducks are still in a row?  I don't have the Barton draft handy.  Jim 
 Shirleen --  Can you please send me the most recent version?  Thanks. 
 Vicki --  FYI.  This bill continues to move.  Jennifer Thome prepared this synopsis.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I'll ask Jennifer to keep you updated on any changes and status.  Jim 
 Pls get with Susan to make sure coverage is appropriate.  Jim 
 Sounds good to me.  I'm out on Wednesday but in the rest of the week.  Jim 
 My comments --  I assume that in the Enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 12-15-02 date?  Also, critical to highlight that the FERC should have one "major" change date, not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change.  Finally, break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition. Every state inside this region (except VT) has competitive retail access.  Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business "easier" for companies like EES.  We should play this up.  We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down.  I didn't see that language on consumer benefits.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info.  Please stay closely linked with the RTO Week activities to try and read Wood's questions.  Also, John Meyer from Reliant is testifying.  What will be his position?  Should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way?  Wasn't he the head of Congestion Management in ERCOT originally?  I think this is Wood trying to ask him how ERCOT works.  What will he say?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Sarah --  Pls coordinate with Kerry Stroup.  He is the Mike Roan of the Upper Midwest.  Jim 
 FYI 
 Is this moving forward?  Jim 
 Sue and Jeff --  I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).  Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.  My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.  Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?  Thanks. 
 Janine --  I have not yet talked to Kerry about this but the Translink is moving forward.  Will you do it today?  Jim 
 FYI 
 Sounds like flying Sunday night.  Jim 
 Please do.  Jim 
 Howard --  If the ONE RTO doesn't have a day-ahead market, what happens?  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 If you need anything else, please let me know.  Jim 
 Talk with John Shelk in our DC office.  Jim 
 Ban --  Sorry to take so long to reply.  Family is fine post NYC attacks.  Not sure if we have any needs right now.  I'll keep you in mind as the Budget / Staffing moves forward.  Take care,  Jim 
  Looks fine.  Thanks for everything.  Jim 
 Thane --  Pls work with Christi and Sarah to find a time to call John.  Jim 
 Dasovich this is in your court.  Jim 
 I looked at it today on the plane.  I don't see any issues although we are in the middle of budget process and will see if this impacts this request.  Jim 
 Charles --  If the RTO has the Interchange function, what else is needed for "virtual" consolidation?  Jim 
 Need to also include the moneys owed to Enron and its affiliates related to the wholesale power transactions.  We should also seek to clarify the language about us supporting the PE Advice Letter proposal on going-forward.  Jim 
 The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response.  It's their $$.  So far, my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations (as outlined in the Mike Smith memo) are the "preferred" outcome - I'll reconfirm.  Jim 
 Rick --  This is the spreadsheet.  Jim 
 Louise --  Here is the analysis on how many Govt Affairs' FTEs work on Enron Americas matters.  The bottom line = 67 Professionals in group / 29 FTEs on Enron Americas.  Call if you want additional information.  Also, I am trying to arrange a meeting for this Friday to discuss our next Monthly Update (which I am finishing hopefully tomorrow).  Thanks,  Jim 
 perfect. 
 Pat --  I received your voice mail.  Will be testifying this morning.  I will try and call later today.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Fine.  I still think that any obligation is a mistake.  Just improving a bad market is not going to help.  Make sure that Dan Allegretti is in the loop.  NEPOOL is putting something like this together.  Jim 
 On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.  On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.  Jim 
 FYI. 
 Fair points.  My dogma machine is running at high today.  Don't disagree with your thoughts.  Let's get the answer that works for the business for the long-term.  Jim 
  Not too sure how important, but wanted everyone to see the discussion from Jamie Wimberley at CAEM.  Jim 
 Diann --  I agree with Bob.  Please let us know as soon as possible if SCE is willing to discuss this fairly.  Jeanne --  I guess that we would update our Complaint if need be?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Steve --  We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?  Jim 
 FYI.  Probably too early for you guys.  Jim 
 Not that I know?  Jim 
 David --  My thoughts.  I would change the section "Reliability" to "Operations".  The Current framework is Non-standardized;  Poor Seams Interface  Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that "Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner."  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.  Under Generation - I would change "optional" to Optimal.  I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.  Thanks,  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Ok.  Thanks.  I hope that Lora can send a copy.  Jim 
 Yes.  Peter is the one who I spoke with.  My testimony went fine.  Me too.  Jim 
 Steve --  Got a note from EES that there was a Energy Summit in MA to discuss next steps of restructuring today.  The meeting is today.  Are you going?  Did anyone go?  Thanks 
 Thanks for the info.  While there may be some differences in presentation, there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis.  All of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain.  I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes).  Let me know if there is anything else.  Jim 
 Jamie --  Thanks for the external view on legislation.  I agree that most of the bills don't "get it right" - the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance (which of course would be wrong).  Not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work - not enough $$ to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities.  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Thanks Janine.  Also, please keep Paul Kaufman and Jean Ryall in the loop. = We need to make sure that we do this nationally. =20  Thanks.  Jim 
  FYI 
 This is especially problematic given that EES and ENA can not comply with the reqts as defined.  Jim 
 Agree.  In fact this was John Anderson's only problem.  My position would be to simplify Bingaman's language to not define any organization.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Janine --  I want to make sure that our comments allow both a retail option and a wholesale option.  Let's also focus the PUCO on the fact that bidding leading to negotiations is the best solution, allows for creativity.  Jim 
 Please coordinate on this.  Jim 
 Here is my testimony.  I have one attachment that is being sent via fax.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Attached is the testimony that I filed today asking thh PUC of Texas to open the retail markets in the SPP territory.  Thanks,  Jim 
 thanks. 
 The best outcome is that there is an obligation to dispose of load through this but the mechanism is negotiated.  Jim 
 I read the same.  It was crazy.  Their solution is to tell us to do what we said didn't make sense.  We won't give the FERC made up information.  Jim 
 Thanks for the draft.  Will circulate internally and respond.  Jim 
 Here is PJM's attempt at NERC language.  I think it makes sense for us to support this.  Jim 
 My understanding is that we are going to work Ark.  Jim 
 Mary Lynne -  Do you need anything on this?  Jim 
 How about Wednesday Oct 17 next week at 9am?  Jim 
 Thanks.  No major issues.  Jim 
 Thanks but my group has an all day budget meeting.  Maybe some other time.  Jim 
 Yes.  Her name is Linda Noske. 
 Susan --  When we get to a point to make comments, please let me know.  Jim 
 What does this mean??  Jim 
  Harry & Christi --  We need to be coordinating on this.  You both met with these people at different times.  I don't want to be creating work or stepping on each other.  I don't think there is any problem, but let's sit down and coordinate.  Thanks,  Jim 
  Alan Comnes --  Please let me know what we're doing on this?  You are the Project Lead.  Go get 'em.  Jim 
 Sarah --  You're call on working with EPSA.  Get everything you can.  I don't understand how "new services" is moving fast enough.  Jim 
 Sorry.  I'll be in Austin testifying.  Jim 
 good luck 
 Guillermo -  Before you send any letters, please make sure that Steve Montovano is the in loop.  He manages that region.  Jim 
 Change the language on Operations to include ...Coordination of Service and Planning for Transmission ...  Thanks,  Jim 
 No.  Although the lack of a concrete decision is a "decision" - just not one we like.  Our goal is to get this dealt with by end of November.  Jim 
 Christi --  Some interesting language for the ICAP team.  Please forward along.  Jim 
 No.  Just wanted your thoughts.  Thanks. 
 Jeff --  In a budget meeting, will call this afternoon unless something critical.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Sorry that I didn't get to you sooner.  The head of the group is Tim Battaglia who is the best person to work with.  Jim 
 Not really.  I tried to get to talk to her but never could get an opportunity.  Jim 
 Didn't get invited.  Are you going?  I don't plan on sending anything - do you think we should even though we didn't get any invitations?  Jim 
 I'll play the cheap course.  Jim 
 Ray --  Looks very good.  We need to stress the points on what we need FERC to do -- fix their mistakes in the Rehearing.  One other point, maybe we should stress that FERC could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the Cal ISO is taking so long.  Also, don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the "abuses" of the Cal ISO and its lack of independence.  Jim 
  Jose & Charles --  Thanks for the update.  I am concerned that "customers" are talking about h= aving NERC deal with commercial matters without first agreeing to FERC's co= ntrol over everything? =20  We should discuss the Goulding Report when you return.  Jim 
 Let me know about how you intend to move forward.  Probably the same team as the CA reporting.  Also, what did AGA do with its Storage Figure Report?  I heard that they cancelled the publication.  Jim 
 Sure. 
 Thanks.  We will discuss in context of State review.  Jim 
 I'd say we want tariff language before any investigation.  I don't typicall= y like investigations.  I like complaints.  My thought is to pre-sell tarif= f changes to FERC with a broad coalition and then get the Ohio PUC to ask F= ERC the question.  Jim 
 FYI.  Call Jeff if you have more questions.  Jim 
 Does this make sense?  Jim 
 I'll go to the Houston meeting.  Jim 
 Should this go into Janine's efforts on Markets?  Jim 
 Thanks.  I want to talk about this on the "Consultants" call with Linda Robertson.  Should we push this argument or leave the FERC with its infirmities?  I believe that we can work away at many of our concerns in the "should refunds be reqd" phase.  Jim 
 Jeff --  Look at the letter.  I see no issues.  Call me with your thoughts.  Jim 
 Thanks for the information.  At this time, I don't think that I am interest= ed in any reports.  Jim 
  Please put in swepco file for thurs.  Thx, 
 Pls put in SWEPCO file.  Jim 
 Linda --  Pls include in the file.  Jim 
 Jean --  You may want to call Jeff and find out where he is going with this talk?  We still need to meet with a detailed plan on Texas.  Maybe next week or soon thereafter.  Jim 
 Pls put in my SWEPCO folder. 
 FYI 
 I think that this is a good step but we need to remember that NERC in the commercial sector may not prove to be the end all.  Also, while RTOs may enforce the standards or set the standards, not sure if we want one organization doing both.  Jim 
 Any time you want to you should feel free.  Jim 
 Did we decide not to join with anyone else?  Jim 
 HERE IS THE REPORT.  Jim 
 Great idea.  My key points would be that (a) FERC needs to push ahead with its "right sized" RTOs and (b) focus on standardizing the tariff and market design [no more collaborative efforts].  Two simple, easy to understand thoughts.  Also, I think that it's a mistake to use the term "large RTOs".  We don't want large RTOs.  We want RTOs that cover natural markets and benefit consumers.  Jim 
 Looks good.  Is there a timeline on when FERC may act (or at least when the Audit) will be final?  Is this information confidential?  Should we be working the trade press?  Thanks,  Jim 
 If FERC agrees, does this hurt our retail business and the implementation of our retail gen product next year?  Jim 
 John --  To your point #3Burr --  Probably want to bring in Steve Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is Allison Duncan) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.  Steve Montovano could probably be of assistance here.  Maybe bring in Allison to DC to deal directly with the staff?  Jim 
 Steve --  What's up with GA PSA Wise wanting to open marketers books?  Saw this in Gas Daily today.  Any info is helpful.  Jim 
 There are some Commodity meetings.  One with Jim Wood and one with Greg Sharp.  Harry, can you please call and get on these meeting schedules?  Also, Guillermo Canovas and Melinda Pharms are going to the EES gas meeting weekly.  Jim 
 Damon --  Good idea.  I'm out early next week. How about next Thursday?  Jim 
 Seems reasonable to me that we tell NERC they can't "make a land grab".  How about EPSA and ELCON signing a letter together to the Chairman of NERC Board?  Jim 
 Christi --  DQE provides some level of audit capability to ensure that the costs are fair and apppropriate.  PGE may not have a resource specific system lambda but AW may be able to explain how they would implement something like this.  I know AW from some other issues so if things don't go well  let me know.  Also, please keep Alan Comnes in the loop.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Nancy, etal --  With the discussions at NERC recently to broaden their role, I think that we need to be very coordinated on our EISB message and begin to figure out how we get AGA to work with the Retail Gas and EEI/UBR to work with the Retail Power quadrants.  Let's think about a NARUC message to drive this very quickly (maybe at the next meeting).  Having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expand our policy reach.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Are these papers consistent with Enron's positions?  Jim 
 No.  Jim Steffes 
 What do you think??  Jim 
 thanks 
 Jean --  The PUCT voted to delay for SPP markets.  Not sure about Entergy.  Any news?  Can you send out something to the business people?  Jim 
 Your thoughts?  Jim 
  It is critical to win this case.  Sounds to me that Dynegy wants ICAP in the Midwest.  Jim 
 Sounds reasonable.  Would the same be true about the DST case?  If we lose, without the PPO what do we have?  Jim 
 Pls call Steve.  Jim 
 Alan --  What about a simple price cap (ala PJM) of $250/Mwh rather than a gas-index deriviative?  Just a thought, do whatever the desk thinks is right.  Jim 
 sounds good.  pls talk with Bob Frank about his involvement in this group.  Jim 
 The first order of business is getting the cost/benefit analysis done.  Once we have that study, let's go to press.  Jim 
 23.51 
 thanks. 
 While I appreciate the concerns about the diffferences in East and West, we've waited too long for utilities to agree to make RTOs happen.  We can finesse this forever, but we need to give FERC some tools to force the process.  Jim 
 Can we have breakfast Wednesday morning at the Park Hyatt to discuss where we are and necessary next steps?  Given Southern's statements (as well as others), this is the key analysis that would hold up this from moving forward.  Jim

 ok.  I'm booked all week but next week I can do it.  Jim

 A few notes.  1.	Be cautious about divestiture.  Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.  2.	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.  3.
