to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?  3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?  4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?  5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?  6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?  7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model]  8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?  9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?  10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?  11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?  12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?  13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models 
 Nice to meet your brother.  Do you have a map of the 25th?  Jim 
 Yes this gets at my issues.  I want to build your matrix and Rebecca's together.  No where do we deal with reporting yet?  Also, we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming "point people".  Jim 
 I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.  Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.  Jim 
 Christi --  I'm out next week.  This is a bit touchy with the changes coming.  Why not have Jose agree to go  (no one else) and if necessary we'll backfill.  Jim 
 My thoughts --  1.	Great job. 2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs. 3.	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter. 4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.  Thanks. 
 LUIZ --  Attached is a version that I changed.  Mainly formattting the intro.  I think that our current draft is too long without a short synopsis up front. We want a White Paper that reads like an advocacy piece.  Please add to whatever you are doing.  Also, move forward with contacting Larry Ruff for (1) his analysis of your and my combined draft and (2) a simple affadavit on this.  Govt Affairs will pay up to $10k for this work out of our current budget.  We need to have this finished by Tuesday EOB.  CHARLES -- We need to make sure that Monday and Tuesday someone calls everyone on the Committee considering changing these rules on Thursday.  Let's get the list and start lobbying actively.  Call me if you have any questions.  Please talk with Doug Gilbert-Smith about who and where.  Maybe Christi and Jean Ryall can help.  CHRISTI -- Pls make sure that Steve Walton and Sarah Novosel are ok with this statements.  Thanks.  Jim 
 We need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any RTO - unless and until I hear something different from FERC, my going in assumption is that Enron will be one of the only voices on this issue.  We should only give on this issue when real value is being created.  Why not file a "me too" on the issue of seating of the Board w/o agreeing to everything else?  Jim 
 Not sure if there is much to do.  I was just sending this e-mail because I saw Alan working to find a copy as well as John Shelk's team - wanted to make sure we weren't duplicating efforts.  Jim 
 Ginger --  Can you please approve?  Jim 
 It's been amazing.  Jim 
 Pls pay. 
 No. 
 Jaime,  Please add James Steffes, user id is jsteffe, to the App_BlackBerry group for BB usage.  Thank you for your help,  Matthew Campbell 
 PSE&G called yesterday to ask for an LC or cash collateral of $1.0 MM to displace our Corporate Guarantee of $1.3 MM.  They are sending more information in a letter to Bill Bradford copied to me.  THere is a 5 day turnaround - early next week this will be due. 
 Yes.  He is now a big-time headhunter.  I hope you had a great Thanskgiving.  Things are crazy here.  Jim 
 Let's talk early next week. 
 Right now we are trying to develop some info and the right messages.  This is the same everywhere.  Our gameplan right now is to work this next week.  Jim 
 It sounds better on FM - you can pick up the wonderful vocals.  Didn't hear too much from Rush on the drive - he was probably in a bunker worried that the Taliban was after him.  Jim 
 Bob --  We need to pull together the rules, etc. for a change in assignment w/o consent for small commercial in NYC and TX by 3 pm tomorrow (or earlier). Grab me and we can discuss.  Jim 
 We will need to let everyone know early next week - working on msg -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Wade -  Anywhere that we have Supplier Consolidated Billing Enron put up some form of credit to cover 45+ days of Utility charges.  So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if Evan provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.  We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.  Jim 
 Password = jinglebells  Jim 
 Christi & Sarah --  Do we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.  Jim   Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means is that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes they exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred. 
 Did you hear anything on WM?  Jim 
 Julie --  Given our current situation at Enron, I wanted to let you know that we will not be able to support the SE RTO Study.  I assume that you were already thinking this.  This upcoming week should prove to be another amazing ride.  As soon as we come up for air, I'll call and fill you in on the developments.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 This is the price tag for COBRA from Enron.  Looks like $600/month.  Jim 
 FYI.  Jim 
  More info. 
  Dick --  With everything going on at Enron these days, please use the following contact information -  Jim Steffes 14354 Carolcrest Houston, TX 77079 281-759-8270 msteffes@mindspring.com  Thanks,  Jim 
 FYI 
 Chantel  --  Please call me at 713-853-7673 to assist with any questions.  Jim 
 Please keep me in the loop on developing opportunities. 
 Pls send to Mike Terraso with Environmental Policy.  Jim 
 I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.  I think we will be getting a number of these.  I would say that we will try and communicate something proactively to the PUCs around the country by Wed am.  Critical that our message is consistent and clear.  Rebecca, any thoughts?  Jim 
 Jeff --  Please don't forget to get load #s or de-DASR customers - probably 50+%.  Good info to cover our "remaining" customers.  Jim 
 FYI.  Let's deal with this early tomorrow.  Jim 
 Harry --  EES filed yesterday.  My thought is to focus on keeping our licenses so that we can return customers in an orderly fashion.  Jim 
 Christi --  When is this meeting?  Also, Dave Forester is looking for someone to present (through Rick Shapiro call).  Is this the same meeting?  Call me.  Jim 
 Mike --  Going forward, should all enviro be sent to you? 
 Please send all questions on environment to Mike Terraso.  Thanks. 
 Evan Hughes are we Dual Billing our current ConEd customers? Gloria Ogenyi will we owe more $$ if we don't switch to Dual Bill?  Scott Gahn what are the issues if we do switch?  Thanks. 
 Pls hold for inclusion in CPUC letter today.  Jim 
 Thanks.  I've enjoyed working with you and more importantly, getting to know you.  Best of luck going forward.  If you ever need any thing, please don't hesitate to call me.  Jim 
 Thanks Becky.  I've truly enjoyed getting to know you better as we've worked closer these past few months.  You've taught me alot about natural gas issues and if I can ever do anything for you please let me know.  Jim 
 Thank you -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Appreciate the thoughts.  I especially appreciate your hard work over these last few weeks.  Jim 
 Sandy --  Pls forward final CPUC letter sent today to this group.  Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 He is at the State Dept.  (202) 647-8931  SchriverRG@STATE.gov  Glad to hear things are well.  Jim 
 FYI 
 Kay --  A couple of things --  1.	Jim Steffes not Jeff Steffes 2.	My cell phone is 713-851-2499 not 2489.  Thanks. 
 Jeff pls call Bryan Gottfredson at 713-942-7307 to discuss possible job openings in CA. 
 No Yeung + Lindberg are gone -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 In speaking to the PUC today, they are under the impression that we are currently physically serving Compaq and JC Penney.  Is this right? If so, don't we want to deDASR them?  Jim 
 In OH I believe that the MSG service continues (transfers with the customers) so it's just any discount we gave above the MSG rate.  Jim 
 Good news.  Also, Rich Drom called from PJM wanting to know if someone from Enron was attending the Members Mtg this Thursday (no) and if what did we want to do with the confidentiality of our credit (I think that we should agree - not PJM's to distribute).  Your thoughts - I'll call Drom back tomorrow.  Jim 
 Thanks Ann.  Pls send to me going forward (at least as long as we're here). 
 Jeff --  Pls call. 
 I agree.  In fact, in the conversation with the Chairman of PUCT, I told him that we were sending all of our pilot load back to TXU before Jan 1.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info.  Jim 
 Ok. 
 Christi --  I want to call Susan tomorrow and let her know about the mess up on her.  But I want her to understand the issues involved.  Let's talk as soon as possible.  Jim 
 Your message was forwarded to me regarding Dan Allegretti and NPCC.   Can you please let me know what Dan's role was in the organization and any other information?  Thanks,  Jim Steffes 713-853-7673 
 Don --  Sempra called today a
