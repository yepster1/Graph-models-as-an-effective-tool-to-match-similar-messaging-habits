d to the new book by us.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Here is the information we looked at on Thursday .  It is updated for our current position.  Through looking at this you will see that our risk is to a significant up move in prices.  Currently, prices are not moving up significantly.  Thanks,  Errol

 John,  After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.  This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.  A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.  Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.  I apologize for the error.  We just found it today, when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I will be there. 
 Heather,  Can you do me a favor.  The Reward Bucks application I filled out, was for Michelle Nelson.  I will be out all of next week.  If you get it next week can you have it sent to her.  She sits behind me at 3249B.  Her extension is X5-8091.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 I have officialized the 14378 and unofficialized 14370.  Thanks,  Errol

 I think he can handle it. 
 John,  Are the 24 hr gas stacks going to be running on Thanksgiving and the Friday after (11/22, 11/23)?. EOL is asking.  Thanks,  Errol 
 hilarious 
 I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.  Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.  Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Francis,  Could you do this again for me please.  The post i.d. is 1403067.  The month is February 2003.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Please delete all 7 for the 18th only.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Christy,  EPMI-LT-WHALW-PRC GAS-ECT-STRATEG-PRC GAS-ENERGYAMER-PRC OIL-NG-HDG-CD-X-GDL  These should be included w/ the Natural Gas Financial Desk.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 EPMI-LT-WHALW-PRC and OIL-NG-HDG-CD-X-GDL are John Lavorato books.  The other two are prepay books and are not associated w/ a given trader.

 Eric,  Leg B has already terminated (06/30/1999), and legs 9 and C are in Canadian books.  I left a message w/ book admins in Canada.  As soon as they get w/ me I'll run a minibook for you on those 2 deals.  Errol 
 Mike,  What is this meeting specifically about?  Thanks,  Errol

 Anyone going?

 Christy,  I have placed the name of the book admin. by the corresponding book.  Please call me if you have any questions at X5-8274.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Kori,  Please tell me which ones are yours.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Sounds good 
 Don't know what time on Monday. 
 Jeff,  The day after Thanksgiving is NXB4.  We (Price-Desk) have some special procedures we have to follow regarding swaption expiration.  Other than that, it should not be that different from a non-bidweeek day.  I apologize, I thought the 23rd was going to be NXB3.  In December, the day after Christmas (Wednesday) is NXB2 and the Friday before that is NXB3.  Monday and Tuesday are exchange holidays.  Thanks,  Errol

 Don't worry, I'll fill you in later. 
 You doubt my stamina & my prowess in holding my liquor--et tu Brute??!!!  I'm not feeling too bad - considering the time I got home.  I didn't want to wake you.  I've been doing the meeting circuit again this morning, so that has kept me lively.  The post lunch period when things are quiet is going to be brutal though.  How is your day going? 
 Attached, please find the book request in response to Nancy's e-mail.  Please call w/ any questions.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 I read it this morning.  It's absolutely brutal towards the end.  We'll talk more offline--if you know what i mean.  e 
 Tom,  I agree w/ this position (67,016 Peak) as of last night.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Looks good.  Settlement is last nite's settle.  Errol 
 fine 
 what is this? 
 Kam,  Did Brad answer your question?  I've been in NYMEX hell all day and I am not up on this issue.  Let me know if I can help further.  EM 
 Yes, I ran his book for a while when he was head of the gas floor.  I've done some other projects for him.  Hope the e-mail wasn't too bad.  Errol

 Kam,  Did we get everything take care of for you?  EM 
 Kori,  Can you get w/ Stephen & find out what's going on w/ this.  EM 
 Tom,  The GasPow position is correct.  Thanks, Errol 
 Jeff,  I know you're pretty busy w/ everything going on, so this isn't top priority.  When you get a minute, could we talk about how Spec/Sr.Spec get into the Associate/Analyst program?  My guys (and myself for that matter) have seen and heard of people moving into the program and I am getting a lot of questions on the matter.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Guys,  Please make sure we have everything flipped out per the message below.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I haven't talked w/ him for awhile.  I will give him a call. 
 Anne,  Can you please send John Swinney the post i.d for the "ENA-FT-WT-ENA" as of 09/28/2001.  He is fulfilling an Arthur Andersen request.  Thanks,  Errol

 Anne,  Can you give John a call and get him what he needs.  I don't know anything about the request.  I gave him some of ours and he needed one of yours.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Kori,  Do me a favor and check the RAC website before you leave at night to make sure all your Post I.D.'s are official.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Working on it -- Joey is running mini-books. 
 This looks like the macro problem we talked about.  Let me know what I need to do to fix.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Sorry guys, I forgot to forward.  EM 
 Norman,  I am not able to calc using the shortcut on my desktop.  I can copy the Post-ID and set it up.  When I try to calc I get a message saying, "unable to connect".  Can you please help?  Thanks,  Errol 
 All outstanding will be granted tonite. 
 Sheetal,  Please check below regarding the New Power deal and Credit Reserve.  Let me know so I can grant tonite if this is valid for Credit Reserve.  EM 
 The Inland Production deal is a Crude deal.  Please contact the Crude Oil desk.  Sheetal Patel (the originator) is looking into the New Power deal.  EM 
 thnx 
  FYI regarding day after Thanksgiving (closed) and trading hours (9am-1:30pm) for the rest of the year. 
 Will do.

 Kam,  I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co.  I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.  No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.  Let me know how I can help.  Errol 
 Done.  Thanks,  Errol
