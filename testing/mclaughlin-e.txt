 Let me know if you get three files -- one for each subsidiary.  That was the only way I could send them out.  Errol 
 Vikas,  Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an appropriate format.    Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Jim,  I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself. Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things settle down.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Homer,  I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to Email.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Done.  EM 
 Jim,  Thanks a lot for great basket - I just got it.  We'll call on Monday.  Errol 
 The basis curves corresponding to deals listed are saved in O:\ Dropbox \Errol\natsourcebasiscurves.  I.T. is still working on a fix for the Gas Daily curves.  I will let you know when we have something from them.  I let them know this was a time sensitive issue.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Everything looks correct, except for Friday, November 23, 2001.  Truong had this day listed as a holiday.  It is not a holiday -- the exchange will close early at 12 noon CST.  Errol 
 Please find attached the file that Dawn sent to me.  Sorry for the delay. Next month I'll be more prepared.    Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Agustin,  Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274
