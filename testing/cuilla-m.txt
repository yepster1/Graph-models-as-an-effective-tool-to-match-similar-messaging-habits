 Are you drunk today - if not you need to take a typing/spelling class? 
 so you are drunk then - that is what i thought

 it probably sounds a lot more extravagant unless you know the price we paid 
 you snooze you lose!  i wouldn't mind a little room service from the guys anyway.  we can party with the peasants at the iberville and then come sleep with the kings at the ritz. 
 If I would have kept my whole EOG position it would be worth 80,000 right now.  If I would have kept half - 55,000 or a brand new bmw 540.  Instead we have an IS 300. 
 I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woman she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  After several other uses of fuck she hung up.  I switched our service to att (never thought i would be happy to be an att customer again) and called back and got another manager who claims she is taking care of it.

 I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and mic= helle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to = it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be = bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the be= tting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept askin= g are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn'= t say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool= about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are = going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I wal= k in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we = had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts l= eaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to = email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls= .  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like an= d she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you coul= d say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs. = It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that= i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weeke= nd.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it = is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20 
 Wasssup.  I just got back from vacation so still trying to catch up.  I would love to go to lunch but I have not been allowed to go to lunch for two years.  I work on the trading floor - trading natural gas - and thanks to the lovely invention of EnronOnLine (our online trading program) we have lunch delivered in everyday and aren't allowed to leave.  It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it.  Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon.  Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour.  x35933 
 prior balance = 152.50 three games @ 75 each = 225  new balance is 377.50 
 do you think dale would know it was me if i bought the ass kickin for his skeeball bitch headed no self respect self?  btw - sagarin won net 4 games (if $50/game = $150 after juice) 
 he took a total of 24 games and went 14-10 and won 150 after juice

 Storey and I were talking about different places to look for coverages and insurance for death (regarding his father).  Were are some of the non standard (ie not life insurance) coverages that he should make sure he has checked.  His dad was on a business trip from Houston to NY. 
 Hey I want to check with you about pulling $750 from our checking account to deposit into my gambling account.  No I have not lost $1,000 but I am following a model and I take all the games it says and there are more than 20 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided.  I know the next question and so far I have lost $150 but I didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and I would have won $150.  Anyway, I would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise I am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend.  On a side note, the furniture people called and said the furniture is coming in in pieces and they should have it all by November which means it would ship to us between the 1st and 3 week of November but definitely before Thanksgiving. 
 yeah we are done so we can do an annuity when ever you want 
 yes that is fine 
 thanks for the heads up kevin!

 I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

 When does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid.  I thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe I am confused.  Also, since the raise was effective starting Sept. 1, will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary?  Thanks,  Martin Cuilla

 Johnny said he is getting a big group of people to go to renaissance festival nov 3 - which i know is when coon ass et all is coming in town so thought that might be something fun to do for everyone (although $20 is kinda steep). 
 I got this email from a guy I talk to occationally in Canada - I didn't know they were getting married 
 Small world - I have talked to Gerald and Dana before about Enron people they know but don't ever remember hearing your name.  I would like to meet you, however I am going to be in Kansas hunting from November 9th through 14th. 
 Hey we are going to Truluck's for all you can eat stone crab claws tonight in honor of my 32nd birthday.  I think it is about $35 each for the all you can eat claws or they also have steak, lobster, and seafood.  Let me know if you want to go so Zooey can make the reservation (7pm).  And ken no song although i might play it tonight if i get drunk enough

 don't know what doing for new years (mentioned n.o. to z but not sure). didn't return phone call because i was in nyc and forgot when i got home.  i don't know anything about directories talk to my brother.  i don't know what the fuck. 
 Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding. 
 I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding. The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good. We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend. After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.

 Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient. Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand. Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works. Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house.

 Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score). 
 I am interested in purchasing a Huglu shotgun and would like to get a price. I am looking at the Model Au1 semi-automatic model.

 Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55  Dec 00          Mar 01    This Year - Dec 00     Next Year Dec 01  Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago	 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60	0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59	2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14	 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97	9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%

 Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already). Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me know.  Love  Hubby 
 Bobby  We are very happy that you will be participating in the celebration of our marriage!  Attached is a copy of the reading we selected for you to read.

I understand you won't be in town for the rehearsal so we look forward to seeing you before the wedding.  I am not sure when we are all meeting up but Zooey or I will talk to you on Saturday afternoon about the ceremony and when the reading will take place.  Thanks again for your help.  Martin
