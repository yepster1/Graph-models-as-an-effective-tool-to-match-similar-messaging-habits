inner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand. Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works. Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house. 
 The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the weekend.  You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone. If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820 (cell) and we will work it out.  FYI - I am also notifying the person who bid $305 and promised to give them first look but otherwise the tickets are your if you want.  Thanks,  Martin

 Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score).

 Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55  Dec 00          Mar 01    This Year - Dec 00     Next Year Dec 01  Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago	 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60	0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59	2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14	 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97	9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%

 Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already). Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me know.  Love  Hubby

Also, the rehersal dinner is following the rehersal at Buca di Beppo at around 7:30.  We hope you will be able to attend.
