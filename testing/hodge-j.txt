 Jim:  I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS desk.  Jeff    James E Keller@EES 05/21/2001 07:03 PM 
 Michelle:  The approach you have outlined is fine with me.  Thanks,  Jeff    Michelle Maynard@EES 06/04/2001 04:59 PM 
 Rick:  Got your e-mail.  Glad to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  Class reunion 2002 would be 30 years.  What do you think we should do?  Jeff    "Rick Carey" <rcarey278@home.com> 06/03/2001 09:43 PM
