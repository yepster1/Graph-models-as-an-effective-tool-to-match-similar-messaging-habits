 Mike:  Thanks for the note.  Things are pretty crazy around here, but it is clear that lawyers will be around here for quite some time.  Anyway, hope all is well with you.  My bright note this fall was the Buckeyes win over "the State Up North".  Give my best to your family.  Have a great holiday.  Jeff

 Philip:  Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron North America Corp.  Jeff Hodge 
 Lisa:  The above is an entity that does a lot of gas purchasing.  It has not yet been put into bankruptcy.  Given the various payments that have and will not be made, I think serious consideration should be given to filing for this entity.  Thanks,  Jeff
