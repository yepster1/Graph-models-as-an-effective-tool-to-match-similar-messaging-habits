 On April 21st and April 22nd, Pat Kelley from BPA prescheduling group called and informed me we were curtailed by a total of 12 mw for HE 7-22 for April 22nd at COB.  Accordingly, we purchased 12 mw from Avista to cover our position.  At 1:00 p.m, April 22, Rob called from BPA and informed me they made a mistake with the hours of the curtailment and that it was only supposed to be cut HE 7-20 and not HE 21-22.  Therefore, BPA will not charge 12 mw for 2 hours on April 22nd.  The deal numbers are as follows:  deal#153325(2mw),153327(2mw),305699(4mw) and 305700(4mw)  If you have any questions, please see me.

 Here is a recap of what happened for April 1st.  NCPA, scheduling coordinator for City of Oakland called 3/30 and 3/31 regarding the 5MW flat schedule we sold to them at NP15.  They informed me that the subject contract is terminated and therefore will not submit it through ISO.  I called Mo and Murray and they informed that the contract is still valid and therefore keep the schedule in.  ISO called 3/31 A.M and informed me NCPA and Enron will have to settle it.  Murray called NCPA and they agreed to put in the 5MW schedule for April 1.  For April 2nd and through the end of the month, we will not submit the 5MW until we hear different from legal.  Lisa 
 THANK YOU! LISA
