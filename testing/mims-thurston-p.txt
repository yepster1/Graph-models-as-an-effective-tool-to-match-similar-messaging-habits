ed about walking with Taylor.  I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.  How was your weekend?  See ya! 
 You can rest assured that I will definitely have you in my prayers.  How is everything going this morning?  What is your state of mind?  Are you feeling strong this morning or a little apprehensive?  If you are feeling apprehensive, please try and write down your questions and concerns that you have, so that you don't waste your visit by being overcome by emotions.  Call me when you get back from your visit.  I will probably be leaving here around 2:00 or so.  Call me on my cell.  Love ya! 
  Hey girl,  What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could= have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I h= ad a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they ha= d their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice= , but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.  = The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45. = I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms Thang = felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal a= ttire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, = and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by desi= gn, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that I bought set it of= f so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore my rhinestone cho= ker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, = but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show al= l my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When I came out of the b= edroom after getting dressed, Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Ma= de my evening.  Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word.  But I fe= lt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those= come out (smile). =20  We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd sai= d the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, b= ut it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!  Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was w= ondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's b= ack in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.  How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get= a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home u= ntil around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mar= t.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.  Ri= ght now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All w= e do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, ind= ependent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new= environment.  Oh well, talk with you later!  Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos! 
 Hi Dave,   Attached, please find Enron's offer for Trunkline East Louisiana volumes for the winter months ending in 2002 and 2003.  Please feel free to call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.  Thank you 
 Hi Bob,  Per our conversation this a.m., here are the notional sales prices for Nicor City Gate deliveries for the following:  Five Year Price out of January, 2004	=	$3.67 estimate  Ten Year Price out  of January, 2004	=	$.3.92 estimate  (Please keep in mind that these are ESTIMATES!!)  If you need these prices further broken out by year, please call me.  I will also forward the ISDA and Long Term Gas Purchase Agreement to you early next week.  Thanks  Patrice    P.S. You forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under,  is it Corn Products International?  Write back, because I need this information for the contracts, etc. 
 Hi Pat,  Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:  At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:  1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?  2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?  Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.  I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.  Talk to you then.   P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.  Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price. 
 Thank you! 
 Update:  I spoke with Jeff Hodge and was able to obtain a Bill of Sale document from CSN.  Jeff is currently reviewing this document and will let me know how to proceed.  I'll let you know more when I hear back from Jeff. 
 Hey girl,   I don't know what in the heck I was talking about, Nicor Enerchange did send me the correct version.  Please review and let me know what you have for them.  Thanks,  Patrice 
 Hi Bob,   Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.  Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.  I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).  Year 2003			$.3.355  Year 2004			$3.45  Year 2005			$3.54  Year 2006			$3.62  Year 2007			$3.71  Year 2008			$3.81  As far as a publication such as PIRA, that Enron would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.  Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.  P.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.  Please reply when you have a moment.  Thanks 
 Did you know......The Royster Clark Nitrogen facility was originally built and constructed by Nicor Gas Company in an effort to stabilize pressure at the East Dubuque location of their system.  Royster Clark is currently listed as the largest industrial consumer of natural gas in Illinois, burning 30,000 MMBtu/d.   Quote of the Day:  There is no "I" in TEAMWORK. 
 Yes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with you?  How are the proceedings coming along?  Everything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation, whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.  I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?  By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.  Write back!!!! 
 no i have not received yet, what time did you send? 
 Hey girl, I'm trying to print this document....is this something you scanned?  Why don't you fax it to me real quick and I'll sign immediately! 
 Thanks so much!  What about the assigment letter between Nicor Energy LLC/Kaztex/Enron? 
 Jim Simpson will be trading these locations, ENA-IM MKT Central C.G. is the book and the the book adminsitrator is Jad Doan.  I'm ust helping out and will probably continue to help out.  When do you estimate that they will be ready?  Thanks 
 Hey Melba,   A revision on Number 3, It should read:  3) NBPL/Manhattan - The interconnection between The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company and Northern Border Pipeline Company located in Cook County, Illinois (Meter No. 82).  Thanks

 Hey Lizzie, what is her address, I forgot, I need to send her a business card . 
 Get out of here!!!!  Is this an Enron company?  If so, I am so happy for you Lizzie, I will certainly miss you.  You and I have been working together for years and it's just been so comfortable! (just like "old shoes") .  I wish you well and I know you'll do a great job! 
 John,  Since Heartland Steel was sold in July, 2001, are you still involved in this deal?  Thanks  Patrice 
  Sandra,  Here is the telephone number to the place that Ken Logsdon works.  The guy listed at the bottom works for Ken. 
  Hey Jason,  I understand that you were out of the office on Friday, and I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I will call you on Monday mid-morning.  The customer has called again on Friday, and I would like to get this thing resolved.  Please work with me on this issue.  I'm not sure what Enerson's role is anymore, but we need "all hands on deck" to get this issue ironed out immediately.  My cell # is 713-851-6240 and you may call me anytime.  I'll be visiting customers, but please call and leave a message if I'm not available.  Thanks 
 Spoke too soon!---It's here!  Thanks 
 Spoke too soon....it's here! 
 Hey Rob,  I haven't heard or seen anything yet on the executed contract?  Is everything okay?  I'll be out of the office traveling next week, and I wanted to get a status before I left.  Thanks 
 Hey girl,   I'll be out of the office all next week, traveling and meeting with customers in Chicago.  Call me if you have any questions regarding Kaztex (or anything else) we have worked together on.  My cell phone is 713-851-6240. If i'm not there, please leave me a message.  Thanks for all your hard work! 
 I'm gathering the base contract as we speak, I'll get it to you asap!  Thanks 
 Hey Debra,  Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following: V17258.1 V17337.1 V17515.1  They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.  Thanks 
 Thanks,  I love this e-mail! 
 John, are your responsibilities concerning Heartland Steel fulfulled if the contract is terminated? 
 Hey Guys,   I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?  While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.  Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.  Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.  Thank you for your cooperation. 
 Hi Jimbo,  how are you?  You can tell that we're real busy at the present as evidenced by my timely response.  In answer to your question, we are still in a holding pattern.  We don't have much information, other that the same information that you see.  I would like to say yes, I have a new employer, but it seems a little too early as of yet.  Keep pulling for me, I need all the help I can get.  See ya! 
 Hi Dave,   I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m.  My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the  5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".  He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.  I'll keep pushing!  Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.   Thanks   Patrice 
 Good morning Rob,  Thanks so much, it's been a pleasure working with you.  Once the document is executed, will you please have someone fax me a copy at 713-646-3390 (also have someone call me to let me know its on its way).  Thanks again. 
 Tony,  Per our conversation! 
 I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you, and saw my typo!  (you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway, I'm pleased, I know he's not perfect, and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time, but if we grow and learn something from him, and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir, and we're actually proud of ourselves again, it'll work!!!!  Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light!  We've got much greater concerns right now!  Love ya!  P.S. I have a much needed hair appointment tonight, so I won't be home until real late, but I'll have my cell phone available. 
 Hi John,  Once again, so sorry about Enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues.  We need to fix the issue, so that it does not occur again, so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute.  I believe Sylvia may have worked on this back in March, and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy, but if you didn't here it is.  Please call if you have further questions.  Thanks 
 Thanks so much. 
 So sorry about that.....We do not have a date for you b/c the  contract does not exist as of yet.  Legal said that we could just end that sentence right after the word "transactions".  take out the language that says "including without limitation the Enfolio.......   Once you make that deletion, how long do you think it will take to have it executed and a copy faxed to me at 713-646-3390?   Thanks, we're almost there!!!!!! 
 Get our of here!!!!  That's so exciting, did they kick Dorian to the curb!  I like the professionalism that the choir with achieve under Mike.  I'm excited!  How do you feel about it,  how did Robin feel?  I know we'll be jamming!.  I just hope we don't have to sing too many V. Michael McKay originals alllllllllll the time!

 Hi Vonda   Even though, I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline, I'll try again on the S. Texas piece. If my memory serves me right, you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece.   Enron offers the following:    Period:				November, 2001 - March, 2002  Region:				Trunkline South Texas Pool  Volume:			10,000 MMBtu/d  Demand Charge:		$0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times the volume, for the right to receive the volumes on a daily basis at the Trunkline S. Texas " Gas Daily Daily" price.  Notification Time:		7:30 a.m.  Thanks 
 Hi Vonda,  Here are the October offers for your consideration.  Thanks 
 Hey Lizzie,  That deal should have been booked to Nine Energy Services, LLC.  Can you please change that in Sitara.....thanks! 
 Hey Rob,  Last time, one more change, if you will? 
 Girl, that's extremely reasonable!  I'll order mine early,  where are we purchasing them from?  P.S. Please send "Tarsha" a picture of my dress.  I think I accidentally deleted the picture of my dress, doggonit!  (You know I need to brush p on my e-mail skills.....they laugh at me all the time.) 
 Hi Stuart,  Please remove me from your mailing list.  Thanks 
 Hope, Hope, Hope,  The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about the cost, I just want to look good!)  What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as well.  That boy is a mess!  Talk to you soon!   P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color! 
 Hey lady,  Does the below referenced language work for you?  Let me know.  Thanks 
 I'll probably be there at around 7:15  or earlier if I need to, what do you think about that time? 
  Hey good morning,  How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance. 
 Hi honey,  how are you? Yes, I'm dying to get my gown?  Anytime this weekend, how about bringing it to church on Sunday.  Just put it in your car.  Love ya! 
 Hi Glen,  In an effort to expedite the execution of the parental guarantee for Cilcorp, would you please consider reviewing and utilizing Enron's form of guarantee.  I have attached a copy of the gurantee for your consideration.  Please call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.  Thanks 
  Girl,  This is a Geoff Storey deal,  I'll work on it after trading.  Thanks 
 Hey Rob,  We have one more comment for you to consider:  We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must have a definitive number of days.  Your turn! 
 Fine, I was thinking of you earlier today.  Just had a bite to eat and just sitting here surfing the net.  Looking for some good vacation spots.   just happened to be looking at Arizona for the heck of it.  How is you day going so far?  Already had lunch?  How did the car shopping trip go on Saturday? 
 I would like to be the contact for Edison Marketing & Trading.  Please let me know if this is okay.  Thanks 
 Hi,  I was a guest in your hotel on December 30th through January 1st, 2002.  I wonder if I left behind a pair of cranberry colored womens' ankle length boots (sized 8.5)  My room number was 1965.  Please respond via e-mail or by telephone.  My work number is 713-853-5772.  Thanks

 Hello Clark,   Pat Monahan of CSN asked me to forward the attached gas purchase contract to you for review.  We are currently scheduled to deliver natural gas volumes to CSN's Terre Haute facility for November 1st activity.  As a consequence, we would like to have your comments or approval as soon as possible.  My telephone number is 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.  Sorry for the rush!  Thank you  Patrice Thurston Enron North America 
 Thanks Ed,  I was visiting with Nicor and they talked about some deal on the electric side and they acted as though I knew about it....so I thought I would just inquire.  I'll give her a call.  Thanks 
 Are you going tonight?  I think I'm just going to go tomorrow.  What's happening?  What time is the shower on Saturday? 
 Here's a Kiss back at ya!!!! 
 Hey Lady,  I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".  Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.  Talk with you later!!!  Hugs 
 Girl, you know Tasha has no concept of time!!!!!!! (smile) 
 LL,  Here are my top five customers, in addition to the marketing companies that we outlined earlier in the group meeting:  Nicor  Nicor Enerchange  Cilco  Illinois Power  Royster Clarke  Thanks  Patrice 
 LL,   In compliance with my 2001 Performance Plan, I have attached a "client landscape of potential customers" to be completed by November 1, 2001.  An action plan will follow within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Thanks 
 Hope,  I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.  Hugs 
 Hi Bob,  Per our conversation, here it is!!   Here is a draft of the Master for Corn Products. 
 Clinique, it's there new one.  But is she registered under Danielle Crusoe?  They do have a registry, correct.  I'm kinda excited to know what Danielle is registered for? 
 Hey Handsome Fellas!!!!   I'm thinking about coming up  to visit Nipsco next week.  Let's talk about a PLAN!!!  Please call when you guys have time. 
 Now what location of Vickie's secret are you talking about?  And give me an example of midday, evening or morning stuff?  You just lost me! 
 Irena, I do not have MSN messenger.  I believe Kim tried to set it up earlier, but I believe she said I needed an IT person to install.  Thanks

 Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help with the kids or anything.  Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on Easter.  That's a shame!  You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful. We need to shop together more often.  Yes, I will be at choir tonight.  See you then! 
 Un un, Stan's gotta barbeque!!!!!  That chicken was "da  bomb"!!!!

 I beleive this is the final.  please have someone approve and execute, so I can set out.  Sorry, I sat on it for awhile and now its a rush.  Thanks 
 How about coming up after lunch tomorrow to wrap up CSN? 
 Cool!!! 
 Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)  I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know. 
 I'll give a hollar when I take my smoke break--what times are good for you? 
 Girl, you're a mess!  Although, you are causing me to smile "in the midst of it all".  You really do need to find this guy.  What's his full name?  Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely, someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go, go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

 Hey Louise,  How are you?  Thank you so much for your concern regarding my son.  He broke his elbow on Sunday afternoon while playing on the monkey bars.
