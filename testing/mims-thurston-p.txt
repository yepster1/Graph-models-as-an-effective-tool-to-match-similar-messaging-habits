 day yesterday was okay, Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work, I was shocked, but appreciative.  I think I might go car shopping this weekend if the weather is nice.  Speaking of church, do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million dollar house?  Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high, it probably was correct!  We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these days.  I want to see this house!  Talk to you later. 
 Boy, it looks like this is really going to be a tight, tight, race.  As far as your other issue, I would just say very professionally, that "there are 3 subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about, and they are voting, religion and salaries." and just keep it at that.  You also might want to add" I hope you can respect my stand on these subjects."  That way, you've communicated your desires in a concise, professional manner.  Talk to you later! 
 Hey Girl,  I'm back and I had a wonderful time.  Phoenix is a nice city and very easy to get around in.  The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a result I have a little cold and sore throat.  The wedding was very nice.  The wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.  The reception was "the bomb".  It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, money.  I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.  She had a reception for around 150 to 250 people.  I'm not good at looking at a crowd and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.  She had a buffet dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors, beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.  It was really nice.  Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was nice.  She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.  We went shopping and sight-seeing.  We even went to go find the grade school that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix many, many years ago.  It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know what word I'm trying to say).  Did you go to church Sunday?  If so, how was it?  I really did miss not going to church.   How was the rest of your weekend?  Kids and Steve doing okay?  I can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.  Talk to you later.  I will be home tonight, so I'll call you or you call me when we get the kids wound down! 
 Girl, I'm on my way to the airport in about 15 minutes!  I'll leave the phone on! 
 Hey girl,  I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that!  It's been up and down over here, but I'm hanging!  Hope everything is going well with you.  Did the kids enjoy Halloween?  My kids sure did.  I did not realize that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween.  I wasn't going anyway!  Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding, so I'll be back on Sunday afternoon.  Talk with you later. 
 Sorry, I arrive on Continental 1505 at 7:31 p.m. and I leave on Sunday at 11:30 p.m. on Continental. 
 November, 2000 prices 
 What's Happening?   How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway. Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.  This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.  Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?  Talk with you later! 
 Sorry, forgot the attachment! 
 Hey baby!!!  Here you go!!! 
 Yes, that's fine!  --- Is it inside the terminal or do I have to drag around on a bus to find it.  You know the cheap ones are like that! 
 That's so sweet of you to let me know, but we will not be there this weekend, we just went about two weekends ago.   I'm thinking about taking the kids to this farm out in my part of town.  My understanding is that it is open to the public, but I'm trying to get the name of the place.  Diane Cook has taken her kids there, so I'll let you know more about it when I receive the info. Jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals!!!!  (He'll probably be scared to death once we get there!)  I noticed Kreme had their Halloween party at school yesterday.  What costumes did the kids where? 
 Chicago is $0.125 an Dawn is $.245. 
 yes, cool! 
 Can we make sure we set up that appointment today?  Let me know. 
 Okay, I'll send it via the mail.  I like your new hair style, it looks good! 
 When I remember to put a new book oif checks in my purse, do you want me to make it out to you or give you cash! 
 Hi,  Welcome back, I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here, just huge price moves.  Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.  As far as Alliance gas is concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.  So make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already know about it.  Anne's number is 403-517-6270.  She will be calling each Morning.  My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom.  Please look at the Nigas Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer.  My position should be around 15 long, just enough to cover rolloff for 2 days.  If its not, please buy/sell to get me close to that number (or whatever is best depending on which way the market is going).   P.S. I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point, 4,000/day @ Sitara # 436296.  He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise. His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown.  I'll be back on Wednesday. 
 Please let me know why my VAR is $2.2 million.  My position is 108.3 short, so I need to know why the VAR is so large .  Hunter would like an answer as soon as psossible.  Thanks 
 Hi Nellie,  What's happening?  I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys, if you have not received yet, you should receive either today or Tuesday.  I made the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is $159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can split it three ways.  Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not. Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.  I spoke with Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from her yet, nor am I holding my breath.  She said her colors are burgundy and gold, if I remember correctly.  Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class for his age group.  This class is called the "Hope Team"  and it gets the kids ready for competition.  I did not realize he was that good, although I could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).  I called to inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me" Ma'm you have to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes, ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!"  Well, anyway, we'll  see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day. We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it. Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.  I was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!).  I spoke with Daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving.  Let me know what you're hearing?  Talk to you later. 
 Girl, you are good, how much do I owe? 
 How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Did you receive my response to your last e-mail?  I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not.  Nothing new going on here.  I have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of October 16th. I really haven't made any plans, but maybe we'll go visit my family in Omaha.  It's really hard for me to plan, b/c I may have to work some of the week.  I'm not sure yet, so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be interrupted.  Church services were  really good this past sunday, Pastor preached a good sermon.  Talk with you later 
 Thanks for the note, that was very sweet of you.  I always believe in helping wherever I can, b/c the next day it'll be me! 
 I just sent you along e-mail, let me know if it came over, I hope so, it took me 20 minutes to type it! 
 Where are you going? 
 Thanks for the note.  Will you work tomorrow and the weekend? 
 Girl, you know he's lying.  He's a trip, but it was a good sermon. 
 Hey baby,  Getting back to the Alliance issue, what is happening.  I know I have my nerve because I was supposed to provide a list.  Sorry, I forgot, but anyway.....................here's a list:  Nicor  Dave Brown  630-983-8676 X2106 PGLC  Dave Wear 312-240-4554 Dynegy  Scott Maxfield 713-767-8030 Duke  John Alrich 713-260-8578  You know the rest.  Call me when you get a chance 
 Jesus,  Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.  Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up. The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.    Thanks 
 Hey Home,  Just a note to tell you thanks again for being my "roaddog".  It really helped me out!  You're the "bomb"! 
 Just tried to call you.  Please call me before you leave, and yes, you probably need to leave, but where will you go?  If you go straight hme, emotions are running too high for it to be a safe environment right now.  I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right now.  You are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we normally would not do.  Please do not put yourself in that position!!!!   Please call me! 
 Here are the rates that Midwestern and NGPl gave to me about a week ago. I'll double-check the rates this afternoon.  Talk with you later 
 Judy,  I thought I was through, but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the following contracts:  Wisconsin Power & Light  96045691  WPS     96001003  Also, if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you, just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them (smile!!).  Also, do you have a copy of the GTC.  We have no idea what it is, and we're looking for the non-performance language associated with it.  Thanks! 
 Hi Jewel,  Sorry, I was not available to visit with you when you called the other day, but things have been extremely busy around here, and plus, there is very little room for privacy.  In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.  Back in the day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.  I think it's one of those things that once you "get your foot in the door", you can move on from there.  Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.  As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he has time to visit with you.  I think that by simply expressing an interest, and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step. Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.  They're actually pretty good about that!  I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.  Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!  Take care! 
 Good afternoon Rev. Jackson.  So nice to hear from you, I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured out.  Hope your day is going well.  Sometime, please tell me what "A Day in the Life of Rev. Jackson" is like at SWCBC.  Do you see alot of people all day long (during the day)?  So often, it's hard to picture the church as being active all day long.  It just seems like people attend meetings and services about twice a week in the evenings.  Funny, how we get perceptions in our heads.  My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my "book" here at work and it sure feels good.  I've always remembered what you told me during my "crisis period" and always keep those things in mind.  The one that I like the best is "Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in perfect peace".  I take that with me everywhere I go.   Well, anyway, thanks for the words of encouragement.  Appreciate it! 
 Hi Rev. Jackson  How's it going?  I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal, but I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front?  Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond.  I'll be leaving at 5:00 directly.  See you tonight! 
 Melba  Please set up the following new delivery points:  1) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Midwestern Gas Transmission Company located in Will County, Illinois  2) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America located in Grundy County, Illinois  3) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Nicor Gas Company located in Grundy County, Illinois  4) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company located in Will County, Illinois  5) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois  I'd like to have these the Natural Gas Pipeline point set up yet today, as I think we will probably start to trade this point tomorrow.  Thank you. 
 Hey Melba,  This is the description I need for the new product:  The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and ANR Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois  I need this product set up ASAP, so let me know.  Thanks so much and sorry for the rush!!!! 
 Please sign me up. 
 Russell, will you please update me on the status of the Alliance Pipeline Corporate Guarantee?  We need to have this guarantee as soon as possible, as we would like to begin flow on September 13, 2000.  Thank you 
 Hi Susan  Attached, please find the list of contracts with contract numbers.  Please provide as soon as you can, and if you don't mind, can you please give me an estimated time.  Many thanks 
 I have booked my flights, I leave on Thursday, November 2nd at 5:45 p.m. and arrive in Phoenix at 7:31 p.m. on Continental.  I leave on Sunday at 11:27 a.m. and arrive in Houston at 3:00 p.m.   How was the picnic?  We finally got some decent weather yesterday and its supposed to continue through the weekend.  See you later. 
 So nice to hear from you.  Everything here is hot, hot, hot, 107 degrees today.  Nothing new going on here, the boys are doing great, just getting really big.  I'm taking Kendall to the Dr. today to see if he has an ear infection, he was up most of the night last night (rats!).  Jordan is so cool, he taking gynmastics again and loving it.  Kendall is my little roughneck!, he reminds me of myself, he's hysterical.  I am so glad I have them!!!!  The wedding in Phoenix should be alot of fun, I think it's just going to be Mom, Me and Nelle I think.   I'm leaving the kids with Todd.  Todd has a new job where he works 12 hour shifts.  In fact, he's working with Ken Cowan, but anyway it could be from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6am,  It sucks when he's working nights, but he really likes it.  Anyway, we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me I am ready to roll.  Anyway take care, talk with you soon! 
 Hi Dexter!   Here you are! 
 Give me another couple of days, we're still checking.  Did I tell you that Carol told me she was waiting on a $1.5 million loan to come through so she could pay for Shawna's wedding, as well as take care of her business.   So you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding, (girl, you know how that goes, now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of money?)   You know Carol and Shawna are doing some type of financing of real estate, or something like that.  Ralph West came to our groundbreaking ceremony we had on Sunday and delivered a sermonette.  He is awesome.  I told him I enjoyed his sermon, and he mentioned that he was leaving for Omaha the next day.  Do you have acrobat on your computer?  I'll try to send you picture to see if it comes out.   Talk with you later. 
 I think we should all stay in the same room, especially if we get a suite at embassset suites, with a pull-out bed.  We checked it out and I can get there are 7:30 p.m. on America West on Thursday.  The rate is $305.00, a little pricey.    Did I tell you that Shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal dinner?  I'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see. 
 I spoke with Carol on Friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a room at Embassy  Suites for $39 per night.  It's supposed to be at I-17 and Greenway, wherever that is.   I'll belive that when I see it.   I probably will not bring the kids, it just seems like such a hassle.  I can understand Mom not wanting to miss work, so it seems like it will be a girls weekend.  I have not checked on flight arrangements yet, but I'll let you know.   I still want to leave on Thursdat night, so we have time for site seeing.  How much was the ticket? 
 Hey Nella,  When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".  He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.  How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food. Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.  This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.   Talk with you later 
 Hi,  How's it going?  You realize we missed our PLAYDAY for the kids this week. We need to make sure we get on schedule for next week.  Sometimes the Tuesday night choir rehearsal takes so much out of me and the boys, that sometimes we spend Wednesday recuperating (i.e. getting the boys and myself to bed early).  It's always so much better when Todd is not working and he can keep them.  Girl, what did you think of that Jon P. Kee song that Joe and that girl were singing on Tuesday.  The choir really wasn't into that one.  We just could not muster up a good sound!   Are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony? If so, let's see if some of us want to have lunch together before we head to the tent!  I'm 75% sure that I will be attending.  Talk to you later. 
 Hi Calvin   I spoke with Rickey (boy, is he long-winded!!).  Gave him the name of our credit guy, Russell Diamond.  Thank for your help! 
 Nothing has happened, it seems like he's trying to stick close to home.  I came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.   I was furious and I still am furious.  Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i came back.  I really don't want to talk to him right now.   I'll keep you posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!  See you later. 
 Girl, so now you see!  Karen just has issues!  So how are you doing?  I was on vacation on Friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today.  We were in Chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion.  The weather was great compared to Texas.  Texas is so hot!!  How's Christian doing?  My boys are doing pretty good, just growing so fast.  Tell me more about Karen whenever you get a chance.  See ya!

 Hi Melinda,  Is there a catalog that we may look at?  Thanks 
 Thank you so much for your help! 
 Thank you for the info.....I'll try some! 
 Phillip.   The following four deals are the only ones that need to new mid for NBPL:   459238  606567  689712  68792  The rest of that list is misleading, etc. etc. etc.! 
 Cool!!!  Let me know when!!! 
 Sometime after 4:30 today or anyday this week. 
 Hey Drew,  I'm working on this!!! 
 Hey Tony   My fax number is 713-646-3390.  Talk to you soon! 
 Hey Bossman,  We're still waiting on Kam to provide the P.V. Factors, she's having trouble locating, but we have the spreadsheet almost complete.  I'll send it as soon as she gets the values.   Patrice 
 Hey Dexter,   Here are your numbers!  Have a great weekend! 
 Hi Jennifer  The city gate deal is sitara # 278430.  Please let them know that we have this deal on file.  Thanks  Patrice 
 We stayed at an Embassy Suites Condo on Buena Vista Drive.  It was extremely nice!.  Where did you guys stay?  How many parks did you go to?  Did you get a chance to check out the outlet malls?  See ya! 
 Hey Brenda,  I was wondering if you guys went to Disney World yet.  We went and had a good time, although it was very hot.  Let me know. 
 Here is a copy of my itinerary.  Please forward acopy of yours so that we may coordinate.  Thanks 
 I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.  You didn't tell me how good church was on Sunday.   She said Kathy Florence really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape!  It must have been awesome!  Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?  How are things going with Steve's party and have you set a time yet?  What does he want/need  for his birthday?  I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, socks, etc.)  Talk to ya! 
 I just called my other friend, her name is Renee Lewis and her home number is 281-484-2380.  She has sang the I Believe in You and Me song mnay times before at weddings and she is familar with Kissing You, but said its a really sexy song,  Have Barbara call her because she has alot of ideas.  She's a professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs.  Take care! 
 Yes, she'snot familiar with the music, but said she would listen to the music and see what she thought, but I have put in a call to my other friend, but I know she would do it if her schedule was open, but she does is professionally, and I know there would be a charge,  I should hear something today from my other friend. 
 Hey Girl,  Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be gay, and not he's changed, but......  I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?  Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said "the hell with this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.  Talk with you later! 
 That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late night.  See you later 
 Daddy,  I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.   I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for you guys.  Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from me, nobody else is (smile).  After all, I owe you one!!  Love Bernie! 
 Yolanda gave me the name of the songs--they are  "I Believe in You and Me" by Whitney Houston  and  "Kissing You" by Faith Evans 
 Yes, I'll ask her, but I also know someone else that sings at weddings professionally!  Do you know what song? 
 No, I don't know her number. but Anessa is , huh!  Just call up to the church and give them your count for dinner for the kids. 
 Hey Robert,,  Sorry I was out on vacation, and I did not think to ask Todd the name of his headhunter, but I will and try to get back to you with some names this week.  Take care! 
 Hey Girl,  Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  See you! 
 Test message, I wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it,  my e-mail is acting up, so before I re-type this, I want to see if you get this! 
 Hey Bobbi,  Here is a revised nomination sheet for March, and also, I know you'll be shocked, but I sent the contract to the lawyers for approval, so we should get it back shortly!  See ya 
 Hi Roni  Charnella had asked that I send you information regarding scooters.  The outfit is called Scoot Around North America.  They have a web site at www.scootaround.com.  Their phone number is 1-888-441-7575.  Hope this works out for you.  Take Care! 
 I'm sorry, I came looking for you on Friday at 3:00 p.m.  I thought I had responded to you and indicated that Friday at 3:00 was okay, but I checked my e-mails and discovered that I did not respond.   Anyway, my fault, what's good for you next week?  ( I promise I'll respond when you e-mail me back, instead of just putting it on my calendar.)  Thanks 
 Hi Marlo,  This deal was done on Enron Online, so do we need to get further information from Enron Online?  Please let me know? 
 Hey Sugar Bear!   I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay for you.  I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.   How's Erika doing?  You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron Burr) from the church.  You remember he was the one that used to sit on the front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.  You remember him, anyway they hauled his tail out of there.  It was terrible to see someone hauled from the church, not matter what the situation is.  Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!! 
 So nice to hear from you.  I miss not being able to see you and talk with you on a regular basis.  I hope the kids are dong fine.  Jordan went to children's church this Sunday and he definitely asked about Taylor.  He just starts smiling when I mention her name.  That little mannish boy already likes girls, I think.    Anyway, things are going okay, I'm still leaning toward trying to find a part-time position next year.  This job is so very hard!  Take care! 
 Thanks for the schedule.  If the game with Seattle is still available on Thursday, April 5, I would love to use the seats.  Thanks for your help!!! 
 Sorry, can't do it on Thursday, but what about Friday sometime? 
 It s/b sitara # 695208. 
 Hi Jeanie,  What is your schedule looking like for this week or next in the late afternoon? 
 Thanks for the "words of encouragement".  I just sent an e-mail to my Human Resources Rep and will wait to get a response.  I am so READY!!.  I've set up a meeting with my financial advisor for tomorrow to go over things again since I really have made up my mind.  Talk with you tonight! 
 Hi Jeannie,  Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time employment. I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within the company.  I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a strong interest in part-time employment.  Please let me know if anything comes up, and also if we need to meet.  I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment ( please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm interested in part-time employment.  I've casually mentioned this to him in the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.  Thanks for your help! 
 Sorry, it took so long to respond to the e-mail.  Hope, you guys are doing well! Yes, I'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees!  We really need to get something out pretty soon to the people.  Grandpa says people are calling, (I wonder if its just one or two people), but nevertheless, we still need to get something out.  Talk with you soon! 
 Hey,  How's it going today?  I've been thinking about you and Siera.  Did things go alright last night.  Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or are you not going to know anything until tomorrow? I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk to you tonight.  Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.  I thought that was funny, he said they had told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything.  He then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because I was a generous contributor.  I then proceeded to give him a piece of my mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church. By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.  That's interesting.  I can only imagine what happened there!  Anyway, do you have your African attire yet?  I have some, but it's old, and I had been thinking about buying something new.  I might go to Sharpstown and have a look, but that is not set in stone.  It depends on what type of time I have and what type of mood I'm in.  You know we're supposed to wear our African attire on Sunday.  You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m.  I'm pretty sure I won't be attending.  I'm tired of going to the same places.  We need some variety.  Gregg needs to get some new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings.  And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.  If we have to sing "In the Sanctuary"  one more time, I'm going to throw up.  I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off. It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.  See you later!!!!! 
 In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel of 1%.  Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct procedure.  Thanks for your help.  P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail . 
 Yes, it is working, you're up early this morning, it's not even noon yet. You must be feeling good today! 
 As far as vacation, I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach, VA. and just renting a house on the beach.  I've never been there, but have heard a few good things about it.  I'm trying to get more information before I go ahead and book a house.  Also, with my dad being sick, I've been somewhat reluctant to do it, because we always take a family trip each year.  God is good, so he'll probably get a chance to go.  Have you made any plans yet?  If you do, make sure and plan something leisurely.  Also, yes, we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY. They all seem to get along real well.  So my girl, has good taste.  I knew she had it in her.  I really, really like my Tahoe.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It took me about a month to get used to it, but now I'm rolling.  Tell your sister I said hi, and let me know when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time.  I would love to get together again. 
 So nice to hear from, it is indeed always a pleasure.  I can't wait until we can get together and have a chance to really chit chat.  We're always so busy, "A woman's work is never done".  I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself, I had a customer in town and had to take him out to dinner, since he's one of my biggest customers.  I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend, are you guys working on Monday, President's Day?  I'm off and can't wait.  I will certainly keep you in prayer, my child.  Love you!!  . 
 I certainly will, I know you can't wait to go home and begin your life!!!! 
 Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?  Were you trying to e-mail me yesterday?  I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as well?  I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.  They seem to be fine.  Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.  You know I always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.  The number is 713-851-6240.  When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but anyother time, it's most always on.  And of course, my pager number is on my business card.  Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.  Talk with you soon. 
 Just in case, I have not made it real PLAIN, you deliver an AWESOME Video, It is extremely professional, easy to follow, and concise!  Keep up the GOOD WORK!  Thanks again!!! 
 Hi there!  Just checking on you.  Did you make it to practice last night and did Lucretia's husband keep the kids? (smile).  If so, what time did you get back home, I know it was late.  I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what they had in the way of western attire for the kids.  They did not have much, and the hats for $2.99 were on back order.    I was looking for western shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a Western store on Gessner.  Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high. Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.  I walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear.  I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on my headphones.  It sure helps alot.  I can get away with it, because we have certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear headphones to hear, so it looks good.  Plus, the boss doesn't mind.  We listen to music just about all day anyway.  Have you heard the Chester D.T. Baldwin tape.  I think it's one of my favorites.  Speaking of gospel, is your family  still planning on  doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for the family reunion?  I was wondering about that!  Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her business.  Talk with you later! 
 Hi  I'm reponding on behalf of myself and Hunter Shively.   Hunter will be out of the office on Tuesday, and I will have a visitor in the office from Nicor on that same afternoon.  Thank you for the invitation! 
 I don't know where that came from, it's old,  but it reminds me of that song, "Hey Little Walter!"  My dad called last night and he had a terrific day on Sunday.  GOD is good! 
 Hi Shielah,  I agree with changing the deal to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily-Daily Flat for the December 22-26 time period.  Please ask Julie to change the ticket, I always get confused.  Thanks 
 That is WONDERFUL!!!!!! 
 Did you check with Steve about the rodeo on February 18th?  I want to try to get tickets this evening.  Talk to you later. 
 Just checking up on you to see how you're feeling.  Are you feeling alright? How did the last test go? 
 Do you all have any rodeo tickets?  I'm thinking about going to stand in line?  I want to see Destiny's Child, what about you? 
 Yes, We're going home to Omaha tomorrow morning, we'll be back on Monday. Take care and Happy Easter! 
 Alright, I'll check into both places.  I thought you were going to the Dr. today?  After I typed this, I said to myself, I guess I could have re--read your original memo.  Anyway, how often do you check your e-mail at home, because I can start using this to talk to you? 
 Hey girl,  How's it going?  Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two days.  I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home until 11:00 p.m.  By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight and I was sick about keeping them up that late.  Last night, I went to the grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was tired.  This evening I made a nail appointment.  My nails look like "do-do".  I would like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for that.  Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.  Talk with you later! 
 Hi Daddy,   I was thinking about you earlier this morning.  Glad to hear that you are not in any pain right now.  We just need to keep pressing to find the right combination of medicine.  My experience has been to be very persistent with the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.  I've learned alot with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not communicate.  I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done.  I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your "breakthrough" on the radio.  I told her, if only the audience knew what you were talking about!  I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were closed,I forgot about the time difference.  I 'm probably hesitating because I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this is the right place.  What are your thoughts?  Well anyway, good luck on the "butt procedure", boy you and your butt".  Hope it's not too painful.  Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening.  Is this your home e-mail or your office? 
 Hey girl,  Where are the pictures, they were not attached.  I'll call you this afternoon.  Patrice 
 I bought a car, please do not e-mail me anymore! 
 I plan to withdraw 500,000 for the month, I will revise sheet as we revise the volumes, but the plan is to withdraw 500,000.  Thanks 
 P.S. Kelli is going to send the Midcontinent volumes & prices. 
 Sorry, I got a little trigger happy! 
 How did it go with Lil' Steve.  Were you able to get his fever reduced?  Poor thing, I hope he's feeling better.  How Siera?  Well, anyway, just was thinking about the kids and thought I'd drop you a line.  Are you rehearsing tonight? 
 Hey Lizzie  Nicor is correct, Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price flat, while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus $0.01.   I have revised both tickets.  Thanks for your help, and also thank Darla. 
 Hey Kenny.  Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's not real good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn out.  Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many places).  He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight, but he's in good spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see your parents going through this kind of suffering.  He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, along with lots of prayer.  Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.  Talk to you later! 
 Hey girl,  You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name.  I called her cell phone and left a message and it gave her real name, not her slave name.  I cracked up!  Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.  That reminds me when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.  I answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there, and She said, oh that's for me".  I cracked up!  Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was Patrice.  Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?  He's back down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.  He's turned into a nice looking young man.  I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.  She seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.  I'll call her back one of these days when I have more time.  Missed you at Jordan's party.  Silly me, I didn't figure it out until Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.  I initially thought it was from Shayla.  Well anyway, you rolling? 
 Grant,  Please review and let' discuss how to resolve.  Thanks 
 I'm thinking that I have probably missed you, but anyway, it was so nice to hear from you.  We're haviing Jordan's birthday party tonight.  So thwat's what we'll be doing this weekend!   Talk to you soon!  Love Bernie 
 Hey Gang,  I've called the trader at Sempra and she is researching and will let us know something, hopefully, this afternoon.  Thanks 
 Well, go with Startech's invoice.  Thanks 
 Hi Priscilla,  These deals are a mess,  I remember issues with the deals, but unfortunately, can't remember all the details.  I will speak with our Calgary office, as well as, our Operations Manager, George Smith, and provide details to you ASAP.  Unfortunately, I think the ASAP won't be until Monday, as George Smith is out of the office until Monday.  Thanks, 
 Oh no, nothing urgent, I just feel like i take one step forward and two steps backward,  you know the drill! 
 Hope,   You're the Best!!!!!! 
 Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing. Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home.  See ya! 
 Cool girl, that'll work out fine.  It sounds like Hope will be attending also.  Kenny can't come, so that was disappointing, but I'll see him on Saturday for his daughter's party.  Talk with you later.  We need to talk!!!! 
 Hey lady,  Just in case you are interested, I changed Jordan's party to this Friday night at 6:45 p.m. same place.  Love ya! 
 It will be at 6:45 p.m.   Todd had such a fit because it was on a Monday, which I prefer! 
 Just wanted to confirm  that you guys are available on Friday night for Jordan's party.  You never did call me back! 
 Thank you.  You may call the other product NGPL Nicor GDD.  Thanks again! 
 Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal tonight!!!!! Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church, and I looked for you in the audience, but did not see you.  After church let out, I was gone, I was home by 1:15 p.m.  That never happens!  I looked for you guys and I said, oh well, I'll catch them later.  By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 22, 2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway,  Yes I'm having it on a Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and Jordan has his heart set on it.  It's always too crowded and it drives me crazy!  So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. and be out of there by 8:30 p.m.  It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday or a Sunday.  I'm just inviting about 6 people. so it'll definitely be small Let me know if you're interested.  See you soon!. 
 Hi Melba,  Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:  The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois.  I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.  I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.  Thanks Melba! 
 I already purchased the vehicle.  Thank you 
 Hey Greg,  Please forward to Ms. Bobbi.  Thank you 
 Hey,  I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there you were.  Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see where it ends up.  Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.  He still is extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.  I suspect that there is alot that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.  But I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.  I'm going down there next month.  We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.  Todd wants to drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.  He's drive us crazy!  Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are you off?  I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, but she's hanging in there.  See you later! 
 I want to make sure we're on the same page concerning the Asset Management Deal.  Please review and let me know what you think! 
 On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas flow on  December 22-26, 2000.  The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone.  The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December 22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd.  While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information. 
 Thank you,  my boss had me on a rush project and he was stressing me out.  Thanks again! 
 For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for activity for December 22-26, 2000.  The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.  Specificially the following trades were transacted over the telephone:  Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor   The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most companies observed the company holiday on December 26th.  As a result, volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.

 sounds perfect, -- do you need cash or is a check okay? 
 Hi Monique,  We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.  Natasha and I attend the same church and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same place.  What a coincidence!  To top it all off, I received an e-mail from Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to send her an e-mail".  Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.  I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, and a black liquid eyeliner.  Please let me know if you have these items in stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!  Thank you so much.  Patrice X35772 
 You go girl, you're in my prayers! 
 Hi Dan  This memo shall confirm our agreement to deliver 3,000 MMBtu's per day to National Steel for the above referenced time period.  Deliveries will be at the NGPL Nipsco City Gate.  Call if you have further questions.  Thanks 
 Oh Hope,  So nice to hear from you!  I think about you all the time.  I miss not seeing you every Tuesday!  Are you considering coming back any time soon?  If not, I certainly understand, we are so "messy".  We just finished "Take it to the Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year. We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day. A big improvement over last year, although they wanted us there at 11:00 that morning.  I just bought a new truck for me and the kids, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe. I really like it, but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that big, and it sits so high, whoa!!  I certainly am praying, just as you are, that the kids are doing great and everything is going great for you.   We'll have to get together and do a "afternoon at the park" with the kids.  Take care.  Love ya!  P.S. Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll e-mail more often! 
 Call id you have any discrepancies.  Thanks 
 Yes, I'll see you there!
