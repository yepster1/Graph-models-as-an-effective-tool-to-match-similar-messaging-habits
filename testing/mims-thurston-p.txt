 Yes, I'll see you there! 
 What's happening?  How's your day going so far?  Mine is pretty good so far, we'll see at 2:10 p.m. when the Nymex closes.   Are you doing rehearsal tonight?  I still need to get me a good black dress, I really liked your red dress.  I need something on that order .  See you later!!!! 
 I heard they closed the schools because of too much snow!  What's it look like? 
 The lady's name is Charlene Jackson.  I don't know here, but give her a call and check it out.  See you Sunday! 
 I really don't remember the name, but it was a man.  He specifically quoted dollar amounts of $9,475.808.18 vs. $9,298,971.71.  Hope this helps!  Thank you very much1 
 Test message, I wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it,  my e-mail is acting up, so before I re-type this, I want to see if you get this! 
 Val,  What is this e-mail about, did you mean to send it to me?  Send me some of those funny jokes that are going around.   Talk to ya later! 
 Hi Darla,  Could you please help me out?  Someone from Nicor called me last week and said we had a discrepancy for September business.  All he said was that there is a difference of $176,836 that we owe them.  Can you give me a general idea of what the discrepancy is?  Thanks for your help. 
 Scott,  Finally, here's the resolution on the Coenergy invoice for April, 1999.  Coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $2.90 vs. $2.74 on 10,000 MMBtu per day.  If this is true, please pay the difference of $0.155 to Coenergy on a volume of 10,000 MMBtu per day for April, 1999.  If your understanding is different, please let me know, but otherwise please pay the difference.  Thank you for your patience, and sorry it took so long to resolve. 
 Hey Daddy,  What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!!! Things here are a little exciting, they are asking us to spend the night in one of the hotels downtown, as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight. So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.  So needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.  The boys are going over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I will just stay downtown.  I understand that you guys had some bad weather as well, I know Mom was out of school.  I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it so much.  Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.  Todd bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now. It's really cute.  On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.  It was just  a new experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.  Anyway, I'll send your tape.  See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis  Love  Bernie 
 How are you doing today?  Boy, isn't it cold!!!!!!  I don't think I will be at choir rehearsal tonight because of work.  Isn't the Christmas program Sunday?  I can't believe we are so ill-prepared.  We've only had two non-dedicated practices for the program.  We are required to spend the night downtown tonight (I'll be at the Double Tree Allen Center) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not being able to get in tomorrow morning.  It's supposed to rain or lightly mist tonight between 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.   The streets are supposed to be treacherous if this thing materializes, so be very careful, in fact, you might want to talk with your supervisor  to come up with a contingency plan for the weather.  Anyway, that's all for now, talk with you later!

 What's happening?  I know you've been busy, I remembered that Thursday night is Ciera's (spelling?) review night.  Everything is well here at work and at home.  I 'm leaving early today, probably, around 3:00 p.m.  We've had a pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week..  Next week is really supposed to be cold here and in the Midwest, so it will really be a busy work week.  I think I might try to stop at the mall sometime today, whether it be late tonight (you know they're open until 11:00 p.m. I think) or right after work.  I will pick up a gift certificate from Victoria's Secret for Samantha if I make it out.   Do you want to go in on it, I was going to spend  about $25 (believe me, she is looking for a gift!).  Have you made a decision on the Christmas Party?  We're still going to mine, but girl, we have to take the kids over to Todd's mother and she lives in Bear Creek and then drive all the way back to Enron Field.  My regular babysitter could not do it.  Anyway, holler at me! 
 Please attached! 
 Hi Melba,  While we're in the midst of creating new products, will you please set up a new product called:  NGPL North Shore Gas Company.  The description should be:  The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North Shore Gas Company .  It should be mapped to Chicago.  I would like to use this product tomorrow as well.  Thanks for your help!  P.S.   Also, you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor.  Thanks 
 Girl, you cracked me up talking about the "holler" .  Now you know I don't know.  It was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead.  He probably won't spring it on you Sunday, because we did not do that good without you there.  I am so tired from last night.  Everything is so rushed, and I did not get the kids in bed until 10:35 and then I had to get them up at 6:00 a.m.  I'm tired, so I know they are.  On top of all of that, the market is up another $1.00 today (yeah!!), but we have to stay late tonight  to go over our positions as a group.  My boss said that we will all stay until it's done, so make arrangements.  Naturally, Todd is working the evening shift, so I'm trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter.  They just live right down the street.  So we'll see!  Talk with you later! 
 Bobbi,  Here is the final for March, 2001, I'm preparing the April, 2001  sheet as well! 
 Please see attached! 
 Greg set me up a nice little sheet.  So here is the updated version with new volumes! 
 No, but let me see what I can come up with.  It's early now, so it will be about another hour before they start to show up here in the office.  I'll let you know. 
 Attached are the Chicago prices.  The Michcon and Consumers are coming later. 
 Bobbi,   Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November, 2000.  I have also attached a tentative schedule for December, 2000 for both the firm and interruptible.  Those schedules will probably be revised once we get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos".  Thanks 
 It's about time, but well worth the wait.  He's is soooooo cute! 
 Well, hell, I forgot the attachment!  Here it is........ 
 We sold Steve a package of 10,000 at the Nipsco city gate.  Thanks for your help! 
 This is super fantastic!!!  See, it all pays off!  I can't wait to talk with you and find out more about it!  Let me know if you are rolling tonight! 
 Sorry, it took so long!  It's kind of hard to say, but just say that during an altercation ......, but you do not have to say with who, I really don't know, but let me know what you come up with.  How much detail  are they looking for with the Police report! 
 Hey guys,  Here is the activity sheet for November.  All activity is for the Balancing Agreement only!!!!!  I am planning to inject approximately 15,000 MMBtu per day for the rest of the month and that should put me in a pretty good position.  Please respond when you have a minute.   Thanks 
 I can't do anything on Tuesday nights, but let me know about Monday.  I just need a couple of days notice. 
 Hey thanks for the info.   Ann, from Alliance, said that 160,000 MMBtu/d went to Peoples, so, it's all making sense.  Thanks again! 
 So, I'm glad we see "eye-to-eye" on that one regarding Razoo's !  Robin and Anna have the strangest way of doing things.  I asked Robin at least two weeks ago, and she said she had to get with Anna, and now she's telling you that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to me.  Let me see if I can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again, because at this point, I'll need a sitter b/c Todd has the work Friday night, and he'll be tired on Saturday (although that's no problem).  But, like last time, I don't want to go if you can't go.  Let me try and call her and we'll talk later.  So are you free on Saturday?  Also, everything is going okay over here, the market is down severely this morning, so we'll see! 
 My id is pmims 
 That's news to me!  I don't think I like Razoo's.  I'll have to see if I'm available. 
 Yes, Sorry, forgot to mention it to you, but nothing was set in stone.    In fact, I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you.  Are you free?, are they free?, I don't even know if I'm free.  What did they say? 
 So hello,  What happened at rehearsal last night?  I did not make it, partly because I was tired and I had several errands to take care of.  I needed to stop by K-Mart and the grocery store last night to get things I really needed, and just did not want to be out late.  Let me know!!!  Talk to you later.  P.S. is everthing else going okay? 
 Hey Rev. Jackson,  Hello sir, how are you?  Well, I tell you Pastor really outdid himself yesterday.  I really enjoyed his sermon.  He really has a knack for weaving a story and making it applicable to today's events, etc.  Tasha and I got so tickled, watching you sing that song.  You did very well. We said, "Look at Rev. Jackson, he's jammin".  Well, anyway, talk to you later! 
 Hey girl,  What's happening?  Girl, remind me, just in case I have a memory lapse, that I will never, ever go back over to that church again.  It's a nice, small church, but those folks crack me up.  Last time I went, Sharon Mahon, sat next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring.  This time, those fools sitting by me (audrey and Doren) had me laughing, especially Audrey. They're fools!  I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out!  So, just remind me, I will never go back over there.   I sure hate that you missed seeing the baptismal pool!  Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.  Last night, Todd cleaned out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.  I was a little unnerved, especially with the kids.  I had the kids put on their shoes and socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.  I was a praying sister. That really scared me.  Then, to top it off, the weather got really cold this morning!  Oh well, talk with you later! 
 What's up with this guy.  I guess he called Mr. Palmer.  How did that come about!  He really feels as though he's been mistreated.  I don't understand him! 
 Girl, did you see Jesse Jackson on TV.   You know how they have the news on around here, and Jesse came on and said, "In order to have a RECOUNT, you have to have the FIRST COUNT, and it's not a black and white issue, its a wrong or right issue".   Always trying to rhyme!   Can you believe that idiot.  I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention.  I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause", but his credibility is suffering, because he's involved in every DAMN thing.  If you're an authority on everything, you cannot be passionate about much at all.  He's something else.  He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!!! 
 When you here from Hope, please let me know what she says about Greg's house and get the address and I'll print out the MapQuest. 
 Hi Mark,  I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance Pipeline.  As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.  As with any new pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.   I would like to create a product that has a description that addresses the uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.  Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.  I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.  Thank you 
 Girl, isn't that sad about the election results and the recount.  It's really terrible.  Everybody over here is watching it very, very closely.  They really want Bush to win in a bad way.  I'm tired of hearing about it!   How are things over your way.  My day yesterday was okay, Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work, I was shocked, but appreciative.  I think I might go car shopping this weekend if the weather is nice.  Speaking of church, do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million dollar house?  Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high, it probably was correct!  We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these da
