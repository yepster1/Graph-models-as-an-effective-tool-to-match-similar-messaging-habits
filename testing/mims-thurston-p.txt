new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings.  And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.  If we have to sing "In the Sanctuary"  one more time, I'm going to throw up.  I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off. It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.  See you later!!!!! 
 In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel of 1%.  Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct procedure.  Thanks for your help.  P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail . 
 Yes, it is working, you're up early this morning, it's not even noon yet. You must be feeling good today! 
 As far as vacation, I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach, VA. and just renting a house on the beach.  I've never been there, but have heard a few good things about it.  I'm trying to get more information before I go ahead and book a house.  Also, with my dad being sick, I've been somewhat reluctant to do it, because we always take a family trip each year.  God is good, so he'll probably get a chance to go.  Have you made any plans yet?  If you do, make sure and plan something leisurely.  Also, yes, we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY. They all seem to get along real well.  So my girl, has good taste.  I knew she had it in her.  I really, really like my Tahoe.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It took me about a month to get used to it, but now I'm rolling.  Tell your sister I said hi, and let me know when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time.  I would love to get together again. 
 So nice to hear from, it is indeed always a pleasure.  I can't wait until we can get together and have a chance to really chit chat.  We're always so busy, "A woman's work is never done".  I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself, I had a customer in town and had to take him out to dinner, since he's one of my biggest customers.  I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend, are you guys working on Monday, President's Day?  I'm off and can't wait.  I will certainly keep you in prayer, my child.  Love you!!  . 
 I certainly will, I know you can't wait to go home and begin your life!!!! 
 Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?  Were you trying to e-mail me yesterday?  I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as well?  I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.  They seem to be fine.  Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.  You know I always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.  The number is 713-851-6240.  When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but anyother time, it's most always on.  And of course, my pager number is on my business card.  Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.  Talk with you soon. 
 Just in case, I have not made it real PLAIN, you deliver an AWESOME Video, It is extremely professional, easy to follow, and concise!  Keep up the GOOD WORK!  Thanks again!!! 
 Hi there!  Just checking on you.  Did you make it to practice last night and did Lucretia's husband keep the kids? (smile).  If so, what time did you get back home, I know it was late.  I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what they had in the way of western attire for the kids.  They did not have much, and the hats for $2.99 were on back order.    I was looking for western shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a Western store on Gessner.  Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high. Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.  I walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear.  I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on my headphones.  It sure helps alot.  I can get away with it, because we have certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear headphones to hear, so it looks good.  Plus, the boss doesn't mind.  We listen to music just about all day anyway.  Have you heard the Chester D.T. Baldwin tape.  I think it's one of my favorites.  Speaking of gospel, is your family  still planning on  doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for the family reunion?  I was wondering about that!  Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her business.  Talk with you later! 
 Hi  I'm reponding on behalf of myself and Hunter Shively.   Hunter will be out of the office on Tuesday, and I will have a visitor in the office from Nicor on that same afternoon.  Thank you for the invitation! 
 I don't know where that came from, it's old,  but it reminds me of that song, "Hey Little Walter!"  My dad called last night and he had a terrific day on Sunday.  GOD is good! 
 Hi Shielah,  I agree with changing the deal to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily-Daily Flat for the December 22-26 time period.  Please ask Julie to change the ticket, I always get confused.  Thanks 
 That is WONDERFUL!!!!!! 
 Did you check with Steve about the rodeo on February 18th?  I want to try to get tickets this evening.  Talk to you later. 
 Just checking up on you to see how you're feeling.  Are you feeling alright? How did the last test go? 
 Do you all have any rodeo tickets?  I'm thinking about going to stand in line?  I want to see Destiny's Child, what about you? 
 Yes, We're going home to Omaha tomorrow morning, we'll be back on Monday. Take care and Happy Easter! 
 Alright, I'll check into both places.  I thought you were going to the Dr. today?  After I typed this, I said to myself, I guess I could have re--read your original memo.  Anyway, how often do you check your e-mail at home, because I can start using this to talk to you? 
 Hey girl,  How's it going?  Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two days.  I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home until 11:00 p.m.  By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight and I was sick about keeping them up that late.  Last night, I went to the grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was tired.  This evening I made a nail appointment.  My nails look like "do-do".  I would like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for that.  Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.  Talk with you later! 
 Hi Daddy,   I was thinking about you earlier this morning.  Glad to hear that you are not in any pain right now.  We just need to keep pressing to find the right combination of medicine.  My experience has been to be very persistent with the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.  I've learned alot with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not communicate.  I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done.  I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your "breakthrough" on the radio.  I told her, if only the audience knew what you were talking about!  I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were closed,I forgot about the time difference.  I 'm probably hesitating because I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this is the right place.  What are your thoughts?  Well anyway, good luck on the "butt procedure", boy you and your butt".  Hope it's not too painful.  Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening.  Is this your home e-mail or your office? 
 Hey girl,  Where are the pictures, they were not attached.  I'll call you this afternoon.  Patrice 
 I bought a car, please do not e-mail me anymore! 
 I plan to withdraw 500,000 for the month, I will revise sheet as we revise the volumes, but the plan is to withdraw 500,000.  Thanks 
 P.S. Kelli is going to send the Midcontinent volumes & prices. 
 Sorry, I got a little trigger happy! 
 How did it go with Lil' Steve.  Were you able to get his fever reduced?  Poor thing, I hope he's feeling better.  How Siera?  Well, anyway, just was thinking about the kids and thought I'd drop you a line.  Are you rehearsing tonight? 
 Hey Lizzie  Nicor is correct, Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price flat, while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus $0.01.   I have revised both tickets.  Thanks for your help, and also thank Darla. 
 Hey Kenny.  Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's not real good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn out.  Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many places).  He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight, but he's in good spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see your parents going through this kind of suffering.  He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, along with lots of prayer.  Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.  Talk to you later! 
 Hey girl,  You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name.  I called her cell phone and left a message and it gave her real name, not her slave name.  I cracked up!  Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.  That reminds me when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.  I answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there, and She said, oh that's for me".  I cracked up!  Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was Patrice.  Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?  He's back down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.  He's turned into a nice looking young man.  I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.  She seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.  I'll call her back one of these days when I have more time.  Missed you at Jordan's party.  Silly me, I didn't figure it out until Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.  I initially thought it was from Shayla.  Well anyway, you rolling? 
 Grant,  Please review and let' discuss how to resolve.  Thanks 
 I'm thinking that I have probably missed you, but anyway, it was so nice to hear from you.  We're haviing Jordan's birthday party tonight.  So thwat's what we'll be doing this weekend!   Talk to you soon!  Love Bernie 
 Hey Gang,  I've called the trader at Sempra and she is researching and will let us know something, hopefully, this afternoon.  Thanks 
 Well, go with Startech's invoice.  Thanks 
 Hi Priscilla,  These deals are a mess,  I remember issues with the deals, but unfortunately, can't remember all the details.  I will speak with our Calgary office, as well as, our Operations Manager, George Smith, and provide details to you ASAP.  Unfortunately, I think the ASAP won't be until Monday, as George Smith is out of the office until Monday.  Thanks, 
 Oh no, nothing urgent, I just feel like i take one step forward and two steps backward,  you know the drill! 
 Hope,   You're the Best!!!!!! 
 Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing. Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home.  See ya! 
 Cool girl, that'll work out fine.  It sounds like Hope will be attending also.  Kenny can't come, so that was disappointing, but I'll see him on Saturday for his daughter's party.  Talk with you later.  We need to talk!!!! 
 Hey lady,  Just in case you are interested, I changed Jordan's party to this Friday night at 6:45 p.m. same place.  Love ya! 
 It will be at 6:45 p.m.   Todd had such a fit because it was on a Monday, which I prefer! 
 Just wanted to confirm  that you guys are available on Friday night for Jordan's party.  You never did call me back! 
 Thank you.  You may call the other product NGPL Nicor GDD.  Thanks again! 
 Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal tonight!!!!! Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church, and I looked for you in the audience, but did not see you.  After church let out, I was gone, I was home by 1:15 p.m.  That never happens!  I looked for you guys and I said, oh well, I'll catch them later.  By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 22, 2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway,  Yes I'm having it on a Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and Jordan has his heart set on it.  It's always too crowded and it drives me crazy!  So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. and be out of there by 8:30 p.m.  It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday or a Sunday.  I'm just inviting about 6 people. so it'll definitely be small Let me know if you're interested.  See you soon!. 
 Hi Melba,  Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:  The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline Company located in Will County, Illinois.  I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.  I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.  Thanks Melba! 
 I already purchased the vehicle.  Thank you 
 Hey Greg,  Please forward to Ms. Bobbi.  Thank you 
 Hey,  I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there you were.  Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see where it ends up.  Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.  He still is extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.  I suspect that there is alot that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.  But I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.  I'm going down there next month.  We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.  Todd wants to drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.  He's drive us crazy!  Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are you off?  I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, but she's hanging in there.  See you later! 
 I want to make sure we're on the same page concerning the Asset Management Deal.  Please review and let me know what you think! 
 On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas flow on  December 22-26, 2000.  The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone.  The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December 22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd.  While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information. 
 Thank you,  my boss had me on a rush project and he was stressing me out.  Thanks again! 
 For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for activity for December 22-26, 2000.  The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.  Specificially the following trades were transacted over the telephone:  Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor   The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most companies observed the company holiday on December 26th.  As a result, volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.

 sounds perfect, -- do you need cash or is a check okay? 
 Hi Monique,  We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.  Natasha and I attend the same church and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same place.  What a coincidence!  To top it all off, I received an e-mail from Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to send her an e-mail".  Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.  I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, and a black liquid eyeliner.  Please let me know if you have these items in stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!  Thank you so much.  Patrice X35772 
 You go girl, you're in my prayers! 
 Hi Dan  This memo shall confirm our agreement to deliver 3,000 MMBtu's per day to National Steel for the above referenced time period.  Deliveries will be at the NGPL Nipsco City Gate.  Call if you have further questions.  Thanks 
 Oh Hope,  So nice to hear from you!  I think about you all the time.  I miss not seeing you every Tuesday!  Are you considering coming back any time soon?  If not, I certainly understand, we are so "messy".  We just finished "Take it to the Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year. We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day. A big improvement over last year, although they wanted us there at 11:00 that morning.  I just bought a new truck for me and the kids, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe. I really like it, but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that big, and it sits so high, whoa!!  I certainly am praying, just as you are, that the kids are doing great and everything is going great for you.   We'll have to get together and do a "afternoon at the park" with the kids.  Take care.  Love ya!  P.S. Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll e-mail more often! 
 Call id you have any discrepancies.  Thanks 
 Yes, I'll see you there!
