ss you 
 are you coming to the front porch 
 whatever, I understand your embarrasment in getting caught 
 would you stop lying about the guy, Im not going to hold it against you for staring 
 just you baby 
 whatever 
 you too 
 I already did in the previous e mails 
 I think we both know the real truth 
 you dont have to be nasty 
 the first step to recovery is admitting it 
 just admit it 
 ok a crush 
 dont worry it is probably just an infatuation that will pass 
 I know 
 whatever, ok if thats what you want me to believe 
 stop lying, you dont have to be embarrased, I understand 
 I wasnt accusing you I was just stating a fact 
 no I dont know how it works, and who t
