le to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November.  Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.   Thanks, Monika Causholli ext. 5-1510 
 Maybe I should rephrase it: What I was trying to say there was that producers are going to continue to make efforts to increase the prices in November in line with what they have announced. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.  thanks for the feedback though. It helps a lot. Monika

 Dave,  As PPPC explains in the attached file the reason for the low levels of inventory was because the consumer inventories had reached such a low level (below normal) throughout the whole year that now consumers are rebuilding the stocks.  Monika

 Hello Jim,  I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon. That's great news!  Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security. My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those.  It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.  If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any contact in the job market I would look into that too.  Thanks Jim, Monika 
 Karen,  Here is my resume.  Thanks, Monika 
 Jim,  This is very helpful. I already forwarded my resume to the Tektronix contact you told me. I am forwarding you a copy of my resume as well just in case you something good crosses your way. I appreciate your help a lot. This whole thing with my company happened so fast and caught me off guard.- a lesson for next time-.  Anyways please continue to keep in touch. I will do the same and keep you posted. You know we really do not want to go back home right now. I have a list of things I haven't accomplished yet.  Thanks, Monika 
 Forgot to attach it. Here is my resume. 
 Sorry Morela. I will remove you now from the list. Monika

 Hello Mr. Hughson,  Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program. I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the PhD finance program at the University of Colorado. Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and the deadlines?  I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have two years of work experience.  Sincerely, Monika Causholli Enron Corp. (713) 345 1510 
 Jim,  I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am waiting for his response. In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday. Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with? Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.  Monika 
 Hey Ami,  Here is my resume.   Thanks, Monika 
 Jim,  I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal. There will be a total of four school
