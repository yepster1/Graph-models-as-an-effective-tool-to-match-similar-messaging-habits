 Kay ,  No go on the laon for both the current lot and the new house , I told my dad to drop the price to 198,500 this would pay off the debt and get that taken care of but no profit At this point we need to talk about the money that we would loose if we go forward but do not sell the lot it should be the cost of the upgrades at this point lets talk later , i know this is what you were worried about so i want to talk with you before going forward  Love  dq  PS I really enjoyed you this weekend
