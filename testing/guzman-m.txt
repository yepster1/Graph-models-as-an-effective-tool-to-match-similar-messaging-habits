Memo to Jones:  You HAVE to come up with some better excuses if you don't want to get hazed.  The Opera!  REALLY GUY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!? 
 Hey, sorry I didn't write you back sooner however I had a six day break. Anyway,  ST Pattys day was a blast, Dahl and Pat and I started drinking around 10am and by the time the night was over we had been to 10 different bars, (got kicked out of two)  met up with a ton of people and had an overall blast.  I was so hating it the next day.   My sister was up from LA this weekend.  We had a really good time.  Went to Touche and the Gypsy on Thursday, went to the Blazer game and then Scooters.  On Saturday night we went to the Kennedy School, and on Sunday we went to Multnomah Falls and took her to Beaches for lunch.  She had a really good time and it was nice to have her up for the weekend.  Anyway, how is everything with you? 
 Hey kiddo.  I didn't get in until last night.  My weekend went allright. Most of it was filled with family stuff.  Saturday night I just hung out with my dad and watched the beavs game on tv.  I did go out to Hollywood with some friends on Sunday night however. It was a friend of mines birthday so we went over to his house and then to this club in Hollywood.  It  was  a good time however, pretty mellow.  I went with my friends Chrissy and Allison and they both had to work on Monday so we left at around midnight.  It was okay with me however, as I really wasnt that into partying anyway. Oh yeah, I got that job.  I think I start tommorow night which means I will be working this weekend which really sucks as there is a beavs game, but I am really looking forward to this new position.  How did your weekend go?  Any exciting stories? 
 John, I am going to be in Los Angeles on Monday and Tuesday to attend to a family matter.  If you make a decision on the position during that time please feel free to give me a call on my cell 702-0463 
 I am leaving now.  I will see you at my house at 12. Thank you so much! 
 Hey dude,  thought you would enjoy this picture.  Go Beavs! 
 You are a superstar! 
 hey can you pick me up at my house instead of work.  I would rather not leave my car at work all weekend. 
 Well, have a great weekend and I will give you a call when I get back! 
 Sounds like a blast.  My work thing was fun.  I broke my sobreity and got really drunk, went home and passed out at 8pm.  I was totally loaded.  It was very fun though. My interviews went awesome yesterday.  I think I will get that job.   So what do you have planned for the weekend?  Anything exciting? 
 So how was your little "Friends" party last night?  Did you guys have punch and cookies? 
 the problem is that I need to go at noon. 
 I am in.  Do we have a volleyball game that night?  If so what time? 
 I would like to thank all of you for the opportunity to discuss the Real Time position with me today.  I am very excited about the opportuniy and I am looking forward to becoming a valuable asset to Real Time and Enron as a whole. I am confident the position would be an excellent fit.   If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me.  I am looking forward to your positive response.  Thanks again  Mark A Guzman 
 I am going to be in LA until Tuesday night so unfortunately i will be unable to attend. 
 Sorry that i didn't respond I was in interviews for the past several hours. I am super busy right now but i will give you a call when I get back and we can hang out.  Have a great weekend!  Don't get in to much trouble 
 So, I gave those keys to Kim and told her your story.  She was very greatful.  Thanks for the idea. I probably would have bungeled a story that I made up. 
 Yeah, I can help you out as long as it is not to late in the evening.  Let me know what your schedule is.  Do we need to use my car or do you have a truck? 
 my week six pick is cincinatti bengals.  Thanks 
 FYI.  I will be out of the office on Monday October 9th. I can be reached on my cell phone if neccesary.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Sorry Heather, I will be unable to attend.  I am bummed as I really wanted to go however, I will be in LA this weekend.  Are you going to Paddy's tommorow night? 
 Nicely done Kim!  Remind me to buy you a beer for that one on Mike! 
 Well, I don't really know what to tell you.  I don't know Dave and all I really know is what you have told me which is that he has a bad temper and appears to have an alcohol problem.  I am sure he must be a good guy if you have been dating him this long though. Speaking of alcohol I have kind of come to a realization recently that I need to cut down on my own drinking. That is part of the reason i didn't drink this weekend. I am not going to stop going out for a few beers but, I am just tired of how I feel the next day and just laying around and shit.  And the thing with my dad has really scared me into being more  healthy.  Although it doesn't seem to really show to much i have been going to the gym 5-6 days a week and I just don't want to be my Dads age and be looking at the kind of health problems that he is havning right now.  I think for you the best thing to do right now is to figure out whether you think you have a big enough future with Dave to go through with trying to help him with the problem. If you think you do and the drinking thing is an issue to you then you need to bring it up again when he is sober but  if you don't think so then maybe you should consider walking away.   Good luck and if you need someone to talk to or advice you can always count on me. 
 Thats cool dude.  Sorry we missed you too.  We had a fun time on Saturday night.  Friday i took my sister to the blazer game.  She had a really good time.  Anyway, I have a 200 level seat behind the basket for game three of the playoffs do you want to go?  It is a $76 ticket.  I may be able to get game 4 (if neccesary) also if you are interested.  Let me know. It should be either the 25th or 26th. 
 Is his drinking problem that bad or are his friends over reacting?  Not to pile on or anything but yeah that was a bad idea bringing it up when he was drinking. 
 Well, sorry to hear your weekend sucked so bad.  Mine was pretty awesome.  I was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since Burns was in town I just didn't drink.  On Friday night a bunch of us met up with Burns at Silver Dollar Pizza.  We hung out there for a while and then went to the Gypsy.  I came home rather early since I wasn't drinking and didn't want to stay in the smokey Gypsy when i was sick.  Then on Saturday Valarie, Boyd and I drove down to the Beavers game. We had the best time.  We went to the peacock first and the  tailgated before the game.  Burnsy, Sul, Shef, Chris and Jimmy were so retarded by gametime.  I felt like a big babysitter being the only sober one.  The game was awesome and everyone but me valarie and boyd stayed down in Corvallis.  Sunday I was still feeling sick but went to breakfast and shopping with Cheryl and then we justed vegged at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies.  For being sick and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend I remarkebly had a great time.  I still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday becuase I started having some bad asthma.  T  Everything else is going okay I guess.  I have my final interview for that position I want on Thursday and then on Friday I leave for LA .  So anyway, hope your week is going a little better than your weekend went. Doesn't sound like you had much fun.  Were you and Dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else? 
 Hey.  Just thought I would drop you a line and see how your weekend was? 
 Carla, this doesn't make much sense to me that we would both randomly add a sunday to block forward deals.  I looked both of them up and it appears that they were both index forward transactions and both were entered on the smae day.  Therefore it would appear that there may have been a problem with the masks? 
 This week I am picking San Diego to lose to the Rams. 
 uh.. how do I get a hold of you these days? 
 It is jfbosu@yahoo.com  What are you doing this weekend.  Are you going to the U of O vs UW game? That should be a really good game.  Did I tell you I saw Carter last weekend? 
 Do you want me to have him call you even if I don't go out with them? 
 I don't even know Dave so I wouldn't judge him.  I just worry about you being with someone that has a bad temper like that.  You know eventually that temper might be aimed at you.  I know you can take care of yourself and I am sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't mean I can't worry about ya.  :)   So I didn't go anywhere last night.  I am feeling pretty sick and Burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in until about 12 last night.  I haven't talked to him yet today and last time I talked to him i told him I had plans tonight which have been changed.  I would like to go out with him but I don't really feel like drinking and I am really trying to cut back on it.  This thing with my dad has really scared me about drinking and bieng more healthy.  I am not pretending that I am going to stop drinking I just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on it.  There is no need for me to get as drunk as I did last weekend.  Boy is that a great story! If I do go out with Burns tonight should I call you? 
 Probably not, my sister is in town. 
 didnt you get this email? 
 what are you talking about? 
 Actually that doesnt sound very funny to me.  I mean what the fuck did he do that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared seeing him act like that.  Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show that kind of temper around you.  Anyway its really none of my business i guess.  I appreciate the sentiment about my family and I will mention it to my mother.  I hope you feel better. 
 OH MY GOD!  I WAS WITH SOME GIRL!?!?!???! WHAT A DICK I AM TO GET OVER YOU SO FAST!" That is pretty funny.   You know what is funny about that is that I was pretty sure she would call and tell you that.  What a dork! You know what, I am starting to get sick too and it sucks because Burnsy is coming into town this weekend.   Anyway hopefully I will get better. Well, my good streak came to an end after a whopping one week when I found out that my grandma is in a comma and will only live another day or two and my dad is in the hospital again with a blod clot in his heart and will be there a week and maybe longer..  It is really hard to be sitting up here and not be with my family right now but I think and hope they understand. And I will be going down there next weekend to visit and apparently for my grandmothers funeral.  My mom is not doing well at all and I really wish I could be there for her.  She doesn't deal with loss very well. On a positive note it looks like i will probably start trading real time energy in the next few weeks. I am moving to that department and I am sooooo excited about it.  The only thing that sucks is that it is a lot like fire fighter hours in that you have to work night shifts.  It works three days on then three days off, three nights on three days off and then once a month you get six days in a row off.  So in a month you get a ton more days off but, you have to work some nights and some weekends which sucks.  That part will be sweet but I am not too excited about working the 6pm to 6am shift.  But it also entails a raise of $4500 due to the hours so all in all it should be a positive move.  Anyway how is everything with you? 
 I am probably not going to make it.  A) I am feeling sick.  B) Burns is in town and if I am feeling better
