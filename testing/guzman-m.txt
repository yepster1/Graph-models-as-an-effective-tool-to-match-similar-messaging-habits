on her about how everytime I hang out with any chicks she gets pissed and it is none of her fucking business what I do.  She said she was mad because I hung out with chicks in Vegas with Jay.  The stupid thing is that Jay didn't even dance with any chicks or anything.  He was on way good behavior.  I completely melted down on her and I told her she needed to go get counseling. The love life is off and on right now. I have been seeing Nicole when I go down to LA however, I think between all the shit her and I get from Jay, my sister, and Chrissy, it really isnt worth the hassle and has kind of made it a little uncomfortable.  I did meet that Alisha girl and hooked up with her a little this weekend.  She is really cool and she is totally someone I would date, if I lived in LA.  We really clicked.  I am going down there next weekend so maybe I will hang out with her instead of Nicole.  I don't know. The Nicole thing with my sister and Jay and Chrissy really pissed me off bad. As far as girls up here my love life is pretty non existant.  There is this girl from work that I really like and we hang out a lot but nothing much has really happened yet.  I am really never here very much anymore.  Anytime I have breaks from work I have been going to LA.  I have been sending some resumes around down there and I am pretty seriously considering moving back. I am just kind of bored with Portland and there really isn't a lot for me here.  You never really talked about whats going on with you these days? 
 hey you.! yeah, sorry about the late night call.  Jay, TJ, Scott, Chrissy, and Nicole and I were out pretty late that night and then came back to my house for a hot tub. We got really drunk becuase earlier in the night Scott got his Porsche impounded for basically no reason and we were bummed becasue we were on our way to this really cool club.  Well anyway, Jay was asking me how you were doing and I was drunk so I gave you a call.  Vegas was absolutely out of control!  We all decided on the way home that it was by far the craziest Vegas weekend any of us had ever been on.  It ended up being me, Jay, TJ, and Brendan.  Jimmy and Kato didn't come.  Anyway, TJ's girlfriend Jessica and some of her friends came out on Saturday.  We all went out to a nice dinner then gambled for a while and then went to some dance club where we proceeded to get in two fights because some dudes were hitting on Jessica.  We got kicked out of the club at the Luxor.   TJ got hit pretty bad and ended up with a black eye, Jay got his tooth chiped and I got sucker punched on the side of my head by some guy that was smaller than Jay.  And that was the mellow part of the evening.! It got even crazier after that as TJ, Jessica , Alisha, and I ended up staying up until 6am.  Then we went and hung out in their room at the Luxor for a couple hours. then went back downstairs and started partying again!  Meanwhile we couldn't find Jay and Brendan anywhere and we were really worried that they might be in Jail. Finally they called us at around 8am from some strip club. Anyway,  I have a ton more stories but this mail is getting too long.  How has everything been with you? Fill me in.  Oh,  I was going to buy a new TV anyway, so I was thinking why, don't we just trade our TV's back and you can use the $$$ to buy yourself a VCR or something. 
 Chris, you can count me in however, with my wierd work hours I am sure there will be games that i wont be able to make.  But  count me in and let me know when you need the money.

 Hey Katie, I am just getting off work here in a few minutes and thought i would drop you a line.  I am doing good.  I am sorry I missed your call on Saturday night.  I was at home and in bed by 9:30.  I went out until 3 am on Friday night and then Rick and I went skiing on Saturday morning and left at 6:30 am.   We were skiing until 7pm up at Meadows so by the time I got home I just went straight to bed I was soooo exhausted.  Skiing was awesome however, and I did really well as I went and had my skis tuned.  What a difference that made.  While I was waiting for them to be tuned I ended up buying new skis, boots and poles.  I can't wait to try them out!  Anyway, things are going good for me.  I am a little depressed however as today is my Dads birthday. Also Cita is back in the hospital again.  She had another heart failure.  She is doing better though.   I am leaving tommorow morning to spend the rest of the week with my sister/visit Cita and then I am going to Vegas on Saturday with Jay, Jimmy, Caitlin, Nicole and a few other people.  I am excited to go and in a way it is kind of a deal for my dad as he loved to go to Vegas for his birthday and the Super bowl weekend.  Anyway, I better run.  I work tonight so email me back so I have something to read for the night shift.  How is everything with you? 
 I have set up the following BPA account numbers since we have been submitting dec bids at Malin the past few days:  CISO to PUGET  882716 CISO to WWP       681713 CISO to SCL         882790 CISO to Tacoma 882791  I realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however, I thought it would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or unwilling to pick up at Malin. Also I have added an account number for Turlock to SCL.  SCL has been willing to do Buy/Resales from their system to Malin recently and this should be useful given that Snohomish has recently been unwilling to do so.  TURLOCK to SCL  790612  These numbers have all been added to the RT BPA Account #'s spreadsheet in P:/realtime.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Jesse, this has been done.  I called APS to confirm that they show this however they said they were to busy and they would call me back.  As of this email they have not yet called me back.  They seemed a  little perturbed that I was calling about 1 MW. 
 Hey Dave.  Hope your weekend went well with the girls.  I got a call from my mom tonight that Cita was in the Hospital again.  According to my mom she is doing okay now.  I called Cita on Friday and she said she just felt like she was getting a cold but apparently she went in for the heart failure thing again?  Is that correct.?  Anyway,  I am working the night shift tonight so I will give her a call tommorow afternoon after I wake up.   I called and left you a message letting you know that i am probably not going to Vegas. Everyone kind of flaked out.  So, I will be around the weekend of the Super Bowl and was wondering what you guys might be doing for it.  Also I was going to see if you and Karen would maybe be interested in going up to Big Bear to go skiing for the day on Friday or Saturday.  I thought it might be fun.  I have an extra set of ski's that I was thinking about bringing and leaving down there anyway so I could go without having to hassle with Rentals.  So, let me know if you have any interest in doing that and if you have anything going for the Super Bowl.  Tell Cita I love her and tell Bob to get in shape!  See ya soon! 
 Tate, go to the tab on this spredsheet for 1/22 and print.  Give me a call afterward. 
 Hey there Kim! Sorry this response is so late!  I read your email on a night when I was really busy and then just kind of spaced out in replying back.  So I got your pictures and the card.  Thanks a bunch!  My Christmas went pretty well and I actually got to go out on New years eve as my schedule changed at the last minute.  I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was pretty cool.  I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these girls that I met there until about 5 am.  I talked to Burns a few days ago and I guess he is still seeing that chick.  I didn't ask about the living situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down there.  So anyway how was your New Year.?  How did everything go with Ricky? I would be stoked if you came up for a long weekend or something!  Anyway I gotta run.  Talk to you later! 
 No i guess not I was just giving you some shit and you didn't respond. Usually you respond when I give you shit 
 Herro? 
 So, how are you feeling today?  It was ROUGH waking up at 5am this morning! 
 can i read this at work dude? 
 REAALLY?? I see how it is.  Smell a free dinner and all of a sudden ya wanna hang out
