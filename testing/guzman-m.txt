Could one of you please take care of this matter tonight.  thank you for your assistance. 
 Les, we were unable to find power at a reasonable rate for the  HE 5 2MW schedule so we therefore we just didn't show up in the PX for that hour.  The only offer we recieved was for $225 which I felt was too steep to pay.  It turned out well however as the PX price was $120 and there was no cong at Mead so we saved them a little money by not buying the $225.  Just thought I would let you know. 
 Hey Tyson.  Are you guys doing anything after the game?  I think Ben Pacewic, Jeff Burns, Kevin Stangeland, Chris Hartman, Rueben Schug and some other guys are coming down and staying the night but i don't think we will have time to stop by before the game.  I know I would like to come by the house and see how things are doing and I am sure those guys would to so let me know if you guys have anything going on Saturday night.  YITB  GUZ 
 So I went out with a bunch of dudes from work last night.  Me and my buddy Bill met these two chicks at the Saucebox and one of them asked for my number.  So I pick up my cell phone this morning and theres a message.  The chick called me last night!  The night I freaking met her.  HELLO PSYCHO! 
 Whats up Lester.  Are you going to go to the Bowl game.  It looks right now like it might be the fiesta or the Holliday Bowl.  If it is the Holliday Bowl i will probably go however if it is the Fiesta bowl I wont be able to make it.  How is the family.  Are you guys planning on coming out anytime soon 
 Dont worry about it.  I had a good time.  I don't really know what our plan is for the Beaver Game as I am hanging out with Burns and some guys from my fraternity and hadn't really planned on hanging out with those guys until after the game.  But you can give me a call on my cell phone that day and I can let you know where the Winnebago is and maybe you guys can come meet us or if not we can meet up after the game or something. 
 So do I get a raincheck on Beaches? 
 I will be in LA folio.  Sorry 
 Thanks for being so nice about me venting.  I actually tried to call you but you were porbably in bed.  So I just went to the store grabbed as six pack had a few beers and sat at my computer for until about 3 am.  I was really having an enmotional night last night.  I think I just hadn't let go of my feelings and it all just came out in one night.  It is funny but the next morning I got calls from both Price Strader and Kim Kirkwood to see how I was doing.  Did I ever tell you the story about Kim and I at Wilsons wedding?    If not I should tell you it is really funny.  Anyway as far as watching the game I would love to watch it with you but I have tickets. Benny,  Burns, and a bunch of us are taking Benny's Winnebago down there and partying.  What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be going down there on no sleep.  Regarding Beaches, I would love to do that also but, I am leaving on Sunday for LA and won't be back until the day after thanksgiving.  So, i guess i will just give you a call or something when I get back.  I thought that you would be watching the game with Dave.  Did something happen and you guys get in a fight again or something? 
 That was the absolutely one of the stupidest jokes I have ever heard.  Maybe you guys should put down your bongs for a minute and try to come up with something a little better than that.  GO BEAVS! 
 Wait do we pay her or just charge it online? 
 I would definetly be interested.  Tell her I will have the money for her on Sunday 
 Harbor Cogen called this on Monday night shift at approximately HE 24 stating that they would be unable to supply their day ahead schedules due to a crack in an oil supply line.  Mike at Harbor stated that we should not bid in day ahead schedules for Wednesday either as it appears to be a problem which may take some time to fix.  To cover the day ahead schedules we looked for power to cover it in SP however we could not find even an offer during the night shift.  I would advise Les and whomever is on the day and night shifts on Tuesday to keep in touch with Harbor regarding this issue.  Thank you for your attention to this matter and if you should have any questions please call me on my cell 702-0463 
 Hey dave.  I have a night shift tonight so thats why I am not getting back to  you until now.   Regarding Thanksgiving I have the 18th through the 23rd off. It is one of those six day breaks i was telling you about.  So this saturday (18th) I am going to the Civil War (Uof O vs. OSU) footbal game.  I am way fired up about it.  It should be a great time.  Then on Sunday afternoon I will be flying in to Orange County at 3:30pm and will be down there through Thursday evening when I will be flying back home at 6:30. Unfortunately I have to work the Friday after thanksgiving but at least I will be able to spend thanksgiving day  and most of the week with all of you.  I am going to be staying at my mothers house for the week.  Maybe Sunday evening we can all have dinn
