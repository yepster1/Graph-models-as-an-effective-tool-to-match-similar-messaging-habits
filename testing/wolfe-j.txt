 I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am excited about these posters, but I have a couple questions.

 Mr. Boehlke:  After speaking to a NW Natural representative, I was told to contact you for more specifics regarding information on your customer breakdown. I am interested in gas load by residential, industrial, and electrical generation on a weekly or monthly basis. Your financial statements have a quarterly cross-section in a fairly similar format, but I was hoping I could get more specific numbers, including the type of industrial user (high-tech, aluminum, agricultural, etc.) and historicals back to last winter. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it, as trying to foreca
