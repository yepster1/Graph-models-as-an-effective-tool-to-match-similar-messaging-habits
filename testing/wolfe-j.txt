or Houston the 26th. Let Sweetpea know. Jason 
 I open my email, and Trav is inviting people over, threatening to pull out the ol' lance, and comparing dimensions with Matty. I guess that means it's game night. Is Allan going to around Tues? He has been notoriously absent, and may not be allowed to play anymore. 
 oh, and the pause for "Friends" was a nice touch. I think that reveals the true, inner warlike nature of MillerKnight. You go, girlfriend! 
 Thurs I can play after Thirtysomething...  but on a serious note, I need some clarification on when AoE lance night is taking place, and when XBox night (Thurs?) is happening. I'll bring some Miller for MK Jason 
 Hey, thanks for trying to squeeze in a few minutes with your friends the weekend you finally fly down to Houston. I wouldn't expect you to make a trip unless you had to. 
 sorry, no 
 I've been working pretty heavily. This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runs for about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of Houston. It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves, swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really into it, and travel a long way to go. Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird? Go online if you haven't, and have the big guy look at it, too. I think it looks pretty awesome, but I'm not sure it will be my next car.  Love, Jason 
 Who is playing, and when should we start? Get back at me so I will know when to show up. Thanks, DJ 
 I hear you are good at facilitating a quick "meating" 
 Jonda, be a sport. No one expected YOU to get a T-shirt. You and Beth were getting tube tops.   So was Matt. 
 will you be holding his leash and cleaning up his mess? 
 so are you saying we SHOULD go away over Thanksgiving? 
 you're my angel XOXOXOXOXO 
 Am I the only one sharpening my lance for some AoE this week, or is that SO pre-XBox?  PS: Look at ENE -- the end of an empire
