 HI, i'm scheduled to arrive at 1:25 PM on Nov 30, flight 1287.  Looking forward to it!  Eric 
 Here's the load mix for Southern and TVA, for the region and top 5, in case you haven't gotten that far yet.  Don't understand why TVA (the utility) has no res/com load, but that's what PowerDat had.  Enjoy.  E 
 Sorry, Continental. 
 Listen, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.  That was not my intention.  I still care about you.  How could I not?  We were together for so long.  I'm just uncertain right now, about what type of relationship I would like to have with you.  I don't know.  Ok, thanks for listening.  Eric 
 Just like any other day, right?  Heh, heh. 
 Hey Dude, =20 Yeah the compnay is toast.  The story gets stranger every day.  Half of the= Houston office was laid off early December.  More to come I am sure.  My g= roup was purchased by UBS Warburg.  I am fortunate that they offered me a j= ob.  A bunch of guys in my group were not.  I feel lucky, things could be m= uch worse for me, but instead I have an opportunity to be part of a pretty = impressive organization.  Work has a actually been a little strange, since = the company had declared bankruptcy we litterally have nothing to do.  Sinc= e the first week of Dec, I've been going to work for maybe a couple hours a= day, just hanging out, talking to the other guys, surfin the net.  It give= s me the chance to take care of all the errand type stuff I normally don't = have a chance to.  I've been cooking a lot, taking care of my backyard, sel= lin shit on ebay, stuff like that.  Some of the other traders have been rea= ding trading books and stuff, but you know me...  By the way my permanent h= ome email is now esaibi@houston.rr.com <mailto:esaibi@houston.rr.com>. =20 I got your card that you sent to Adnan.  Thanks.  I'm not sure if I told yo= u, but I bought a house here a few months back.  When my Dad was planning t= o move here I thought it would be better to buy a place instead of renting = a big apt.  It's brand new, location is pretty good in that it is near a lo= t of things.  Although the area right around here is a bit sketchy.  I figu= re it'll probably get better over time.  I hope things are going well for y= ou.  When will you visit the U.S?  If you ever visit LA let me know.  I cou= ld always meet you there if you give me enough notice.  As you can imagine,= airline tickets are pretty cheap these days. =20 Can you believe Khan is married?  It was kinda strange cuz I was pretty muc= h the only one of his friends involved in the wedding.  His brother and fam= ily were able to show up for the ceremony at least.  That was good.  It was= a bit difficult because my Dad passed away the morning of his wedding, but= I knew I couldn't leave him then.  Khan has some pictures if he hasn't sho= wn you any yet.  He sent me a couple.  Well I gotta go to bed soon.  I'll d= o a better job keeping in touch.  It's just been a little difficult lately,= I'm sure you understand.  Don't work too hard. =20 Eric =20 6031 North Arrowana Lane Houston, TX  77036 USA =20 Check out these links re: my ebay success.  I got some heat about the chron= article.  They generally frown upon talking to the press at work.  This st= uff actually has been selling far above what the articles say, insane! =20 <http://news.com.com/2100-1017-816781.html?legacy=3Dcnet&tag=3Dmn_hd> =20 <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/business/1215116> =20 =20 
 Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of "Financial Portfolio Managment" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you knew anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks buddy.
