 wanted.  Thanks, Mike 
 We need to talk about the contract language for Holly Sugar.  Please see Kim Ward about some of the language we have used for full-req customers on PG&E.  Thanks, Mike 
 Please call me.  I believe I ordered a bloomberg machine only.  Does it some with its own operating system or is it offered through the network?  Please let me know before coming to install.  I already have two computers.  Thanks, Mike 
 We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.  Mike 
 Anne,  Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations? I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association with Socal curves.  Let me know.  Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?  It would be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.  Mike 
 We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in sitara.  I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to book this deal properly.  I need the transport booked in sitara at index to index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been fixed.  Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the cost from April?  Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside Ferc?   Thanks,  Mike 
 Jay, what are we doing with questar positions?  Are you managing this index point? I have an April position and Mark Whitt is working on a term deal.  Thanks, Mike 
 Please write up a ticket transferring my CIG and WIC April physical positions to IM denver.  I will be selling CIG index to Jay at CIG index flat and buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.  Also, run a report of all my term index positions at CIG and WIC for the summer, so that we can transfer these to Jay as well.  Thanks, Mike 
 The Rockies index language looks good.  We need to separate the southern border PG&E trades from the southern border socal and Socal trades.  All Socal trades (except KRS, which we have none at this time) go under Socal and southern border - socal wacogs, while the PG&E topock/southern border - PG&E trades go under the Southern border, PG&E wacog.  Please make the change to the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing.  Thanks, Mike 
 The information is correct.  Please settle with the customer.  Thanks, Mike 
 Anne,  We will need to add a message to the email that we send out to the publications this bidweek.  Let's get together to discuss the text.  We have added new products that will need to be matched with their respective Index postings.  Thanks, Mike 
 Ken called yesterday and we bought 5000/d april from him at 4.87.  He said it could be either Milagro or El Paso SJ.  Please call him and confirm the receipt point.  Thanks, Mike 
 Anne, can you look at this deal and check to see how it was priced? 
 Frank Ermis claims that this deal was priced at Index.  He was the Trader on this deal.  Please call him to discuss.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby 
 I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.  Please run a new P&L early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will be.  I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves before we decide to book these tomorrow.   Please run a report from the transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.  Thanks, Mike 
 Please review the transport positions in sitara for next month.  We should have the Baja transport included.  100,000 short for PG&E topock, 80,000 long Citygate, and 20,000 long KRS.  The sj to socal transport should be broken out to like 24,000 topock, 14,000 mojave, and the balance to pg&e topock. Also, please check on the kingsgate to malin and stanfield to malin for next month.  What about sj to waha?  Patti, please run a report showing all of the sitara transport deals.  Thank you!  Mike 
 Phillip,  Courtney needs me to watch the boys on Thursday in order to get organized before we leave for Italy.  I can be reached on my cell phone 713-408-6256. Please have Anne update the newcurrentday sheet in order to manage my position.  Please call me with any pertinent market information.  I will see you Friday.  Thanks for the help.  Thanks, Mike 
 Can we scrub the transport model P&L for yesterday?  Did the transport being switched to PG&E topock show any losses?  Let me know the breakdown.  Thanks, Mike 
 Is the Baja for April transport in sitara?  Please let me know.  Thanks, MIke 
 Please activate all index producst in section 1125.  Non Texas phys index less than one year.  PG&E, SOCAL, and Socal Ehrenberg.  Thanks, Mike 
 Melba,  Will you please take a look at the term non-texas index products greater than one year and activate them?  The section is numbered (1126) in product manager.  Thanks, Mike 
 Steve,  Let's discuss all of your new rox products for EOL.  I would like to know which products to roll out on EOL for April bidweek.  I would also like to discuss creating a south of Muddy Creek product for Kern gas.  I would assume that it would fall under the IF Kern index.  Thanks, Mike 
 We have created the new southern border index products for Socal and PG&E topock.  Please create your new basis and gas daily products for these indices as soon as possible.   Mattt will need to create the gd index products as well.  Let the brokers know about the new indices  I have the back office setting up new curves to book these deals.  You will have two curves for Socal now.  The curves will show your risk on the old index, as well as the new index.  The new Socal index is the same as the old except that excludes KRS.  I will be taking these phys products out on EOL as soon as possible.  Thanks, Mike 
 Frank,  The new procedures for trading basis are working well.  We still need to get the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am pleased with the new procedure.    I need to work on staying out of the basis market entirely going forward. Can you also try to work all basis at Socal through Keith.  Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the future.  I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.  I will let him know in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.  Thanks, Mike 
 The index products look great.  Can you have the same constraint language included on the PG&E Topock location for creating the phys forward (fixed price) product?  Let me know when that is done.  Thank you.  Mike 
 Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.  He needs to work on the TW sheet as well.   Also, I would like him to create a sheet on pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the desk to use.  Mike 
 Mark,  Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport this gas.  How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this point?  If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.  A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be nice.  Thanks,  Mike 
 I sent an email to Phillip as well.  We will find out. 
 Please check the gd swap cheyenne positions for March.  I am confident that I have cheyenne short positions on this month, but they are not showing up in the intraday tab.  Please check to see if they are booked as kern/opal by mistake.  Thank you.  Mike 
 Melba,  Thank you for your assistance.  These look good.  Mike 
 You guys have no chance of building a strong presence here at Enron.  Susan and I will make sure of it.  Stick to the Galant Night and Blancos. 
 Melba,  Please set up the Souther border, PG&E and Southern Border, Socal inices in the database.  We have new risk coming in April that needs to find a market soon on EOL.   We can have NGI send you the new index posting if you need it.  Also, please acitvate long term index products of one year.  There is also a PG&E topock phys product in the one month category for april that needs to be activated.  I look forward to hearing from you Monday morning.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby 
 Pablo,  Will you stop by when you get a chance to do the following:  1. set up network connection to laptop 2. download passport and gasselect on desktop and laptop 3. level the monitors  Thanks, Mike 
 Dear John,  I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my added responsibilities.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby 
 Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days gen numbers and load forecasts.  Including pricing info and heat rates from the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.  Effective on Thursday.  Thanks, Mike 
 Let's have Matt start on the following:  Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets database created should help him forecast core demand.  Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and TW pipelines.  Mike 
 Our associates on the desk have asked why they have been included in the associate evaluation.  Are they in the corporate associate pool or are they simply designated associates on the trading floor?  No big deal - just forwarding their comments.  Mike 
 Thank you.  Will you please show me the detail from yesterday's difference and today's difference?  Mike 
 I would like to take a quiet stroll with you in a dark alley.  Grigsby 
 Yours.  I hate golf. Thanks for thinking of me.  Grigsby 
 We ar so proud of you.  Mike 
 Anne, on the last day of the month we need to send in the index before noon.  Gracias 
 Please let me know when our new socal and pg&e index descriptions are available. Also, please activate the phys  index producst in draft - one year terms 02-04.  Thanks, Mike x37031 
 Let's set up the new indices on Tues.  PG&E topock and Socal border.  Matt and Frank will set up new products for gd swaps and basis.  I am working on the phys index.   Keith will change the socal index from Southern CA border average to Southern  border, Socal.  This new index excludes KRS.  Grigs 
 Will you please set up the 100% flow SJ product?  I would like the title to be just like the current EP product -  no mention of 100% flow on the title. I would like to avoid making this a separate index posting.  Let's make this available to the entire market.  Thanks, Mike 
 What is this for? 
 Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.  I would like to discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the market.  Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, storage, operations personnel, etc.  I realize that this will be risky and that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think we should press forward.  Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas? Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, etc?  Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?  Let's discuss in detail.  Mike 
 Looks great!  gracias 
 I will submit the move request for the west desk on Monday.  We should have Anne fill this spot. I would like her to keep track of New Current day and all new deals that flow through the desk.  She can coordinate tickets to your group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.  She can also put physical deals in Sitara.  Let me know what the desktop PC will need to be loaded with.  Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.  You can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.  Thanks, Mike 
 Please activate long term phys index products in draft.  They are one year index products 02-04.  Thanks, Mike x37031 
 Will you please set up two new indices in the database.  The first one will be NGI Southern Border, Socal.  This is different for the current NGI Socal border index in the system.  Also, please set up NGI Southern Border, PG&E. Let me know when they have been added.  These indices will begin posting in NGI for April, 2001.  Thank you, Mike Grigsby x37031 
 We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.  Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there as soon as possible.  Let me know when they have been changed.  Mike 
 Please remind me of this class.  Thanks. 
 It is my understanding that Susan will be starting her new job on the west desk Monday morning.  We are couting on having her full time beginning the same day.  Let me know if I am incorrect.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby 
 Jeff,  Did you allow me access to all gas reports on Executive reports viewer?  Let me know.  Thanks, Mike Grigsby 
 Ina,  Please have the IT group delete all copies of ICE and Altrade from the west desk.  I think Randy is the only one.  Thanks, Mike 
 Dear Jeff,  I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact business with our customers in the west?  I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of 2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get together and discuss exactly what I may need.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby x37031 
 Good morning.  I am going to unavailable for the interviews on Monday.  The continued Califonia energy crisis and Enron's gas positions will not allow me to leave the desk on Monday.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but my time must be spent in the office.  Please let me know how I may be able to assist the interview process in the future.  I am always willing to help out when I have the time.  Sincerely,  Mike Grigsby 
 Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.  Thanks, mike 
 How do I get the software to operate Socal Gasselect and Passport?  I would like to have them installed on my desktop and laptop.  Thanks, Mike 
 Take a look at my review and let me know if we should any more of your 2000 accomplishments.  I need to get this in your file for HR.  Mike 
 Thank you.  i don't need the value.  I just need the sitara transport report so that I may check the physical positions.  Mike 
 Nice work.  Thanks for the help.  Mike 
 Thank you.  Is there a sitara report that we can run to show the transport in the system through March 2001.  Thank you, Mike 
 Thank you.  We are really excited about the "big Hos"  (Jake's new comment). Coco is busy decorating in her mind.  We will take some pictures this weekend with the digital camera and email them to you.  Mike 
 Ina, will you have the IT group order and install Socal Gasslect and Passport on my desktop and laptop pc?  Thank you, Mike 
 Here are the two addresses to add to the bid week spreadsheet distribution.  kdool@mh.com mhenergy@yahoo.com  Thanks, Mike 
 Please send the resume to myself and Patti Sullivan.  I will look it over and talk to Patti about the positions open in the west.  Thank you for the email.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby  x37031
