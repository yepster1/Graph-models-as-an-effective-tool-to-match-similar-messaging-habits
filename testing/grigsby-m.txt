apacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.  The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  Ehrenberg simply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.  One transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.  This illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg.  Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  Because of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.  These molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the SJ east leg of EPNG.  This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on the EPNG south mainline.  While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does the EOC demand.  Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the EOC demand and the Socal demand.  So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south mainline.  This tells the entire story.  When demand exceeds all available historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may have existed between the supply basins and the market area.  When Keystone West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  There is simply no available capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.  If you asked the market what the maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not know.  This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels.  It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  There simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.  The supply exists, but there isn't enough refining capacity available to meet demand.  Fundamentals rule the market in all cases.  I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern California border.  The market would  be better served with supply being included in these index points.  One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.  The market will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in the future.  We will then address the different interconnects and propose an index for the Socal citygate as well.  Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.  Sincerely,  Mike Grigsby Director of West Trading 713-780-1022 
 Ina,  I need to add my son, Clark Watson, to my beneficiary list for medical, etc. Please let me know what I need to do to complete this task.  Thank you, Mike 
 Tom,  See the email below for the ID and password.  Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any questions.  You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process). Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of setting up a personalized quote page.  Also, call me about where to see our posted daily indices each day on the website.  Enron releases the weighted average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.  Thanks,  Mike 713-853-7031 
 The guest view only password is in the process of being approved.  I apologize for the delay.  I will send you the information as soon as I get it.  Sincerely,  Mike Grigsby 
 Yes.  I would like to see the var and desk positions.  Thank you.  Mike 
 Anne,  I would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in NCD. Please have all of the positions in the BasisTransport tab, section transport model, added to the phys index position totals.  Please look at the PG&E CG positions for May-Oct, I added the transport positions already.  I would like to add a KRS row in the physindex summary to account for the 20000/d transport that we have.  Also, please have the new transport index positions at Socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new KRS column in the physindex tab.  We can review in the afternoon.  You are doing a great job.  I am sorry that I have not had a chance to thank you recently.  The market is distracting me.  Sincerely, Mike 
 I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.  I agree with restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West physical book.  Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am managing all physical positions.  Mike Grigsby 
 Do I not have access to the reports?  Please let me know.  Mike Grigsby x37031 
 Thank you for all of the emails.  The baby is doing great.  Mike 
 Your replies are brief and extremely vague.  I will assume that you are not interested.  Thanks, Mike Grigsby 
 Thanks for the update.  Try to stay flat on all gas dailies tomorrow.  Our length is good for now.  Let's stay flat for now in the oct index. I will be working from home in the morning.  Please have Matt email the ops reports to my lotus.  Also, please have Patti email her sheets also - the pipeline summary and flow reports.  Download the hearme.com software and login on my pc to use the mic, or the headset in one of the drawers on the right.  Tell Philip that I will be using hearme.com.  Mike 
 Steve,  Start buying N-M citygate index this week.  Pay as much as necessary to get resonable size.  I am thinking 100,000/d for the winter.  Grigsby 
 keep buying N-M socal gd index up to plus .04.  I will buy as much as they want to sell.  talk to amerex.  Mike 
 Can you put a tab together for our phys index positions NOV-MAR?  Thanks  Mike 
 Let's continue to buy Socal  for the rest of the month.  I would like to sell Rockies, and remian neutral on Permian and San Juan, unless it looks like the maint on washington ranch will have a bullish effecst on the basins.  I will leave it up to you to determine.  I will call later.  Mike 
 Let's continue to go long sep swing on Socal.  I am willing to as long as we can each day.  The plan of getting short for OCT bidweek no longer applies because of reduced basis risk in OCT basis.  Thanks, Grigsby 
 Please make the return on Sunday earlier.  Before 12:00 would be great.  Thanks, Mike 
 When do we expect to hear back from NGI on the sep index?  Grigsby 
 Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?  What did we decide with this product - swing only?  If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going forward).  I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4, as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.  The NGI index points will be out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.  We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.  Time open to market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc.  This will be considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to participate until their numbers are audited.  Thanks, Mike 
 Please contact Keith Holst if you should have any questions regarding the new spread products.  Please let him know when they are completed.  I will be out of the office until Wednesday.  Thank you very much.  Mike Grigsby 
 I am sure that you are aware of the move to daily basis from monthly.  The west desk will be trying to phase out monthly for daily in the next month. We have created term gd basis vs. the HHub gd through apr-oct 01 for all index points.  Grigsby 
 I created the term gd basis products for waha, perm, sj, opal, and malin this weekend.  Call Dale or Melba to activate.  Keith and I briefly discussed how we would handle the new responsibility.  I am fine with managing the prompt month gd basis, while you guys manage the term.  I will be back in the office this week and we can talk about the products.  Would we handle the monthly the same way?  When do we plan to phase the monthly out?  Have Phillip manage the perm and waha basis until I return.  Dale is also working on the Baja and Redwood on/off system spreads.  We can roll these out for all terms as well.  See you this week.  Grigsby 
 Greg,  Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets not only on EOL, but on other platforms?  I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you for your assistance.  sincerely, Mike Grigsby Director, West Gas Trading x37031 
 Greg,  I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with Enron.  If you don't mind, I would like to have Chase Belew call you to possibly set up a meeting.  I work on the west gas trading desk.  You can reach me at x37031.  Thank you for your assistance.  Sincerely, Mike Grigsby 
 Good morning.  Any news on the spread products for the west?  The titles are Baja and Redwood spreads.  Call me to discuss.  Dale is aware of these.  Thanks, Mike Grigsby x37031 
 I was out yesterday to become a father and Courtney was rescheduled for Monday.  I will call Bruce Garner this morning.  His number is 713-345-7321. I will let you know when the baby finally comes.  Grigsby 
 Please make a few minor changes to the Scal product.  I would like it read GD/D SCal - HHUB.  I apologize about the mistake, but SCAL is a premium to HHUB.  We also need to take a look at the description, fixed and floating.  Thanks, Mike Grigsby 
 Monday at 11:30 would be great.  Thanks, Mike Grigsby x37031 
 I would like to get access to the new westpower website.  Phillip Allen asked me to contact you for access.  I work with Phillip on the west gas desk.  I can be reached at 713-853-7031.  Thank you.  Mike Grigsby 
 Bruce,  I work with P
