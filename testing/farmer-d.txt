om scheduled.)  The volumes that they were trying to make up would go toward the transport imbalance also.  I would think that Cleburne will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.  After Novemeber, the imbalance should be fairly small.  Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have that number.  (When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was very large.   When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices if the opportunity came up.)  The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.  But, I will discuss that with Legal.  The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.  I will be leaving at 1pm today and will return on Tuesday 12/19.  We can get together then if you would like.  D 
 Tonya and I will be there.  D 
 I moved the Cannon sale volumes from #170335 to #529753 effective 12/14/00. You will need to re-nom #529753 for all prior days at zero and then allocate volumes at each meter from the old deal to the new deal.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 I'm cool with it.  D 
 Thu,  I talked with Lee Papyoti about the Equistar buybacks.  I created deal 675086 as an ENA buyback.  However, after you have allocated the volume between the Equistar plants, please get with Lee and have him look over everything.  D 
 Bob,=20  I would like to recommend a promotion for Mike Olsen.  Mike has been instru= mental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one= scheduler with Texas experience.  Mike took on the responsibility that two= people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling). = He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling = processes at the Katy Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity a= t the Katy hub passed through the pipeline.  Mike used his knowledge of the= Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effecti= vely schedule our transactions.  Since June, Mike has handled the logistics= activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasi= s, Guadalupe).  Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he= saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tr= acking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (= on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees t= hrough the hub).  Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relati= onships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we s= cheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  M= ike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his = business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split= my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority o= f my time with the trading.  Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilit= ies.  He acted as lead, supervising and training Jay, our other team member= .  Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  M= ike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, = accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came = to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quic= ker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very m= inimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and process= es to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short= , Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and h= ard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fu= lfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to = close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals. = Mike is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are es= sential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promot= ion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.= =20 Thanks.  Daren 
 Gas Daily Waha is the correct price.  I have changed the deal ticket.  D 
 Thanks!  This is very helpful.  D 
 Brandee,  Don't order any new equipment.  George can use the existing equipment in the space next to me. EB3210F.   D 
 Any deals that were confirmed with Equistar for the first of the month should be kept whole throughout the month.  On days where they didn't pull the nom, the buyback goes into effect.  Any shortages should be allocated to the buyback tickets.  D 
 Julie,  You need to look at any industrial meter that has buyback and swing deals.  Make sure that the base volume is allocated to the base ticket and all other swings go to the other tickets.  D 
 You can extend the deal for one day.  D 
 Tess,  We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.  D 
 Ok, We should be paying Dow based on the index price.  But, it should be IF HSC - .07 instead of -.06.  Sales volumes should be allocated to deal 639612.  D 
 On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  D 
 Julie,  I don't have all the deal numbers.  You will need to run a report out of CPR, or find the deals in MOPS and review the prices in Sitara.  d 
 Suzanne,  Attached is an updated file on our pipeline contract situation.  I haven't gotten much info from credit managers, but I wanted to pass along their names and numbers.  D 
 This should not be a problem.  They can make it up after the outage.  D 
 You need to talk to Gary Lamphier and Lee Papayoti.  D 
 OW,  It looks like you changed the pricing in deal 413462 mentioned below.  Did Gary or Lee ask you to do this?  D 
 Eric,  The Carthage meters to report on EOL are listed below:  Tennessee				4603001 Texas Gas (Firm take away only)	4021021 Koch Midstream				4602001 Koch Gateway				4601003 Lonestar Header				4609001 Reliant					4082006 EPGT Texas Pipeline (PGE Texas)	4615002    There are a couple of meters in the hub, but the capacity is limited.  So, we should not list them.  Let me know if you have any questions or need additional info.  D 
 JW,  Should I roll the flow to Southern Union at Lockhart at HSC GD + .02 for the days listed below?  D 
 You are so enthusiastic. 
 Done. 
 Done. 
 Mike,  I would like for you to move with HPL to the new building to continue training.  I spoke with Ed the other day and let him know this.  Let me know if you have any concerns with this or if you have any questions.  D 
 I've got it covered.  D 
 Contract from Oasis Pipe Line. 
 The price should be 4.955.  I have changed Sitara.  D 
 Tess,  I have changed Sitara to agree with the contract.  This was changed during flash to get around some pricing errors.  D 
 You can send your things to 3210F.  That is Liz's old desk.  D 
 These flows are due to the timing of the meter change.  So, I have adjusted Sitara to cover the 4th and 7th.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 Hey, man!  Well, let me tell you what's' going on.  Every evening and every weekend fo= r the last month and a half, I have been painting and working on the house.= The previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going (pink i= n one room and a portion of the entry way, lime sherbet green in the other = portion of the entry way).  There is a lot of trim, 4 doors, and a 20 ft ce= iling in the living room and entry way.  So it is taking quite a while to c= omplete.  One reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking (di= sposal, toilet flanges, alarm system).  In the middle of trying to finish p= ainting, we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile = (I got the floors ready, we paid to have the tile laid.).  Tonya wants ever= ything done now.  It doesn't bother her that I haven't finished a single pr= oject since we started the whole renovation thing.  But, IT'S KILLING ME!  = I would like just one finished product.  One small room would be fine.  The= house is looking a lot better, though.  I'm trying to not let the work take time away from the kids, so I usually s= tart after 8pm each night.  Plus, when I do work while the kids are running= around I pay a high price.  Last week I was painting the baseboards in the= dining room, with the gallon of white semi-gloss next to me on the floor. = I had earlier used Windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle= in the middle of the floor.  Jake was coming into the room, watching and c= limbing up and down the step ladder (6 ft;  he climbs to the very top like = it's nothing.  Other people come in and see him up there and freak out.  We= just let him go.).  He is big into cleaning (guts it from his mom), so whe= n he saw the Windex he ran and picked it up.  I told him to "take it to Mam= a".  He started out the doorway, but came back in and walked behind me.  I = just kept working, thinking that he was watching me.  Then I noticed out of= the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me.  When I turned to loo= k, I just lost my breath.  Jake had dipped the Windex bottle down into the = paint can, pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet. = White paint was just pouring off the bottle.  It looked like someone had p= oured paint straight out of the can onto the floor.  Thank goodness it was = latex, after about 45 minutes we got it cleaned up.  Cole has helped me wit= h some of the work, such as sanding the walls.  But, he carried his work a = little farther than I wanted.  Yesterday, he had a friend over.  They got h= is tools (play sander/grinder, circular saw, screw drivers), climbed up on = his bunk bed, and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling. = You should have seen the mess.  I am taking a break this weekend though.  Cole and I are going camping at L= ake Livingston.  I am really looking forward to it.  I'm trying to start so= mething with him (and will include Jake when he gets a little bigger)  wher= e we do a guy thing each month.  Last month I took Cole to his first Rocket= s game.  He loved it.  They are getting too big, too fast.  At work, I guess I'm becoming a full fledge trader.  I will be getting my o= wn book in a couple of days.  I'm pretty nervous about that.  There's not a= lot of activity in the training/coaching area around here (hard to believe= , huh?).  But, we'll see how it goes.  The last of the HPL/AEP people are m= oving out of the building tonight.  Everything is on course to close the sa= le on June 1st.  Anyway, I hope you and Linda are doing well.  We'd like to have you over if= we ever get the house in presentable shape.  D 
 Megan,  We did the swap with Pan Energy on 4/28-30 only.  On those days, we received all the gas at Carthage, nothing at Castle Busby.  When we are not operating under the swap, Duke markets the gas that usually comes in at Castle Busby.  Apparently, they sold the gas to Highland in April.  D 
 Rodrig,  There are alot of names on that e-mail.  I hope you spread all those Pina Coladas over the week and not drink them all at once.  Have fun.  D 
 I wish we could have purchased that gas at 4.18.  But, the correct price is 5.18.  I have corrected the deal ticket.  D 
 I have changed the demand fee.  But, is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from Williams?  I don't want to pay Tenaska until we get the money from Williams.  Additionally, I believe that we need to keep the volume at 45,000 for the admin fee, since we originally nominated 45,000/day.  D 
 Mirant had a problem with an EOL transaction where I bought 5,000 from then at $5.10 for the 1st and 2nd.  I agreed to let them out of the deal.  Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.  The two deals should be netted.  We should not have paid the purchase at 5.10.  D 
 Rick,  We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.  1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.  2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.  I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.  Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.  D 
 Take Liz, Gary, and Earl off the list.  Add O'neal Winfee and George Smith.  D 
 Bob,  In looking at the trends over the meters, I made a few adjustments (highlighted in blue).  Please use these changes and enter the deal changes in Sitara.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 Is "not going to AEP" considered an accomplishment?  By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company.  I'm sure they thought that I was superior though.  D 
 The price should be IF Waha.  I have changed the price in Sitara.  D 
 See below.  The deal was priced at Index but entered as GD in Sitara.  This is going to give you a $75,000 hit for April.  D 
 Use deal 399604.  This deal was in Sitara, but did not have the meter attached.  D 
 OW,  On deal 399604 I added meter 3425.  There was no meter originally.  D 
 Done. 
 Sabrae,  See if you can find Danny's deal book and verify the price for the deal listed below.  D 
 Physically...yes.  Mentally...I've been gone a long time.  I'm trying to make a decision whether to stay or go.  How about you?  How are things going?  D 
 The deal has been changed.  D 
 Sandi,  I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.  As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.  Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of Enron North America.  How do we get this corrected?  D 
 Carlos,  Is this the gas on Blue Dolphin?  D 
 Deal 717768 should be kept whole.  This is a baseload purchase.  Deal 544392 should still act as the swing buyback on days that the plant underpulls.  D   FYI.  Anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price, the purchase should be kept whole.  Only the buybacks with Gas Daily pricing take the swings. 
 Done. 
 Channelview I believe.  That's where I put it.  D 
 Jeff,  I will be happy to meet with you on Wednesday.  D 
 I believe that Carlos Rodriguez handles this pipe.  D 
 JW,  Attached is a schedule of Tufoco take for May according to our schedulers.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 We did deliver 30,000 per day to Mobil for Midcon for the month of May.  D 
 Done. 
 Chris,  What credit requirements to you have for a new entity with an "A" credit rating?  Daren 
 OW,  I went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves/mapping we can delete (yellow) and those we can change (orange).  The only curves we will have left are Katy, Waha, HSC, Agua Dulce, and Thompsonville.  I expect to be using Thompsonville in 6 months to a year.  If it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it, that will be fine.  Let me know if you have any questions.    D 
 James,  I just sent a message to Jeff Hodge asking how we can handle this.  I will let you know as soon as I hear something from him. (I left messages with him prior to today to discuss this deal.)  D 
 Jeff,  The message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail I sent you a couple of weeks ago.  We are serving as agent for Tenaska IV, with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the Cleburne plant.  In November, the plant was not running at full capacity, so we sold the excess fuel gas to TXU Fuel and TXU Gas Distribution.  In doing this, we ended up with a net payment owed to Tenaska IV (in normal months, Tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines.  All profits/losses are passed through to Tenaska.  ENA receives a management fee).  Can we pay intercompany bills?  How should we go forward with this agency responsibility?  Daren 
 Suzanne,  Below are the contracts we will need to ship on Guadalupe Pipeline in Texas.  D 
 Bob,  Who is collecting the hard copies or e-mails of contracts?  I've got the Guadalupe contracts now.  D 
 Bobby,  Unfortunately, we will not be able to make it Saturday night.  We will be in Dallas visiting my brother and his wife, sort of a late Christmas get together.  I hate that we are going to miss it, but I will touch base with you later.  Also, please change the e-mail addresses you have for me and Tonya to:  dfarmer70@houston.rr.com and tjfarmer@houston.rr.com   Thanks.  Daren 
  This is what we've got so far.  Due to our agency activity on Lone Star, I do not want to contact them yet.  But, I have a copy of a contract they sent me a couple of months ago we can use.  D 
  look on the texas tab

 Hey, Ken.  We are in sad shape, aren't we?  I was on vacation last week, th= rough Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and = an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that Enron would be = here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things= really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually s= tarted talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes= that I'm not so sure about.  Ed Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over th= e origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and= Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading de= sk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away= .  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the fina= ncial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in Columbu= s.  He's also going to stay in Columbus with this responsibility.  So, this= may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the fam= ily.  The home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My love= ly wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  = It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball g= oes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to H= alloween.  Cole is going to be a policeman, Jake is going to be a jailbird/= prisoner.  Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times, he loves it.= My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation = that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff pl= anned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in Sa= n Antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we= did things around here (like Children's Museum).  Big game coming up this weekend.  Do you think your Huskers can pull it off= ?  I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.  How about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?  Later.  D 
 Done,. 
 Bob,  Tom is asking aobut the budget info.  When do you think that I can get it?  D 
 Hey, Man.  Can you fix the schedule so that I can play somebody this week?  D 
 All of the Exxon Katy points are in Waller County, Tx.  D 
 The entity I trade with is TXU Gas Distribution.  I verified this with my contact this morning.  So, deal 1085609 is correct.  D 
 I know the following:  1) Gulf Plains plant is in Nueces County. 2) Marathon on Tejas is Galveston County. Check with George to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes.  I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.  For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.  D 
 I believe that we did have some activity on Blue Dolphin, but it was done by the Wellhead group.  You should send the Vol Mgmt people to George Smith.  D 
 FYI. 
 Mike Olsen will be the critical user for Texas. 
 Just wanted to let ya'll know that we get the attached report each week from Vol Mgmt.  We don't have any pending issues (we haven't had many since this started), which I like to see.  Thanks for staying on top of it all.  D 
 The revised weekend nom is attached.  Have a good weekend.  D 
 done. 
 Bob.  I could have sworn that I sent you this information earlier.  But I can't find it in my e-mail anywhere, so here it is:  Highest Priority El Paso Gas Transmission Texas Pipeline (formerly PGE Texas and Valero)	Hub contract, Park & Lend contracts, inter- and intrastate transport East Texas Gas Transmission (Duke Energy Field Services)			Cartwheel agreement, transport  Secondary Priority Guadalupe Pipeline (Duke Energy Field Services)					Intra- and interstate transport Oasis Pipeline									"	"	"	" TXU Gas Distribution (Lone Star Pipeline)						"	"	"	" Houston Pipe Line								"	"	"	" El Paso Field Services Channel							"	"	"	" Oneok Westex (Westar)								"	"	"	" Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (Midcon)						"	"	"	" Tejas Pipeline  The contracts on the pipes listed under "Highest Priority" are required for us to trade in the 3 main areas in Texas (EOL).  We must have these on day one.  The secondary contracts/pipes will be used soon after start up and are ranked in order of importance.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Again, I thought that I sent this to you a couple of weeks ago. Sorry for the delay.  D 
 Elizabeth,  Texas and Wellhead were grouped under George.  I adjusted Texas, but not Wellhead.  I also added the market hubs that we trade, under the pipeline section.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 I'm in. 
 I didn't know if you got this or not.  I love you.  I can't wait to spend the next week with you.  Me 
 Where do you think you're going?  I don't know if I can handle any changes in deal validation.  D 
 We did not sell to TGL for Sept.  D 
 done. 
 Hey Sweet Baby!  I was just thinking of you.  I love you. 
 Sherlyn,  Tuesday, around 2pm works for me and the Texas group.  D 
 How does your afternoon look on Tuesday?  I'm thinking around 2:00.  D 
 Bob,  For the Texas Desk, Mike Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.  As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.  We will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs.  Trading primarily on the Waha, Katy , and Carthage hubs.  I will cover Katy and Carthage.  Mike will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.  I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).  What are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates?  Also, with message of setting up new budgets, can you have Brandy send me a copy of the budget we had in place for Texas 2002?  Thanks.  D 
 I never doubted you.  Thanks.  D 
 Brandee,  Can you look into this?  D 
 I don't have anyone.  D

 The supply from the desk-to-desk transaction (#1075281) is pathed to the transport.  The 1023 contract is an ENA agreement.  So, deal 1075281 transfers the gas to ENA.  ENA then transports the gas on it's agreement on Lone Star.  D 
 Annette,  The transport statement we received from Lone Star did not show that this gas flowed.  That is why we have not paid yet.  We are in discussions with the pipe to find out what happened.  I will let you know as soon as something is determined.  D 
 Megan,  I have created deal # 1075281 to cover a sale from Cleburne to ENA.  I also repathed Unify.  This should clean up the UA4 after the actuals on the old path between Deal 384237 and 502861 are zeroed out.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Hey Ken.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all t= aken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the we= ek before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a = great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of get= ting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them= all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I = was thinking.  Cole wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buz= z Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder = and more excited.  Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents, he= didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up= and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other= day, Cole and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.= Cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was= working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being abo= ut eight feet tall).  Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it. = After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have se= en his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of t= he year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."  = It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister ca= me in the weekend before Christmas.  Tonya's parents and sister came in Fri= day.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downsta= irs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  = That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord= for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.  How was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids we= re in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys = bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  Tonya's dad an= d I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of bal= ls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sens= e, does it?

 Done. 
 Bryce,  Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group.  I need someone to look into deal Sitara #833675, referenced below.  Why were these deals actualized to zero?  D 
 Thanks.  The fax we received from the plant reported the start up at 11:00am, reaching full capacity at 1:00pm.  But, we shouldn't have a problem.  D 
 Its working.  I love you alot. 
 Elizabeth,  Can you re-send the file with the attachement?  I accidentally deleted the first message and I don't have access to the file online.  D 
 I can go any of the 1st 3 weeks of Dec.  D 
 he doesn't have to go if you will wear the horns and play the buck like he does. 
 Anthony,  Can you change the counterparty name on deal 93836 to Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc.?  D 
 done. 
 none 
 Hey, Ken  We had a good holiday.  Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours.  Last night it took 12.  Other than that everything was good.  Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word).  Watched a little football.  Our game with Texas was much better than I expected.  I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that.  And the OU game...I love college football.  It is so much more exciting than the pros.  Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85.  The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today.  I think that we are close to the end.  Layoffs should be announced tomorrow.  So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game?  20 footer?  We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights.  Jake doesn't know what's going on.  But, Cole is all excited.  Everything he sees, he wants for "Chrimsas".  Knowing Jake, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down.  We'll see how it goes.  I hope you had happy holiday, even with the game.  D 
 Anthony,  Can you take care of this? 
 I sent an e-mail to anthony campos on the 19th asking him to change the counterparty.  I don't have the access to do that.  If he can change the name, then we won't have to create a new deal and re-path.  I just sent him another message today.  D 
 I just found out that Anthony has changed responsibilities.  He said that he forwarded the message to Bridgett ?.  I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.  D 
 Have you taken care of this? 
 I'm here.  but barely.  last couple of days we've just been battleing problems and putting out fires.  hanging in though.  this just seems so unreal.  i can't believe we are doing this.  personally, i've got options, so i'm not too worried.   D 
 done. 
 Well, I'm here.  We are not trading.  Actually, we are just hanging around, playing games and shooting the breeze, waiting for the next news story.  It's really odd.  It really is sad seeing all the layoffs.  Especially, when I think of the $ the bigwigs carry home while the honest working people search for a way to earn a living.  Anyway, things are fine for me and the family.  I'd better go.  We've got a crossword competition starting.  D 
 Mike - here you go.  You might as well bridge back the pipes now and be done with it.  Let me know when you start this and I will help if you want me to.  D 
 Bob,  We have the following net-outs in place at the Exxon Katy Plant:  Texas Energy Transfer Buy	10 @ HSC-.0575 Buy	2   @ 2.60 Buy  	2   @ 3.40 Buy 	2   @ 2.465 Sale	15 @ Katy GD-.0175 Sale	1   @ 2.79   As for contracts we will need as a new company:  IT transport (intrastate and interstate) on the following pipes:  TXU Lone Star Oasis EPGT (PGE Valero) HPL Midcon Westar Channel East Texas Gas Systems (ETXG) Duke Guadalupe  Park and Lend contract on EPGT.  Hub (or wheeling) contracts on EPGT and ETXG.   Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 done. 
 What's the big deal?  It's only one digit...But, if it will make you happy, I will fix it.   D 
 where are you going? 
 I'm sure that the Panenergy deal is all yours.  I definitely understand your concerns.  Good luck over there.  D 
 Home: 281-288-8251 Cell: 281-503-8732  Cell will be the best way to contact me.  I will be out Thurs and Fri of this week.  D 
 Jeff,  I left a voice mail message for you yesterday about our role as agents for the Tenaska IV's Cleburne plant.  I wanted to make sure that you got the message.  Please give me a call when you get a chance (3-6905).  D 
 The 4429 is good. D 
 Bob,  I highlghted some changes on your spreadsheet.  Look over these and call me if you have questions.  A couple of the deals have Gas Daily tiers, so I moved them down in the sheet.  I would like for you to make the changes tomorrow after trading.  D 
 I've been trying to call ya'll.  Both lines. One keeps ringing.  The other one gives a busy signal sometimes, keeps ringing sometimes.  Is the answering machine not hooked up?  Or are ya'll not clicking over?  Anyway.  We're doing fine.  Just wanted to let you know that I tried to call. d 
 Isn't the deal pathed from Exxon King Ranch (Deal 210722) to Reliant?  D 
 Megan,  We didn't operate HPL in a way where we matched markets with specific supplies.  The supply for these sales was the entire HPL system.  You can calculate the WACOG on HPL as an estimated cost for each day or month.  But I can't give you a specific supply cost or deal.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 Gas Logistics:  Mike Olsen Jay Smith  Laura Vuittonet has all of their info.  D 
 We had to get the gas from somewhere.  Did Tejas owe HPL gas and make the delivery to settle an imbalance?  It looks like ENA transported the gas on Tejas for Feb.  Have you checked to see if ENA transported on Tejas for Mar?   D 
 Brandee,  You're in the system now.  thanks.  D 
 Hey Cliff,  Which Rogue Spear do you have?  D 
 I have created deal 1150179 to cover this supply.  Mike - Please see that this gets pathed in MOPS and POPS and let Megan know when completed.  Thanks.  D 
 OW,  What do you think about the orig deduct?  How do we usually handle orig on something like this?  D 
 For. 
 No changes. 
 FYI 
 Karen,  Mike Olsen currently reports to me.  I fully recommend Mike as a candidate for the Origination Track.  I don't think that he has decided which path he wants to take regarding his future, but I know that he would be very interested in discussing this track.  Please contact him at your convenience.  Thanks.  Daren

  Hey, Derrick  Thanks for the golf journal.  I'm looking forward to using it.  I've read through most of it already, and it looks easy enough to follow.  Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.  I know the tips will help me.  Keeping notes is good idea also.  Thanks, also for the golf towel.  I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.  Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.  If I play like the last time (when David and I played over Christmas), I'll be buying balls from the club house.  Anyway, I hope you are doing well.  D 
 I believe that I have received your message in error. My name is Daren Farmer and I work in the Texas gas trading area for Enron.  If you will send the name of the person and department you are trying to contact at Enron, I will assist you in communicating with that person.  Thanks.  Daren Farmer 
 None. 
 hey Ken,  Let's do lunch next week.  We are moving into the new building this weekend.  I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).  We had a tough football weekend.  It's about time we got beat.  We didn't deserve the wins we had.  Anyway, I've got to get to work.  Trying to break $12.00 today.  It's kind of odd...moving into a brand new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...  D 
 Done. 
 ENE @ 9.90?  I don't think I will be able to eat for a week.  Maybe you should bring a bullet next week and put me out of my misery. 
 FYI.  I set you up as our man.  There is nothing that you have to do.  I ba= sically just reserved a second desk, computer, etc for us in this building = in the case that we have problems with the move.  D 
 Brandee,  Who does Tanya Smith report to?  What will she be doing?  D 
 ok 
 none 
 I don't have any problems with this.  D 
 Rita,  I began digging further into how this was scheduled yesterday.  It does not look very good.  I will re-work it today and let you know when I'm done.  D 
 AC,  Are you still there?  D 
 Done. 
 Mike,  I very much appreciate what you have done for our desk.  Let me look into the promotions within and out of the analyst program.  I want to take the best option possible.  D 
 Let's og today if you can, or tomorrow.  I'm available anytime after 11:00.  Are you going to try your badge again?  They are reviewing the photos now, along with new scanners.  D 
 We are in the same building.  The move got postponed until next week.  Using the same badges.  I have the same phone #.  Parking is the same.  I believe that the drive down here is open, may be some slowdown on the way out, not sure.  Whew...I think I covered everything.  See you in a little while.  D 
 Rita,  In order to book the imbalance payback between HPL and Lobo, I have created deal 1166748 (ENA selling to AEP @ $2.45).  I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.  From what I understand, we received the gas at King Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.  Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.  With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.  Let me know if you need me to do anything else.  D 
 I really like you Eric and would like to spend some time learning how you are such a master of basis trading.  Jerry D. F. 
 Have you seen this? 
 Julie,  You need to keep the nom and confirm at 3000 so that the buyback calculation will work correctly.  D 
 Bob,  Mike Olsen - Analyst  1 Jay Smith - Specialist 3  Let me know if you need explanations.  D 
 Yes 
 Mike olsen will be coming in for the Texas desk.  D 
 Hey baby, honey-bun, goodlookin, goodlovin, sexy sweet thang!  We may need to start talking to Byron or someone about investing and all of that.  Can you find out how much he charges, one visit and continuing?  he sent out an e-mail about ira's.  they are waving fees for those for lifetime thru 12/31/01.  Anyway, I love you. 
 This ticket starts with 7/99 production.  How were all of the other months paid?  D 
 none for me 
 I believe the counterparty changed effective 2/1/01 to El Paso Merchant Energy.  See deals 637225 and 637234.  D 
 A preliminary copy of the Cleburne activity for Oct 2001 is attached.  Mike will be in tomorrow, and will finalize it.  D 
 Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.  Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.  Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.  D 
 You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed w
