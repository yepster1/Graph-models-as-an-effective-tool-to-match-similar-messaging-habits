 I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.  Late Friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of HPL.  The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d.  Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at Gas Daily.  I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday forward.  Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact.  We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary.  D 
 Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also. You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.  The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time involved in updating the deal.  D

 BH,  Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to hire an additional person, this will change.  Let me know if you have any questions on my list of accomplishments.  D 
 Is putting up with a bossy, domineering assistant,  who makes fun of me, considered an accomplishment? 
 Done. 
 Steve,  I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.  Thanks for your help.  Daren 
 This is a estimate for UA4, fuel, loss, and various other operational usages.  This deal should be handled like the other operational tickets in the system.  D   Aimee Lannou                06/01/2000 11:19 AM 
 Bob,  Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as possible to what we have in the system now.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 You need to get with the East desk on this.  Were they allocated this volume on Tetco?  If so, you can adjust the deal and have the East desk approve it. If they were not allocated this flow, the volume should go on the OBA.  D 
 I have adjusted deal #152638 to cover the first 20 days of flow in Jan.  D 
 Let's keep the current noms in the system for now.  After a few days have flowed, we will look at all the wellhead volumes and adjust if needed.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 The position reports to me and is budgeted.  D 
 Toni,  Attached is the job posting for my group.  Please process this as soon as possible.  Thanks.  Daren 
 June volumes on Tejas are attached. 
 I will be out 6/9 on a customer trip (San Antonio with Aquila).  I will be on vacation in July from 1st-7th.  D 
 CR and AL,  We bought 8000 from Richardson (#245410) at Teco - Lone Star Katy and sold it to Tufco at that point on 5/12/00.  At 3am Tufco cut us on the sale, resulting in only 6,000 flowing to Tufco for the day.  We need to find out what PGE did with the remaining 2,000 we bought from Richardson.  Did they deliverit to us at HPL?  Or did they cut Richardson?  Or, are they showing that we have gas stranded at that point?  Please look into this and let me know.  D 
 AC,  You may need to fax a copy of the invitation for the July trip to Tim.  When I talked to him today, he hadn't seen anything.  (My fault, I turned the names in late.)  The real invitaion should be delivered to him soon.  D 
 HPL is ok.  D 
 Julie,  What info do you have on the Praxair deal (#70171)?  Should this be on ENA or HPLC?  D     Cheryl D King 05/23/2000 09:27 AM 
 Tom,  Please handle this.  The deal is already out there for this time period.  You will probably need to send a zero nom.  D 
 Thanks.  D 
 Nagesh,  Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR. The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position each day.

 I've created deal 269123.  The pricing below looks in correct.  I have used 85% of Gas Daily, instead of Gas Daily less 85% (That would only be 15% of Gas Daily.)  Please verify the price and let me know if we need to change the deal ticket.  Daren

 Is this in index related price? 
 Cheryl,  The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:  City of Brazoria Central Illinois Light Company D & H Gas Company, Inc. Markham Gas Merit Energy Partners Praxair Reliant Energy - Entex Reliant Energy - HL&P Southern Union Company Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co) Union Carbide Corporation Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc   ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)  All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me know if you need something like that.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  D          Cheryl D King 05/10/2000 08:42 AM 
 I have created deal 266962 for the volumes at mtr 6757.  What price is Duke reporting for the mtr 5192 volumes?  The only activity we've had out there is payback with Koch.  D   Aimee Lannou                05/09/2000 03:30 PM

 Bob,  On the Texas desk, the majority of our deals are nominated manually (on Excel or preprinted forms), with most of the information pulled from Sitara instead of Unify.  So, these noms were not late.  For a couple of 3rd party pipelines, we do use Unify.  But we did not have nom changes for 5/4.  Our only problem was sending noms to HPL.  Which is sending information to yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline. This nom was sent about 30 minutes late.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Daren

 Mike,  What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?  I had a few items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.  Since I don't deal with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is:  We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for each meter.  D 
 That's fine 
 Yes, Who is this? 
 I've changed the deal to 1 for the rest of this month and for May.  d   Aimee Lannou                04/25/2000 12:14 PM 
 Go ahead and make those changes.  D 
 Craig re-negotiated this deal, begining with April 2000.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will not be in the office on Friday. 
 Yes, you can create the deal ticket.  D   Aimee Lannou                04/17/2000 10:56 AM 
 Charlotte,  I need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on Channel.  Apparantly, we are moving some gas on Channel from HPL #3455 to HPL #6490. (Deals 83084 and 83088).  Why has this occurred each month?  D 
 March is consistent with Feb. 
 I have created deal 244531 to cover this flow.  Julie - This is actually volume related to the term deal 93804.  Volume flowed in March due to timing on changing the meter.  Can you attach the term contract to this deal?  (I copied the term deal to create the March ticket.)  D   Aimee Lannou                04/14/2000 09:01 AM 
 Leave as is in Sitara. 
 Just leave the nom as is in Sitara.  We will look at all wellheads next week.  D 
 Charlotte Hawkins should be able to help you with this. 
 Have you asked Karry Kendall about this meter? 
 I rolled deal 128952. 
 I have created deal tickets 241558 and 241560 for July 99 - March 00 based on the info below.  Due to time constraints, I have not researched pricing and volumes, I trust that the info supplied to me agrees with the contract.  Robert - We need to get together tomorrow afternoon to set up April.  D 
 Leave the nom as it is in Sitara. 
 What do you mean "leaving Enron"?  Where are you going?  D 
 Please look into this.  D 
 Mtr 1600- A deal already exists for this meter (#159194).  If you view the meter in MOPS you can see the deal.  (It had zero volume before today.)  Mtr 6725 - This gas is traded on the spot market, so there is no deal to put in.  D 
 Mtr 1534 - I created deal 238899 for 3/2-31/00 and #238900 for Apr.  Mtr 6725 - This meter is traded daily (spot) so, we can't extend the deal. When Elsa gets back next week, I will check with her to see if she did a deal with Encina on this day.  D 
 Imelda,  Look on the Texas tab.  I've made some comments beside the names.  These adjustments are for HPLC and Texas.  We no longer handel EFSC.  D 
 Just kidding.  That would not be a problem.  Do I need to give a review of our earlier Sitara training also?  Let me know what you want.  D 
 No, I don't want to. 
 Tom,  Leave the noms the way they are in Sitara.  These volumes are so small, there is no need to adjust anything.  D 
 Steve,  How are things going with this request?  FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.  Thanks.  Daren 
 This is in reference to Sitara # 228914.  Gracias, Amiga.  D 
 Are you going to nom these volumes for the rest of the month?  D 
 This is Daren.  Who are you? 
 yes 
 The deal for March was actually #210507.  I rolled it for one day.  D 
 Is this still outstanding?  Craig is back in the office now.  D 
 Don't we have an OBA at this point now?  D 
 For volumes in excess of the 60,000 on our term agreement which were redelivered to HPL at Mobil Beaumont, we agree to pay Inside Ferc HSC-.045 for the month of March.  The price at which HPL delivered the gas at Eastrans remains at Inside Ferc HSC-.04.  Daren Farmer 
 For April,  We agree to nominate 60,000 into Eastrans.  With redeliveries of:   50,000 into PG&E 7,800 into HPL at Fuels Cotton Valley 2,200 to HPL at Carthage  Pricing for any additional volumes will need to be renegotiated.  You may contact either myself or Stacey Neuweiler.

 Were these deals confirmed?  What are the pipes and contracts?  D 
 I don't have any expected volumes.  You should use the best information you have from prior months.  D 
 We should have everything from Vance by tomorrow (NX2). 
 No, deal 156071 is good for days 7-29. 
 The actuals should be allocated to the new ticket which has been nom'd, tracked. and balanced.  D 
 We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midtex line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy, I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.  D   Aimee Lannou                03/22/2000 01:24 PM 
 Dan,  ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines (listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.  Thanks.  Daren 
 I have created deal 223865 (zero volumes) to cover this name change.  D 
 I have created deal 222844 to cover this meter.  The deal ticket has zero volume.  Just allocate the actuals at the end of each month.  D   Aimee Lannou                03/11/2000 09:49 AM 
 I have extended deal 151669 to cover mtr 9676 for Feb and Mar.  D 
 This deal was done with Greg Stockard.  D 
 George,  Are you looking into these variances?  D 
 ATEs is incorrect.  There should not be a specialist in my group.  D 
 Keep them at 12,000 in Sitara.  D 
 Aimee,  You need to set up a transport capacity ticket in Sitara for this.  Heidi Withers should be able to help you.  I don't know the contract to apply to the deal. Heidi or Julie Meters may be able to help with this also.  D   Aimee Lannou                03/20/2000 12:28 PM 
 Drop the nom to 11,000.  D 
 got it 
 What have they been flowing for the past week?  D 
 Make the nom change.  D 
 I extended the deal at mtr 6719 to include 2/10.   In the future, please run all wellhead deals through Tom Acton first.  I've got a message into Julie Meyers to look into the contract at meter 9676, and will let you know what she determines.  D 
 Julie,  Is the contract with Cokinos on deal 151669 valid for Feb and Mar 20000?  D 
 The bridgeback will take care of changing the volumes from the 1st.  D 
 Hold off on changing the noms.  Let's see how they flow over the weekend and decide on Monday or Tuesday on whether to make adjustments or not.  D 
 Don't bother with changing the nom.  D 
 Please CC Stacey neuweiler and Ami Chokshi on any wellhead changes. Thanks.  D 
 Virginia,  Please reserve a spot for me at the Pig Out Luncheon on 3/15.  Thank you.  Daren

 Hey Sweet Baby!  Can you answer this?  I love you. 
 Mike,  The following attachment contains the error message I received when trying to log in to POPS.  I need to get this fixed as soon as possible, since it is used to assist with our trading activities.  Thanks for your help.  D 
 Hey Ken,  Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you, but...We've had an interesting couple of weeks here.  Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some time off (I think that this is the 4th week).  So, we have picked up his trades.  Tom restructured the EOL trading.  Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.  (I'm still responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during trading.)  In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.  And, of course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore). He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.  I don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.  I am getting very frustrated with the whole business.  It doesn't see that he even appreciates the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack. Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest.  Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.  I think that baby is going to come along any
