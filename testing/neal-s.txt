 US Govt. data -   Business inventories rose 0.9% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations of a 0.6% rise and matching the revised May figure. Retailers saw the biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in June. Total business sales were also up 0.9% in June, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1% rise posted in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low. In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July, double the pace in June. Industrial production, which measures output at U.S. factories, utilities, and mines, is now 5.8% stronger than it was this time last year, due mainly to continued growth in high-tech manufacturing. >

 A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.  1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to replace Access and to handle basis trading. The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4  2000.   The basis products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float), Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.  2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board in the    next few weeks.  3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the weekly storage data.  4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount through the Hub for volume commitment.   Please let me know if you have any questions.
