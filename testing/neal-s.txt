.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST). *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non- discriminatory basis. *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet. *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available. *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied. *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to all bidders through an Internet-based system.   ``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all parties as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.  Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

 Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..  Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows interest in learning. 
 thanks for the info. 
 that sounds fine to me. 
 i will be there. 
 Absolutely! and have a great time.
