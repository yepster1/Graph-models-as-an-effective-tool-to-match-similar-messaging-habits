 Traci,  I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday. One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship. He came across as a very bright person, very personable.  I can take him as a summer intern.  Vince 
 Todd,  Thanks for the opportunity to speak at the conference. It was a great pleasure to see you again.  Zimin Lu briefed me about Tuesday and Wednesday and told me the presentations were very interesting.  Vince 
 Praveen,  Monday (1/21), 11 p.m. is confirmed.  Vince 
 Angelika,  Sorry for a short notice but unexpected is part of the corporate life. Zimin will cover both my presentation and the workshop - he is a very good speaker and I am sure he will do a better job that I could do.  Vince 
 Gayle,  I got home quite late last night. Here is the title of the presentation:  Volatility of Energy Prices in the US Markets. Implications for Market and Credit Risk Management.   Vince 
  FYI   Vince 
 Brian,  What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.  There are several bars at the center.  The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more interesting - it's a comedy day.  Vince 
 Hee Jung,  Thanks. Do you have your resume by any chance? I could keep it on file for future reference.  Vince

 Stan,  Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to offer the help of my group in providing analytical support in evaluating different options that are open to us.  One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts, but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities. He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation is attached.  Please, feel free to ask Jim Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.   Vince Kaminski

Please, let me know what you decide to do over the next few days. The curtain will drop on my group on Tuesday.  In case we shall not connect before Tuesday, let me say it was a privilege working with you. I wish you luck with Enron or any other company you may work for in the future.  Vince

  Bob,  Additional info from Cindy Skinner.  Vince 
  Whom can you recommend? So many people have left.  Vince 
 Mike,  What do you think? I see pro's and con's. The argument against is that during PRCs people comment positively or negatively about a person and this is how the word is spread about an employee. Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.   Vince

 Rakesh,  You will receive an update on the situation tomorrow.  Vince 
 Rakesh,  I can extend you leave of absence till January 15.  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks for contacting me about this. As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.  I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus 10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager. Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).   On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron. Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge. Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.  Vince 
  Khymberly,  I am forwarding you a resignation letter from C. Supatgiat. Thanks for your help today.  Vince 
 Ronda,  I am not surprised you have no attendees from Enron. We can pay neither  for the conference nor for the trip to New York. I shall be glad to talk to you about the conference but I cannot attend in any capacity.  Vince 
 Praveen,  Thanks. I will join you for lunch. I shall reserve time on Friday to give you a guided tour. After Friday it's a different company and access to the floors will be restricted.  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks. Shirley is checking my calendar and will call you about the schedule. The entire week of the 11th does not look good for me.  Vince 
 Steve,  Things seem to be under control as of noon today (Tue). I look fwd to the evening with you, your wife and the rest of the Woodlands gang on Saturday. I eat everything except for broccoli.  Vince 
 Please, cancel my membership in Enron PAC.  Vince Kaminski 
 Resending 
  Mike, Any thoughts?  Vince 
 Bob,  I hope it went to the right Williams the first time.  Vince 
 Wade,  I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.  A brief outline of the facts.  1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy is also very complicated.  2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.  The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department.  I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.  I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.  Thanks.  Vince 
 Please, cancel my membership.  Wincenty (Vince) Kaminski

 Hi Julie,  Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the book as the main source. You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock and probably order a few more copies.  I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped with work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.  The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night) but we survived without major problems. The only problem I had was an overflowing swimming pool (it took 45 minutes to go  from a comfortable slack to a full condition).  Vince

 Darrell,  I am sending you the first document for review. It's a new algorithm invented by Rabi De and Tanya.  The credit paper has been written but it needs more work before we can send it to you.  I think you will enjoy  the document I am attaching.   Vince

  Hector,  Thanks for the update. I am likely to come to CMU this semester (recruiting). I shall get in touch with you.  Vince 
 Paolo,   I could not open the attachment. My system needs a file in .doc or .pdf format. M/S Word or Acrobat.   Vince 
 Anne,  No problem. I have retained Debra to offer a course for 20 persons in October. You are very welcome to attend.  Vince 
 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 Rakesh,  I don't think I have to be involved.  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks. I shall be leaving early on Thursday  for California: my family is moving back to Houston.  I shall ask Vacant to attend.  Vince 
 Paolo,  I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension .pdf  and begin with teh same string of characters. Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.   My fax number is 713 646  2503.  Vince 
 Mike,  Let's call Paul. I want to discuss this with him.  Vince 
 Billy,  We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.  He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area. When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would complain that the question is too detailed.   He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).   Vince 
 FYI   Vince

 Ian,  The same to you. I wish you a very Happy New Year.  Vince 
 http://www.ratherbiased.com/ 
 Aruna,  I shall be available next week, except for Friday.  Vince 
 Mark,  Thanks a lot. Looks really interesting.  Vince 
 Paul,  I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.  1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process) last Friday, as far as I can remember.  Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things: a. We would be delighted to have him here. b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives your blessing before we can move ahead. We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and Mike Roberts.  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was told you were out sick.  3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next 3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.  4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.  I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.  I hope it helps. Cheers.   Vince 
 Mark,  The members of my group attend INFORMS conferences and I shall check today if we are covering this specific meeting.  We shall be glad to speak with Dr. O'Hara when he comes to Houston. I shall be gone on Friday, but you can contact Sandeep Kohli in Houston to discuss the details. Any date in the time interval given by you works for us.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Sandeep,  This is Dr. Ueneohara. The spellchecker has done it for me. Sorry.  Please, make sure that I am involved in the meeting. Also, include Bob Lee, Rakesh, Vasant, Zimin, Krishna, Paulo, Alex, Tanya, Rabi.  Vince 
 FYI   Vince 
 It's done.  Please, check.  Vince

 Gina,  I was thinking about calling you and suggesting an "Italian only" lunch. I can also introduce you to my associate, Rakesh Bharati, who studies Italian on his own.  What about Tuesday next week?   Vince 
 Paul,  I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmed that he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did not receive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue.  I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals. He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.  My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his social intelligence.   Vince 
 Laura,  We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the demand model.  Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas available in the short run. We have some good insights into this problem as well.  My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron. I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures to keep them away from critical information. Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.  I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.   Vince 
 Krishna,  Who can review Rusty? I think he deserves an offer.   Vince 
  Shirley,  Please, keep an eye on this event to make sure we don't drop the ball for Rusty.  Vince 
 Krishna,  Resending just in case. Who can review Rusty?   Vince 
 Jacek,   Do you have a formal presentation about your company and the services you offer? Any web site? I would like to pass on the information I received fro Jurek Jarosz but I need something more tangible to start the process.  Vince Kaminski Enron (713) 853 3848 
 Shirley,  Please set up a lunch meeting with Mike Roberts and myself and Jose Molina (please, see below) next week. We can meet over sandwiches.  Vince 
 Mike,  I asked Shirley to set up a meeting over sandwiches with Jose Molina (please, see below).  Vince 
 Michael,  The person who can help you is Zimin Lu. Due to the death in his family, he will be unavailable in the next few days. Please, work directly with me to coordinate the project. We can meet tomorrow (Tuesday or Wednesday) for 15 minutes to discuss the details.  Vince (713) 853 3848 
 Vasant,  It think he deserves an offer. Can you write an evaluation for him?  Vince 
  Mike,  Can we help this guy?  Vince 
 Alex,  I could not open the attachment. Please, send it as a MS Word document or a .pdf file.   Vince 
 Pilar,  I will attend.   Vince Kaminski 
 Claudio,  The weather bond project looks like a well - defined project. It should result in an interesting term paper.  Vince 
 Zulie,  I shall attend the Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m.   Vince Kaminski 
 FYI  Vince 
  Shirley  Please, set up a phone interview with this guy. The usual suspects: Zimin, Alex, Bob.  Vince 
 Michael,  3:30 today works for me. We can meet at EB1938 for about half an hour. I shall introduce you to my associate who will work on the project.  Vince 
 Alex,  Thanks a lot. I could open our resume. We hire part-time employees to help us with our weather effort: the work is concentrated in the early morning hours 6:00 to 10:00 a.m.  I shall check with Mike Roberts who runs the group about our needs.  Please, let me know if you are interested in a summer internship in 2002. The decisions are made in late January and February and you should let me know by then.  Vince 
 http://www.latimes.com/business/la-000060023jul23.story 
 Sandeep,  Please, ask them if they can accept our invitation to lunch following the meeting?   Vince 
 Alex,  Thanks. I think it's a low risk proposition. He is just an associate.   Vince 
 Chris,  I read your paper with great interest. I shall be glad to give you my comments. Please, feel free to call me at 713 853 3848.   Vince 
 Praveen,  Thanks for your message. Confirmed.   Vince 
 Bob,  FYI  Vince 
 Gina,  It's a deal.  Vince

 Alex,  I have forwarded your message to Mike Roberts.  Vince 
 Alex,   Yes, please go ahead.  Vince 
 Eric,  Thanks.  Vince 
 John,  Would you like me to use the slides you attached or expand/replace them with some additional material.   Vince 
 Jacek,  It would help to have a presentation to start the discussion. We can wait till September.  Vince 
 John,  I shall expand your slides by adding a few more. I shall rely on your judgment: you know better what is the level of sophistication of the students.  See you tomorrow.   Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Mike,  Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit. I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed. Makes no sense to sound too apologetic.  Another observation. I have just talked to Christian and suggested a conference call Monday evening our time with Paul. You can mention this conference call  request to Paul. The oservation: Christian may be smart but he will one hell of a person to manage given his personality.  Vince 
 Steve,  Yes, They are coming. It makes sense for Shirley to confirm it on Friday for you (I shall be in Dallas) before you hop on  the plane.  The meeting start at 9:00 at the Greg's office. Hope to see you on Monday.  Vince 
  Norman,  Thanks for your message. I treat the Monday meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to Prediction Company and to inform you about Enron's trading operation and especially about our electronic trading platforms. The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future collaboration. We are especially interested in working with you on improving the algorithms that support our electronic market making functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offer spreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currently a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.  I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets and we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory character of the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company participation is limited to you and Jim. We shall, of course, be glad to meet with other associates that you may decide to bring to Houston with you. We shall be also glad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.  Enron side will be represented by Greg Whalley,  President & COO of Enron Wholesale Services, and myself. We expect John Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, and my colleague from London, Dr. Steve Leppard, to join us. Shirley is forwarding the agenda and some additional information to you tonight.  You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail addres: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home (281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting you on Sunday.  Vince Kaminski 
 Steve,  Shirley  sent you the info about the dinner,  in case you can arrive in time to join us on Sunday evening. Please, let me know, so that I can adjust the reservation at the restaurant.  Bob Lee may be out (a possible operation).  You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail address: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home (281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396.

 Any interest in James?   Vince 
  Rick,  Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak at this conference? Our friends at UT were very disappointed last time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.  Vince 
 Ehud,  Thanks. I shall get in touch with Mike and the Analyst /Associate program.  Vince 
  Billy,  I received a request to make a presentation to the Energy Finance class at UT this fall. It makes sensed to coordinate my trip with your unit presentation to the MBA students at the UT. Please, let me know who is the person to coordinate this request with?   Vince

 Dear Dr. Uenohara,  I would like to thank once more you and your colleagues for visiting Enron and for your most interesting presentation.  We all look forward to working with you in the future.   Vince Kaminski 
 Joannie:  Thanks Here is the message for Jeff:    Jeff,  I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner (February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).  This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda for the 2002 event is under development.   Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the agenda for the future.   Vince Kaminski 
 Kim,  Thanks. I shall ask Shirley to schedule a lunch in 2-3 weeks for me and Krishna with you. Krishna is about to become a Daddy again in a few days; the end of August should work for him.  Vince 
 I shall attend East Power presentation as well.  Vince 
 Joannie,  Thanks. I think dinner is a better forum for Jeff.  Vince 
 Ehud,  Jeff agreed to participate. I suggested dinner as a better forum to Jeff's secretary. The decision regarding lunch/dinner issue is still to be made.  Vince 
 Steve,  Praveen is coming in tomorrow. We shall figure out a way to give you a great recommendation.  I always appreciate your trading suggestions.  What about P, OXY, DVN, PGN, LU, EMC?   Vince 
 Steve,  Two things.  1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503? I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but want to make sure I did not miss any important point.  2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship, how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly, Houston? Please, let me know.  Vince 
 Mike,  This is what some people in  the industry see.  Vince 
 Greg,  A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.  I. Projects (in the order they suggested it).  1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.  2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without full trade automation.  3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.  II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.  1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of Enron's participation.  2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.  3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.   Recommendations:  1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.  2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship with UBS.  3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from Prediction Company. 
 Sheridan,  I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call about this. I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at San Antonio. Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study. Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area, regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values.  It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling. It would also help if you could write a formal letter to him.   Vince 
 Norman,  Thanks. Talk to you soon.  Vince 
 Anita,  Can you call Maureen and ask if she plans to come to the office?   Vince

 Steve,  Prediction Company was confused. No problem - I got the outline from memory and I shall cc you. I shall attach your minutes to my memo for Greg.   Vince 
 Greg,  A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company. More detailed notes by Steve are attached.  I. Major potential projects (in the order they suggested it).  1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.  2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without full trade automation.  3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.  Any project would require review of the market data provided by Enron.  (Is it a  free option for them? -  VK)  II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments per project, and   fees per transaction.  1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of Enron's participation.  2. Payment per project that would look like consulting fees. They would like a lump-sum payment first (to expand the staff), followed by consulting fees later.  3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.   Recommendations:  1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.  2.

 Liz, Greg:  Frank Wolak from Stanford will be back in the office on Tuesday, August 7. I hope to set up a meeting with him and then to finalize the meeting with Prediction Co.  I shall be shooting for August 23 - 24, in view of Greg's trip on the 15th and 16th.  I left a message for Norman Packard, telling him that I should be  able to get back to him regarding the trip to Santa Fe by Tuesday this week.  The first draft of the non-disclosure agreement will be ready by Tuesday or Wednesday.  Have a good trip.  Vince 
 Liz,  Frank Wolak can meet Greg and me in his office and  for dinner Thursday night, August 16,  at Stanford.  Can Greg fly to San Francisco or San Jose  from his Asset Tour trip in late afternoon on that day?   If Greg can get a co plane to go San Francisco on Thursday, we could  fly together to Santa Fe on Friday morning, August 17. Norman Packard can meet us on that day. I could go to San Francisco Thursday morning on a commercial flight.   Vince 
 Kevin,  Ed is running a consulting firm in Boston that often tries to act as a boutique merchant bank. He inquired if Enron could provide transmission hedges for the Neptune project.  Any interest. Please, feel free to contact Ed directly and let me know.  Vince 
 Who is the trader that might be interested in this project? I have already forwarded the message to Kevin Presto.  Vince 
 Ed,  Thanks for your message. I have forwarded the message to the head of our power trading desk and to our transmission group.  Hope to hear form them later today.  Vince 
 Tom  FYI. I have forwarded this message to Kevin Presto as well.  Vince 
 Bob,  Do you have a standard presentation on Enron's role in creating and growing the spot and forward markets for pulp and paper?  We are helping the media group to make a pitch to a big customer ($40 billion in revenues) and we would like to provide some examples of our skills in creating and growing new markets.   Vince  P.S. It's quite urgent: we were asked to help at the eleventh hour. 
 Thanks for a very quick turn around.  Vince 
 Norman,  Thanks for your message. Still struggling with a trip schedule, trying to reconcile many different itineraries. I should connect with Greg who is in London and firm the plans up  by tomorrow morning.  I am attaching a draft of a non-disclosure agreement. Please, take a look at it at your leisure and let me now what  you think.  I have also FedExed you some reading materials about the power and natural gas prices.  Vince 
  Please, try to mobilize the members of the group who have not made a contribution yet. Research is shown as a separate group in all the reports and we may stand out as unit at the end of this week.  Vince 
 Mike,  We discussed United Way last Thursday when you were on the 32nd floor monitoring the hurricane.  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks for your quick action on Prasanna. He came to us looking for a transfer. I was reluctant to do it in the first place, because we try to avoid poaching other groups. Given that his reviews are less than enthusiastic, we shall write him off.   Vince

 Shawn,  Let's do lunch. It's long overdue. we have been planning it for a long time.   Vince 
 We crossed the 50% participation mark.   Vince 
 Rabi,   Congratulations.  Vince 
 Marc,  We already have a basket option model that we can adapt for this transaction.  I shall talk with Sandeep and Vasant about it.  Vince 
 I will attend.  Vince Kaminski 
 Hello John,  Thanks for the lead. I have seen other papers on this topic.  Vince 
  Liz,  FYI. Can we firm up either date? I am getting the impression they are getting impatient.   Vince 
  FYI  Vince 
 Gwyn,  Congratulations.  Vince 
 Sheridan,  I am going out to lunch with Rick Buy today and will mention the valuation seminar. I shall ask Rick how many employees from his group he would send to this program.  I have no suggestions regarding the program, except that the last year selection of topics was very interesting. You can include e-bus and on-line trading as the topics for 2002.   My address is:  1400 Smith Houston, TX 77002 - 7361 Room EB1962   Vince 
 Mike,  Great idea. My son built his own computer. He can help.  Also, we are meeting Greg for 10 mins on Monday.  Vince 
 Norman,  My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.  Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in Northern England. The accident coincided with Greg's trip to London and Greg got immersed in all the problems related to it.  I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back to Houston.   Vince 
 Terry 281-296-0573 
 Eric,  Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far? I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/ interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system). I think our participation may a bit higher.  Vince 
  FYI,  We need to get to at least 80%.  I am also talking to Erik Thode: I am afraid he has a list of the group distorted by the summer employees who cannot contribute even if they want to (they are not in the system).   Vince 
 Vasant,  Thanks. FYI. Our internal RAC models assign roughly BB credit rating to Enron.   Vince 
 Hello,  Thanks for your message. I think that we can resume our discussions in a few months. We have currently a large group of highly skilled Enron employees who, given that we have effectively an internal labor market, are looking for alternative positions. We are giving them a priority in the hiring decisions.  Vince 
 Thanks.  Vince 
 Nelson,  I fully agree. They are free to donate as much as they want to charity as they wish, but it does not have to be through Enron.  Vince 
 Hello Chris,  Thanks for your message.  The first two pages look like an good opening to an article on a spark spread option.  A few comments.  1. A spark spread model has two primary uses. It can be used for pricing stand alone options traded in the OTC markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation model of a generation plant.

 Eric,  Oren Zimmerman ( # 19) resigned and  should be removed from the list. Numbers 15 & 12 are part-time employees, a high school and college students, respectively, and we should not consider them in the total as well.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Tom, Lance, Martin,  This meeting is regarding Brazil and hydro conditions in this country. Let's meet Wednesday to talk about the ways we can contribute to solving this problem. Tom, where do we stand with SDDP?   Vince 
  Joe,  I can bring to the meeting some members of my group who support power modeling and have experience with hydro systems and transmission. Do you want me to include them in the meting? I understand it's about Brazil.  Vince 
 Yes, they are in the acquisition mode. I think the stock will do OK long-term.  Vince 
 Diane,  I will have it for you shortly.  Vince 
 Hello Christie,   It makes sense to invite somebody from EIM (Ray Bowen?) to the luncheon.  By the way, what is the location?  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Martin, Tom,   Can you join me at the meeting with Joe Kishkil on Thu, 1:00 p.m. re Brazil hydro problems?  Vince 
 Ryszard,  Go to the Lacima web site (http://www.lacimagroup.com/) and you can buy the book directly.  Wicek 
 Diane,  This is the headcount projection for 2002. I am slightly above my plan for 2001 that I am under performing now.  Sorry for the delay.  Vince 
  Shirley,  Please, let's review it and see if any re-class is involved.  Vince 
 Norman,  Sorry  for a delay in responding to you. The trip this week, August 17, is impossible. As you know by now, our CEO, Jeff Skilling, resigned today and Greg will be tied up in analyst calls for the next few days.  We still hope to be able to visit you on the 24th, as long as you are still available on this day.  Just in case, please advise me about you availability on Friday, August 31st.   Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Frank,  Sorry for a delay in responding to your message. As you can imagine, after Jeff Skilling's resignation, Greg Whalley will be tied up in a few additional stock analysts' presentations.  We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine and would like very much to meet and exchange opinions with you.  Please, advise me about your availability during the next 2 - 3 weeks. Hopefully, we can reconcile our schedules and meet soon.  Vince 
 Scott,  Thanks for the message. I have talked to HR today and they will be contacting you regarding the offer.  We shall work out the details this week. Of course, we have to go through our usual procedures and I leave it to our HR department.  Vince 
  Great. A big jump in participation.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Liz,  FYI. This is the person at Stanford Greg would like to meet.  Vince 
 Hi Joe,  I called you Tuesday and left a message on your voice mail.  Jeff's address is:  jeff.skilling@enron.com   Vince 
  Liz,  An update on Frank's availability at Stanford.   Vince 
 Osman,  Here it is. Sorry for the delay.  Vince 
 Liz,  What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip? Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.  We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before.  Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer, Mark Taylor, as well.  Vince 
 Anne,  Shalesh told me that his visited his HR screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an Associate. This entry was reversed later.  Any reason for that? It may be related to his transfer from EBS. We can check with his previous business unit whether they gave /promised him a promotion.   Vince 
 Liz,  We can schedule the trip sometimes between September the 3rd and September the 5th. I was shooting for Friday only because it worked better for Greg.  Vince 
 Brian,  It sounds great. I know from personal experience that it's much better to d= evelop a new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expecta= tions. If you don't manage the management, they will give you zero credit for the idea, and a lot of grief for slow deployment.  I see the usefulness of this technology in many places where we trade power= .  Is it OK to consult one my associates (Martin Lin) and  ask him for his opinion? He knows infinitely more about transmission than I do.  A lunch / dinner at a Sardinian restaurant would be great. I spent a summer in Sardinia in 1970.  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks for a very quick (as always) reaction. I want to ask you for another favor. Can you send me the list, for my files, of promotions after the last PRC?   Vince 
 Martin,  Any thoughts on this project?  Vince 
 John,  I will teach the option class in the spring (starting sometimes in February). I don't see any problem if you want to audit the  class.  Vince 
 Jim,  What about 2 p.m., my time, on Friday, August 17. If this works for you, I shall try to invite a lawyer who wrote the draft of the non-disclosure agreement.  Vince 
 Brian,  Another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place.  As you know, Brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage. About 95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of water in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.  Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil are asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These objections may not apply to Brazil.  Can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from Sao Paulo to discuss the problem? He will be  back in his office on Tuesday .  I shall call you tomorrow about it. What is your phone number?  Vince 
 Marshall,  Thanks. My assistant will call him to confirm.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Brian,  Thanks. I shall ask Shirley to set up a conference call with Remy on Tuesday. You can come up to the 19th floor if you wish. I shall ask Martin Lin to join us well.  Vince 
 Eric,  FYI  Vince 
 Nelson,  Thanks.   Vince 
  Brian,  FYI  Vince 
 Laura,  Sorry for a delay in responding to  your previous message.  My boss, Greg Whalley will be traveling a lot during the next 2 weeks, visiting different offices of Enron. It seems at this point that we may be able to visit  you in Santa Fe in the first part of the week of September the 3rd. Please, advise me of your availability.  I apologize for our inability to commit to a firm date at this point. I would like to assure you of our continuing interest in working with you in the future.   Vince 
 Jim,  Confirmed.  Vince

 Billy,  I have received an invitation to speak to a graduating class of the Quantitative and Computational Finance program at Georgia Tech. The URL is included in the message below.  Would you be interested in arranging for  a presentation at this school about the A/A Program, coinciding with my visit?  Vince 
 Tom,   Select on of the courses. Hard to say which one is the best.  Vince 
 I consider  attending a course you are teaching. Can you, please, send me an electronic version of the booklet "Introduction to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Third Edition"   Vince Kaminski Managing Director Enron Corp. 
 Dear Mr. de la Fuente,  I appreciate the  invitation to the conference on Ten  Years of Electricity Deregulation and Restructuring. I shall be able to make a decision next week.   Vince Kamnski 
  Tanya,  Can you help this guy?  Vince 
 Jim,  I shall call you from my office (713) 853 3848 at 2 p.m. Is 505-984-3123 OK?  Vince 
 Dear Samantha,  My associate, Steve Leppard, sent me a message about a conversation he had with you regarding books on quantitative aspects of trading different commodities.  I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from a very general introduction to different commodity markets to highly technical treaties) and about the contribution  Enron could make.  You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, "Managing Energy Price Risk", 2nd edition. This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published so far. It is a good starting point to a conversation about different  options you might consider.  Please, feel free to give me a call. My direct number is 713 853 3848.  Vince Kaminski 
 Milind,  Here are my coordinates  in case you want to contact me when the Enron address and phone numbers are no longer operational:  Vince Kaminski 10 Snowbird The Woodlands, TX 77381 (281) 367 5377  vkaminski@aol com   Happy Holidays to You and George.   Vince 
 Billy,  Your recommendation makes sense. It's a new program and we have no data points about its quality.  I shall inform my contact that you have already fully committed your resources and cannot make  anymore campus trips. I shall offer to collect the resumes and distribute them within Enron.   Vince 
 Brian,  Talk  to Marge Nadasky. She can get a discount of 15% for an Enron employee.  Vince 
 Sam,  Looks great. Plz, go ahead as soon as the equations are in.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Patrick,  Thank you. I have forwarded the resume to my friend at AIG.  Vince 
 Traci,  Thanks.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
  Sally,  We were approached a few months ago regarding this benchmarking study. You and I decided jointly against Enron's involvement in this project.  They have approached us again. Any thoughts?  Vince 
 Theresa,  I have forwarded this message to a number of executives at Enron and we shall meet to discuss this project.  Vince 
 Mike,  Take a look at the comment on AGA.  Vince 
 Shirley,  I would like to commit to October 4. Any other engagement?  Vince 
 Shirley,   No.   Vince 
  Zimin,  Did I talk to you about it?   Vince 
 Shawn,  11:50 - 11:55 would be fine.  Vince 
 Hello Tricia,  It was nice to hear from you. What are your coordinates?  Vince 
 Joe,  We are in process of setting up a phone interview with him.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Can you set up a phone interview with him. VK, ZL, VS  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Joe, Jeff  It seems MS wants to be only on one side of the transaction. I think it re  Joe, Jeff  It's interesting MS wants to be only on one side of the transaction. I think it reflects their ability to hedge. Any other thoughts?  Vince

 Tanya  No problem.  Vince 
 Visit,  Please, send me your address and I shall send you a reprint.  Vince 
 Rudi,  Makes sense. Let's meet with Gordon. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting.  Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?  I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's liquidity at some point.  Vince 
 Karen,  I shall forward the message to number of my friends with an experience  and contacts in the industry. They may be able to give you some leads.  Vince 
 Molly,  Jill is a daughter of my friend. She contacted our Analyst/Associate Program but her background makes her a better candidate for an HR position. Do you know  if we are looking for somebody with her skills?  Vince 
 Zimin,  Let's send flowers.  I don't think a transfer is an issue that  should be brought up during a hospital visit. Zhiyong  does not need any more stress (I speak from experience - I had a car accident).  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks. I shall give you the review forms by Friday.  Also, I did cc you on a msg re my friend's daughter resume. She is looking for an HR position. Do you see any need in your department?  Vince 
 Anne,  Yes, I got the forms. It remains to be seen when I talk to Greg about it.  Vince 
 Cassandra,  We can wait till Rudi comes back an then we can meet. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting with you and Rudi and Gordon next week.  Vince 
 Rakesh,  HC stands for ...?  Vince 
  Any comments on this person?  Vince 
 Sean,  This was exactly the advice I gave to Zimin this morning.  Vince 
 Adrianne,   Thanks   Vince 
 Paolo,  I should finish the review in a day or two. We were quite busy here in Enron for the last few days.  Vince 
 Jonathan,   Thanks.  Vince 
 Therese,  Done. Please check.  Vince 
 Nelson,  Thanks for you effort.  Vince 
 Laura,  Given Greg Whalley's schedule, the best day for us to visit with you at Santa Fe would be Wednesday, September the 5th. WE would arrive from San Francisco, early in the morning and we could stay through the day.  Please, let me know if this date would work for you.  Vince 
 Frank,  Thanks for your message.  What about a meeting on Tuesday, September the 4th. We could meet at your office, let's say at 4 p.m. We would be delighted if you could join us for dinner later in the evening on the same day.   Vince 
  FYI. The first leg of the trip has been confirmed.  Vince. 
 FYI   Vince 
 Liz,  It's in Stanford. We can stay at the Stanford Inn Hotel Tuesday night and leave early in the morning for Santa Fe on Wednesday.  I am still waiting for Prediction to confirm their meeting on Wednesday.  Vince

 Gina,  Tuesday, August 28 looks good.  Vince 
 Paul,  Thanks for your message. Terry left Enron a few weeks ago after many years with the company. The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586 EB 4712 , steve.kean@enron.com .  I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you. Can you indicate the subject of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?  Vince 
 Richard,  It's nice to hear for you. I know many people at Rice, including the Dean of the Business School, and I can make discreet inquiries on your behalf. Please, let me know if I can approach the Dean or one of the finance faculty members on your behalf.  Vince 
 Joe,  We are working on the JCC project with the crude desk (Vasant Shanbhogue and Nelson Neal are involved in the project). We are meeting with Marc de la Roche tomorrow to present our findings about pricing and hedging.  We shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over the phone.  Vince  P.S. You are right. The margins are fat. It looks like a great opportunity. 
 Joe,  I sent you another msg about our work on JCC. We are meeting Marc de la Roche tomorrow to discuss the JCC projects.  Who is the person in Tokyo we should work with on this project?  Vince 
 Jason,  My personal E-mail address is vkaminski@aol.com  Good luck to you.  Vince 
 Steve,  I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one of his associates.  Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.  Vince 
 Joe,  We shall work with Marc and Kinoshita to get it  done.  Also, we talked to Kiyoshi today  and were very impressed. We shall show his resume to Whalley.  Vince 
 John,  A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.  My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views, the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.  If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups under Mike's leadership.  Please, let me know what you think.   Vince

 Anita,  Should we advise everybody to wait for the results of Martin's evaluation?  Vince 
 Laura,  Thanks for confirming the  meeting on September the 5th.  We shall be coming on a company plane from San Jose and this gives us a lot of flexibility in planning of the agenda.  Please, let me know when would you like to start the meeting and we shall be glad to adjust. I assume you are on Mountain Time and this means we shall lose one hour flying east from California.   Vince 
 Candice,  Thanks for your kind offer. Please, get in touch with us when you come to Houston. We may not be around much longer.  Vince 
 Mike,  I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation, given our relationship with the Wharton School. I  think it can be somebody below Steve's level - the occasion does not justify allocating time of a senior executive.  Vince 
 Thallam,  Thanks for your message. I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713 853 5290), to set up the call with you.  Vince Kaminski 
 Tricia,  Thanks a lot for your message. I am glad things are going well for you. It's quite hectic here as you know. I shall try  to call you later this week to chat about the markets.  Vince 
 Ehud,  Thanks for your  message.  I have talked briefly to Rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute Greg Whalley for Jeff. I assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from Enron than a specific person.  Of course, we have to get on Greg's calendar but I can make these arrangements as soon as I hear from you.   Vince 
  Shirley  Please, inform the group.  Vince 
 Albert,  Thanks. What is the time of the presentation?  Vince Kaminski 
 Dear Dr. Whitaker,  I was contacted a few days ago by my friend, Richard McMinn, who is currently holding the Swiss Re Chair in the Management of Risk,  Centre for Risk and Insurance Studies, Nottingham University Business School. Before moving to England, he was for many years with the University of  Texas at Austin. He is also an editor of The Journal of Risk and Insurance.  Richard expressed interest in coming back to the States, and specifically to Texas. I remember from a number of conversations with you and other rmembers of your staff, that you are thinking about making several additions to the Faculty of Jones School, especially in the area of risk management. Richard is a well qualified candidate that you may consider in your search.  I am attaching the address of Richard's CV. Please, feel free to contact me if you need more information about his academic credentials.  http://www.aria.org/macminn/  Vince Kaminski

 Hello Scott,  Thanks for Sriram. I shall call you later this week with an update on our needs.  Vince 
 Mike,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Richard,  I have made discreet inquiries at Rice and it seems they are looking for somebody with a different profile than the one you represent. I think that the interest is more in a person with more financial institution risk management experience, with special applications to trading and energy trading in particular.  Vince 
 Jim,  Thanks for your message.  We definitely plan to visit with you, as planned, next Wednesday. We shall be flying from San Jose in the morning and we can shoot for 9:30 a.m. arrival at your office, as long as it works for you.  I shall forward your message to our lawyer and ask her to come up with a new version of an NDA.  Look forward to meeting you next week.  Vince 
 Laura,  I have just sent a message to Jim confirming our visit with you on September the 5th. Is 9:30 a.m. OK with you as our arrival time?  Also, please, send me the directions to your location.  Look forward to meeting you on Wednesday next week.  Vince

 Hello Darrell,  Many changes in Enron kept me busy during  the last few days.  Rabi and Tanya are working on a new version of the documentation and we hope to send it to you in a few days.  I agree with you that the document we sent you was rather cryptic and apologize for not screening it more effectively. I agree with you regarding point # 2 and so does Tanya. I think she did not explain precisely what she meant by her comment.  I hope to talk to you soon.  Vince   P.S. We still owe you money for work done over the last 18 months.

Greg Whalley gave us marching orders to treat the development of quantitative models for data mining of EOL trade records as the top priority. I shall be providing Greg bi-weekly updates on the project.  FYI only. I am flying with Greg next week to a meeting with a third party that may be involved in some aspects of this project. I shall tell you more when we meet.  I know that we, as well as Greg, can count on full support and cooperation from you.  I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, to set up a meeting with you next week after I come back from the trip.   Vince

 Jim,  CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a production tool.  We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has) in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later this week.  I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can consider it as commercial product.  Vince

 Mike,  Thanks for the invitation. See you on Friday, April the 27th.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.  Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.  We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.  2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.  3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.  Vince 
 This is the list of projects for the members of the "quant" team. If you are working on different project, please, ignore this message.

 Vasant, Please, take a look at this eresume.  Vince 
 Elena,  Please, prepare for Mulong NG and power price series. We can use  Henry Hub for NG, Cinergy, Cobb and PV for electricity.  We can send him NG price right away. Electricity prices are different: he has to obtain permission from FT (Megawatts Daily). I shall cc you on my msg to him.  Vince 
 Mulong,  We shall send you natural gas Henry Hub prices right away. Please look at the last winter and the winter of 95/96.  We shall prepare for you the electricity price information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but you have to approach FT (the publishers of Megawatts Daily, a newsletter that produces the price index we recommend using)  and request the permision to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute this information.  Please, explain that this is for academic  research and that we can produce the time series for you, conditional on the permission from the publishers of Megawatts Daily.  Vince Kaminski

 Dear Mr. Ray,  I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.

 Andy,  Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating several high profile projects.  Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support internally from other members of the group: this contribution may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.  We appreciate your hands-on involvement. It's always the most important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent interaction with the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.  Vince

 Shirley,  Did we renew it?  Vince 
 Steve,  I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather negative: he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth and technical details.  He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive side.  Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after 18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.  Vince 
 Martin,  Can you prepare a draft of recommendation for  Eric? I can elaborate more and sign it.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Stinson is looking into it. I shall get back to you later today after I check with him.  Vince 
 Vasant,  It seems we have to help them. Can Kate help on this project?  Vince 
 Osman,  This guy is too much. I would tell him that we understand that he has to make the best choice for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed in Enron.  We never had any luck hiring a statistician. Maybe we shall get one some day.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, put it on my calendar.  Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Bill,  Lacima is relatively small, but they have two very competent and experienced principals: Chris Strickland and Les Clewlow.  I am looking right now at a number of options. Hopefully, I shall make a decision within a few weeks.  Vince 
 Rob,  The orgchart per your request. Did you follow up on my suggestion regarding the PC? My secretary can give you the serial number of the CPU and you can scan the hard drive for recently created/deleted files. IT guys took all the old PCs my group was using away.  Vince 
 Althea  Great news. It's all your hard work.  Vince 
 Iris,  Can you forward me the attachments to this message. I cannot open them.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Grant,  Tuesday or Wednesday would work.  Please, call me in the morning or at home tonight (281) 367 5377. Alternatively, we could have  breakfast.  Vince 
 Shirley,  FYI  Vince 
 Rakesh,  Looks fine.  Vince 
 Any recommendations. Please, let me know ASAP.  Vince 
 Aisha,  The person to contact is Christie Patrick who is in charge  our University Relations Office. Her E-mail address is:  christie_patrick@enron.com.  I shall forward your message to Ms. Patrick.  Vince 
 Christie,  I am forwarding you a message I have received from the University of Houston. Can you help them? We have a very good relationship with the UoH.  Vince 
 Iris,  We can mention to Ben that the papers will be edited and combined into a coherent review.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, register me for this.  Vince 
 Michele,  Friday morning would work better for me.  Vince 
 David,  I regret to inform you I am unable to attend the conference due to previous commitments. Would you consider a speakers form our London office?  Vince 
 Stinson,  He keeps bugging us about it. Any thoughts what we should do?  Vince 
 It's OK to delay the materials for Duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain.  Vince 
 Anne,  I have good business reasons to approve carryover in excess of 40 hours for Mike Roberts and his group. Shane Green is not in my group.  Vince 
 Vasant,  I gave my slot to Zimin.  We are organizing a group with RAC to send a few people to this conference at a discount to full cost.  Vince 
 Jim,  I shall be glad to talk to them.  Vince 
 I am teaching a class at Rice and one of my very bright students sent her resume in response to this posting. Do you know who posted this job?  Vince Kaminski 
 David,  I can ask our CEO John Sherriff. Please, let me know by 10:00 a.m. Central Time, Wednesday.  Vince 
 Pam,  Please, let me know how I can submit the grades. I gave my students April the 30th as a deadline to submit their reports and I shall be able to send you the grades by May the 4th.  Is E-mail OK?  Vince 
 Shirley,  I probably asked you about it already. I want to renew.  Vince 
 Helen,  FYI.  Vince 
 Michelle,  FYI  Vince 
 Steve,  I talked to Mike about taking you out to dinner sometimes next week. Let's close the loop on this on Friday.  Vince 
 Tom,  We are currently space constrained but we shall always take a qualified candidate. Please, ask George to send me a resume and we shall get in touch with him to arrange a phone/on-location interview.   Vince 
 Vasant,  Thanks. Let's contact Wharton next week.  Vince 
 Anita,  Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the stay. I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and Amitava, based on the business need.  One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.  Vince 
 Martin,  I can join the car pool.  Vince 
 Molly,  We can pay for the plane ticket. We have to make sure that we shall extend the same treatment to other summer interns to avoid bad feelings.  Vince 
 Sevil,  Please, make sure you provide this information ASAP.  Vince 
 Mike,  The later hour works perfectly for me.  Vince 
 Diane,  Thanks  Vince 
 Bessik,  I left a message for Michael. He is on vacation.  Vince 
 David,  I talked to JS. His PR person in London will contact you.  Vince 
 Steve, Not a bad move for NEM.  I got it at 17.5 when the option was exercised against me.  Vince 
 Steve,  That would be great.  Vince 
 Martin,  Works for me.  Vince  Shirley, Please, put on my schedule. 
 Osman,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Brian,  No problem.  Vince 
 Heather,  I am forwarding this message to 2 groups in Enron that may be interested.  Vince 
 Mike,  I am sending you a message regarding a potential candidate.   Please, take a look at him and see if he fits better our group or Mark Tawney's group.  Vince 
 Vasant  FYI  Vince 
 Glenn,  Please, contact Rudi Zipter to set up an interview with him and David Port.  Vince 
 Mark,  I left you a message regarding The National Forum on Corporate Finance at  Rice.  They would be delighted if you could serve as a panel  member at this conference.  Here are the coordinates of the professor at Rice who is in charge. I would appreciate if you could call him and let him know if you can attend.  Thanks.  Vince   Prof. David Ikenberry Jones Graduate School of Management Rice University 713-348-5385 
 Joe,  We are extremely pleased with the support we receive from your team. The problem was fixed very quickly.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Dennis,  Thanks for you message. I shall send you more information regarding the  dinner later this week. Christie Patrick, who is in charge of our university liaison unit, is making arrangements for the evening  at the Enron Field. Hopefully, we shall be able to combine dinner with a game.  Vince 
 Peter,  I forwarded your resume with my recommendation to two senior executives in our Transportation and Storage Group.  Vince 
 I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.  I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston.  The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.  Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.   Vince Kaminski

 Dale,  Please, call me on Tuesday. My morning schedule is full but I am open in the afternoon.  Vince 
 Jason,  Please, give me a call at 713 853 3848 and we can meet for coffee.  Vince 
 Iris,  Tom Gros is the person who can  help.  Vince 
 Anita,  Please, catch me tomorrow to talk about it.  Vince 
 Vasant,  What do you think?  He may be expensive.  Vince 
 Mike,  We are short manpower in London. We shall try to evaluate the software in Houston.  Vince 
 Aysu  Please, send the resume to me.  Vince 
 Dale,  I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that I can tell you at this point.  The commercial groups are still interested and are moving towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the product. As I have  said, we are not the decision makers in this case.  I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.  Vince 
 Frank,  Yes.  Vince 
 Dave,  Did you call Mark Koening?  He expected  your call as of Fri noon when he left a message on my voice mail.  Vince 
 What is the top grade at Rice: A?  Vince 
 Stinson,  Thanks  Vince 
 Shalesh,  A good idea.  I shall forward it to the AG traders.  Vince 
 Kim,  I talked to Dale early this morning and suggested that we meet during his next trip to Houston when we decide on timing of our project.  Vince 
 Please, put on my schedule.  Vince 
 Molly,  Kim Watson would like us to bring Jacob for another interview. We can do it later this week.  Vince    Vince 
 Vasant,  I agree.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Transmission is my 1st choice.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Jason,  Yes, I cannot open it.  Vince 
 Stuart,  I cannot open your attachment.  Vince Kaminski 
 Christie,  Shirley reserved room 49C1 for Monday 4:00 p.m.  presentation.  Can you  issue the formal invitation to our guests with the game/dinner details? I don't have all the details regarding the Enron Field box and time. I am out most of the day on Wednesday but we can discuss the details on Thursday.  Hope to see you on Saturday at  the concert.   Vince 
 Pam,  The term papers arrived at my Internet mailbox. I shall be sending you the information as I make progress reading the papers.  First group of students:  Helen Demianenko Javier Lamas Lynn Nazareth Shauywn Smith Carlos Wheelock Sarah Woody  Grade: A   Please, confirm receipt of this message and please double check that all registered students have been graded (to make sure no student falls through the cracks).   Vince 
 Michelle,  The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker, 5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.  I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable time.  Vince 
 Phillip,  How can I install new programs on my laptop, without the administrator's privileges?  One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow me to install it.  Also, I have my private statistical software I often use when I work at night during business trips. I would like to load it as well.  Vince 
 Stuart,  I have difficulties opening the attachment. Please, resend as a  .doc file  or  a   .pdf file.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, arrange a phone interview with Richard. Stinson, myself, Vasant.  Vince 
 Kristin,  Thanks a lot for the resume. We shall arrange a phone interview with Richard. This is out standard procedure. A phone interview is  followed by the on-site interview, after we determine what is the best team to interview the candidate.   Vince 
 Stinson,  A request for help. I have quite a few letters of recommendation to write today and it's not going to be an easy day.  Can you help me with this letter for Shalesh? The job description is attached.  Vince 
 Jinbaek,  Thanks for your message.  We have a number of additional  fascinating projects that you can work on.  As a matter of fact, it would be great to have you here earlier.  Vince 
 CALENDAR ENTRY:	INVITATION  Description: Cuthbert Roberts - Vince's office - EB1962  Date:		5/3/2001 Time:		11:00 AM - 11:30 AM (Central Standard Time)  Chairperson:	Vince J Kaminski  Detailed Description: 
 Philip,  Thanks. You are the best.  Vince 
 Tani,  Yes, I am aware of it. Thanks for letting me know who is the HR Rep in London.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, set up a meeting with me, Nelson and Vasant.  Vince 
 Layla,  A few points.  I shall be glad to attend the reception.  I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay. I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my presentation (or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and Power 1999): the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.  My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the presentation and I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the credit when the credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?  Vince 
 Dorothy,  No problem. Please, CC-mail  me Tom's number. One of the members of the group has a PhD in computer science and he will join me for the call.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, make sure that I follow up on this.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, put it on my schedule.  Vince 
 Layla,  My associate's  name is Tanya Tamarchenko. The E-mail address is:  tanya.tamarchenko@enron.com.  Location is the same as mine, Enron, 1400 Smith, Houston.  Thanks  Vince   P.S.  Shirley, please send my bio to Layla 
 Gwyn,  Yes, please  go ahead and get a resume book from SAIS.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please schedule an interview with Konstantin on May 8.  Stinson, Zimin, Alex, Tanya, Krishna, myself.   Vince 
 Stinson,  Let's talk about it. It seems like an open personality clash developing for the first time in the history of the group.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Gwyn,  Try to reduce the number of potential candidates to 3, before I shall get involved.  Also, I contacted HR regarding your promotion. The process has started.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, renew my membership.  Vince 
 Pam,  Another team:  Elena Chilkina Robert J. Guadette Joseph Helms Kenneth Jett Todd Litton MarK Westmoreland   Grade:  A-   Vince Kaminski 
 Jinbaek,  This is a project related to automated trading platforms for commodities.  Vince 
 Vasant,  When can we call this guy?  Vince 
 Ken  Thanks for baby-sitting this.  Vince

 Pam,  Another group:  Stuart Hamel Jed Howard Brian Nelson    B+    Vince 
 A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.  He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support of other members of my group with skills in different areas.  Vince Kaminski

 Shirley,  I shall come. I shall bring a cake. I may be late, coming around 2:00. I expect some people who will come to give me an estimate and they come when they come.   Vince 
 John,  Thanks. I got it.  Vince 
 Pam,  Another term paper:   John Ganguzza Neeraj Hingorani Grant Johnson Duane Maue Rishad Patel Eric van Stone Palo Yoshiuro   Grade:  A  Please, confirm.   Vince 
 Pam,  The last group. Please, let me know if any name is missing.     Grade: A    Thanks a lot. It was a pleasure working with you.  Vince Kaminski 
 Lance,  I could not open the attachment. I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project and limit intern's access to additional information.  Vince 
 Sam,  Yes, I will contribute.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Can you please take a quick look and fwd it to Sam Smith (wsmith2@enron.com)  Vince 
 Any interest in this conference?   http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/   Vince 
 Jinbaek,  May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.  I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short notice.  When you come here you can determine in what area he could make the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail him independently and talk to him.  Vince 
 Anurag,  No message attached.  Nice to hear from you again.  Vince 
 Anurag,  I shall talk about Vikas to our IT people. Can you send me his resume?  Vince 
 Andreas,  My private E-mail address is vkaminski@aol.com My phone number is 713 410 5396 (cell) (281) 367 5377 (home).  Vince 
 Francesca,  It was nice meeting you in San Antonio. An article from FT on IPOs in case you missed it.   Vince Kaminski 
 David,  Sounds like a safe bet.  Vince 
 Larry,  I was thinking about the potential applications over the weekend and I think I shall have a proposal for you in a few days.  Vince  P.S. I want to remind you about the favor I asked you about. We would like to talk (no commitments) to the Prediction Company. Can you refer me to your friend.  Vince 
 Ken,  Please, watch out.  Vince 
 Ron,  The resume of the Rice student I mentioned to you.  Vince 
 This is a resume of one guy I met in Houston a few months ago. He comes across as a very bright and  qualified individual. He is interested in a position in London. Who is the best person in London to forward the resume to?  Vince 
 Shirley  Another letter for Chonawee.  Vince 
 Thanks.  Vince 
 Paula,  Do u want to go out and eat one day on weekend?  Vince 
  Krishna,  Should you go and Youyi go?  Vince 
 John,  Sounds interesting. I shall put July 27th on my calendar.   Vince 
 Paula,  No, I drove.  Vince 
 Joseph,  It was a p
