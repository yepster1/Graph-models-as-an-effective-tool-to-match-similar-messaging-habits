 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 Celeste,  I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but I cannot find a copy in my msg folder. There might have been a glitch in the CC-mail and the message did not go through and wasn't  stored.  I wanted to make the following points:  1. Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com business and wants to pursue this opportunity.  2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad or a stipend refund check should show up on March 15.  3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his future employment opportunities with Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs. If he decides to re-apply at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him entrepreneurial plans against him.  Please, let me  know what you think.  Vince 
 Ravi,  The proposed dates work for me.  Vince 
 Ravi,  It's fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it's equal to the cost of the alternative).  Vince 
 Celeste,  We shall match the tuition cost. We are very anxious to have Gappy here at Enron supporting EBS.  Vince 
 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 Paige,  In this case I shall ask Stinson and Zimin to talk to you next week.  I am going to prepare and send you an  outline of a document we can produce on defining and testing hedging effectiveness.  Vince 
 Thanks for the message. I am traveling on the days when you offer the class. Please, keep me in mind.  Vince

 Jana,  Thanks again for the invitation to join you at the Rodeo. It was a great pleasure to meet you and your husband.  What   about getting together next week for a movie and/or dinner? I shall call you later this week to find out when you are free. I have a trip to NYC on Tuesday and Wednesday, but Thursday or Friday should be fine.  I have  a speaking engagement on April 6 in Florida (a conference organized by Florida Power and Light). This means I shall miss the meeting of the Symphony Partners on that day.

 David,  I sent a message with information to several different units but no response so far. I think people need a specific need to focus and I shall keep the Chicago Partners in mind when a relevant project arrives. I shall resend the message with attachments on CP in a few weeks as a reminder.   Vince  Vince 
 Shirley,  Can you schedule an interview for him with Stinson, Zimin and Krishna.  Vince 
 Nurit,  We shall schedule a phone interview for you sometimes next week. My assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713 853 5290), will call you to discuss the timing.  Vince Kaminski

 Nick,  Thanks for your message. Saturday, 11:45 at  the Terman is fine with me. See you there.  Vince 
 Elizabeth,  FYI  Vince 
 Bryan,  I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could accomplish this from Houston, but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip to London makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get more information about the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business. Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to assess better the usefulness of the model.  Vince 
 Grant,  Your call. Any day would work for me.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Should we get him as well? It seems he has the right skills. We might have maxed out on the number of summer interns through the A/A program. We would have to hire him directly.    Vince

 Shirley,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Karen,  I have forwarded all the resumes to Charlene Jackson about 10 days ago. I am resending 4 resumes (in the case of Paolo it's a copy of his E-mail message) I have in electronic format. The resume for Gappy will be faxed to you.  Thanks for your help.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Pleae, invite Clayton.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Do we still have some copies left?  Vince 
 Gary, Peter,  This is a copy of my London presentation. I expect to make some minor changes to this presentation for March 13.  Vince    Vince Kaminski 
 Ken,  It seems that there may be an Internet bias as well (more affluent and educated households are on-line).  One solution: develop a control group. Arm-twist clerical employees of the School to fill out the questionnaire and also ask them to provide the questionnaire to their friends  and families.  Vince

 Charlene, I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer interns. I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.  In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.  Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.  Vince 
 Drogi Panie Andrzeju,  Probuje skontaktowac sie z Jarkiem Astramowiczem, by znalezc sposob dofinansowania Waszej imprezy. Jedyna mozliwosc, by to zrobic jest poprzez Enron Poland. Mnie byloby bardzo trudno usprawiedliwic to z mojego budzetu.  W. Kaminski 
 Ravi,  Our compensation for summer interns is very generous. It's more than what an engineering student expects.  Vince  P.S.  Any progress on the resumes in electronic form? I want to send a package to Charlene today.  Vince

 Shirley  FYI  Vince 
 Thanks.  Vince 
 Mike,  There might be a place for Steve in our unit supporting EES. I shall forward the resume to my associates supporting the Facility Management effort.  Thanks for thinking about us.  Vince  P.S.

 Jennifer,  Yes, we shall look at him. Thanks for thinking of us.  Vince      Enron North America Corp. 
 To all whom it may concern:  I would like to register my associate Zimin Lu as my guest at Power 2000 conference in Houston in May. Thanks.  Vince Kaminski 
 Mike,  This one is very good. I am afraid we shall have a few employees left after this test.  Vince 
 Margaret,  I have an economist in my group and asked her if she feels qualified to make a presentation on this topic. I shall keep you posted. I think It would help Enron to oblige.  Vince 
 Maureen,  Could you make a presentation on this topic? It would be a favor to our operation in Nebraska and it's not mandatory.   Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Osman,  Can you help him. I think his company's profile is in your territory.  Vince 
 Bill,  I forwarded your message to my associate, Osman Sezgen, who supports our Energy Services group. He will E-mail you the name of a contact at Enron.  Vince Kaminski 
 Zimin,  You are the 1st. Feel free to register as my guest.  Vince 
 Grant,  Did Li Xiao refer Alex  to us?  Vince 
 Gwyn,  Try to reduce the number of potential candidates to 3, before I shall get involved.  Also, I contacted HR regarding your promotion. The process has started.  Vince 
 Krishna,  We should invite Kim Watson and her associates as well.  Vince 
 Lynn,  I am forwarding you the resume of a very bright and motivated young man who attended a lecture I gave recently at LSU.  I think we should consider him for an analyst position.  Vince

 Celeste,  I would like to ask you for a favor. We would like to have Sevil as an intern in our group this summer.

I shall send you the resumes in separate messages.  Vince Kaminski 
 Shirley,  Please, register me.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, forward my bio to Crystal.  Vince 
 Louise,  Some time ago I sent you a message regarding Ed Krapels. He is writing a book on energy commodity markets and would like to learn more about EOL.  Can you give him a  call and chat with him for 10 minutes. He is a good friend of Enron and it would be free ad for us.  Vince 
 Bill,  I am forwarding a memo from Vincent Tang about the new credit model. English may be imperfect but the message is clear.  Vince

 Steve,  We can accelerate the process. We need some internal approvals. Please, talk to Richard Lewis and  let him know I think it's OK to publish it because it is a very high level theoretical paper.  Vince 
 I have received an inquiry through one of our employees (David Barr) from Chicago Partners, a consulting firm in Chicago. They specialize, among other things, in regulatory economics and could be useful as experts in our discussions with the government and regulatory agencies.  One of the partners, Christopher Culp, is a well known commodity markets expert.  Please, let me know if you are interested.  Vince Kaminski 
 Larry,  I sent the information to Mark Ruane, 713 853 3569. He is the best customer at Enron for real options applications.  Vince 
 Mark,  We are too busy. We shall skip it.  Vince 
 Barbara,  Yes, ECT does not exist any longer. It's safer to say the seminar is sponsored buy Enron Corp. WE have a reorganization every three months.  Vince 
 Ian,  Sorry for a delay in responding to you. I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow.  The problem is not  with the lawyers. We worked on our presentation materials together with a professor from another university and we agreed to use these materials only internally.  We have to honor our commitment to him. I am sure that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had made a similar commitment to you.  Vince

 Shirley,  Can you please set up the meeting.  Vince 
 Chris,  No problem. Feel free to mention our names.  Vince

 Mike,  Please, stay on top of this development.  Vince 
 FYI,  Please, take a look at this resume.  Vince 
 Mark,  I agree with you. They do not seem to have the market penetration we need. The benefits don't justify the expense.  I shall notify them.  Vince

 Rick & Ted,  One more thing to watch. California power prices next  summer. We see the possibility of higher prices and of spikes (bad hydro conditions in California, growing demand for power).  Vince 
 Mark,  I have an inquiry from a publishing house who are preparing a book on the world power markets. They wanted us to sponsor it (at the cost of 19,000 pounds) but the reaction from our power desks was  lukewarm.  They are offering us an opportunity to advertise in this publocatio.

 George,  This is the first cut at the problem you gave us, done by my associate Clayton Vernon. Please, feel free to call him with any question. Your friend should check what were the sermons he gave on April 19 and April 25, in 1998 and 1999, respectively.  Vince 
 Vince Kaminski EB1962 3-3848    Enron North America Corp. 
 Shelley,  My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a short summary of arguments against the ROFR.  We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences: he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific; so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.  Vince Kaminski 
 Lou,  Thanks a lot.  Vince 
 Fati,  Please contact Krishnarao Pinnamaneni or Osman Sezgen.  Vince

 This person might qualify for the Enterprise-Wide  Risk Management effort.  Vince 
 Ed,  I sent a message to Louise Kitchen who runs the EnronOnline effort. She should be getting back to you shortly.  Vince

 Shirley,  Works for me.  Vince 
 Anjam,  It's a very good job description.  Vince 
 Rick,  I read your memo regarding Global Risk Management Initiative.  I am sending you the information regarding a related initiative on which I have been working last year and which is moving now into the implementation stage. It's Enterprise - Wide Risk Management and it's really an effort to measure business risks consistently across the company.

 Jim,  I can send you copies of the  reprints of some papers I wrote or co-authored. Please, let me know how many copies do you need.  I shall prepare power point presentations for the student meeting and for the faculty meeting.  For the students: review of my group (things we work on) with an intention of generating some interest among the students and soliciting resumes.  For the faculty meeting: challenges that energy markets pose to financial modeling. I shall be able to E-mail the Power Point presentations later this month.  Vince 
 Ted, please take a quick look at the outline of discussion notes for Friday.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Any conflict?  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Clayton,  I agree. This would happen when there is an insufficient pipeline capacity to move gas. The market developments you describe happen quite often and this is one of the reasons we want to have the model you are working on.  Vince  Vince

 Ron,  I am sorry to inform you that due to a scheduling conflict I cannot speak at this conference. I want to thank you for considering me as a speaker.  Vince Kaminski 
 Stinson,  Let's talk about it. It seems like an open personality clash developing for the first time in the history of the group.  Vince 
 Greg,  Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.  1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson. Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old shoulders.  One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is between maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks.  2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of using the skills of Tony Mends. Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very smart and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that relies on processing huge volumes of information.  Vince 
 To whom? 
 Shirley,  Please,  put a regular Enron NA meeeting on Mondays at 9:30 to 11:00.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, ask me about it.  Vince

 Greg, Liz,  Here are the instructions how to get to Stinson's house.   Directions from major freeways:  From Southwest Freeway (59): Exit on Buffalo Speedway and go south.  (Greenway plaza is on the north side of the freeway.) Pass through stoplights on Bissonette, Sunset, Rice, and University. Turn right on Cason  (the last small street before the next stoplight, which is at Holcomb Blvd.) House is on your left in 2.5 blocks.   From  West Loop 610 : Exit on Bellaire Blvd. and go east  (inside the loop). After you pass the stoplights at Auden and at Edloe street,  start watching for JiffyLube on your right. When you near JiffyLube, turn LEFT onto Sewanee Street. At first intersection, turn Right onto Cason House is on your right.  If you miss the turn at JiffyLube, just turn LEFT at the stoplight at Buffalo and turn left again onto Cason.  Vince 
 Molly,  Stinson Gibner is the best person to interview Mark.  Vince 
 Celeste,  I am recommending Jason Sokolov for summer internship with Enron. Jason is currently working part-time for Mike Roberts and makes very valuable contribution  to a number on-going projects.  We are very happy with his performance and see him as a valuable future Enron employee.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, extend the invitation  to Greg and Liz.  Vince 
 Gary,  I shall stop by in the afternoon. Such a hurricane would bankrupt a few insurance companies.   Vince

 Kevin,  Please, talk to Jeff Shankman's secretary about including all the Research Group members on the 31st floor  in the company provided lunches (when they are available).  If an additional  lunch is needed from time to time, it's fine, but it should be seen as a something done under exceptional circumstances.   Vince 
 Shannon,  Thanks. The same to you.  Sorry to have missed your class. I had a very bad case of flu with some additional complications. I shall be glad to make a presentation on the same topic on another occasion.  Vince

 Bhavna,  Thanks a lot. The same to you. Happy Holidays.  Vince 
 Joe,  He is a research assistant of Prof. Darrell Duffie from Stanford and I met him in this capacity. A very bright fellow.  I could not assess his commercial skills but he has enough common sense to identify the winner (as his interest in Enron demonstrates).  Vince 
 Mark,  FYI. Any decisions regarding our involvement with John?  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Ron,  No message was attached.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, put it on my schedule.  Vince 
 Joe,  I am forwarding you the information about the student from Stanford of Japanese ancestry interested in Enron.  He lives currently  in California.  Vince Kaminski

 Stinson,  Can you attend?  Vince 
 Emma,  It's your choice. I can chair the session of day 2 or speak on one of these topics. Please, let me know what works for you.

 Shirley,  Business, like Ehud Ronn's visit.  Vince 
 Shijie,  Thanks for your message. My assistant will call you to discuss the timing of the visit.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Can you, please, call him and ask what would be best timing. The last week of July would be best. I would like Grant, Alex, Zimin, Krishna and Stinson to meet him.  Vince 
 Mark, Mike,  I have scheduled a video conference with this gentleman on Thursday this week at 3:30 p.m.  Can you join me for this conversation?  Vince 
 David,  I think we should follow the developments and adjust our processes to avoid legal exposures. I heard that Microsoft was hit with a $5 billion suit related to alleged discrimination through the rankin= g=20 process.  Vince 
 David,  I could not open the file. Please, resend. It may be the fire wall  issue or it's a different version of MS  Word.  Vince    Vince 
 Paige,  Thanks a lot for  your presentation. It was an eye-opener in many cases.  I shall schedule a meeting with you next week to discuss how we can help you  in this project. I have some ideas I would like to run by you.  Vince   P.S. Shirley, please see if Monday is OK for 30 mins?

 Barbara,  Sorry to have missed the dinner. I had to work on Sunday to prepare for my trip to London this week. I called Jeff about it and he said that he would let you know.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, forward tot he group.  Vince 
 Nick,  My trip to Stanford is on. I shall be glad to meet on Thursday for dinner. You can reach me at my cell phone (713 410 5396) and at vkaminski@aol.com.  Vince

 Dear Professor Huntington,  Thursday 10 a.m. works for me. Please, let me know where I can meet you.  I am attaching my itinerary, so that you can contact me if necessary . My cell phone number is 713 410 5396.  Vince Kaminski 
 Gwyn,  Yes, please  go ahead and get a resume book from SAIS.  Vince 
 Norma,  I would like to proceed on two fronts with Sevile (both H1 visa and the Green Card. I shall rather work hard to keep my employees happy here than try to attach them to the job through immigration arrangements. They can see through such arrangements and it de-motivates them.  Vince 
 Jeff,  I fully support Sandeep's request to move Anshuman Srivastav to Houston. I anticipate that we shall be working on Dhabol related issues for the next two years until all the business problems are successfully resolved.  Anshuman is a very capable employee, with the right combination of skills to attack the Dhabol modeling challenge. He understands the Indian markets as well as international fuel markets. He has also a very good grasp of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the Dhabol power plant.  Vince 
 Marshall,  A number of my associates. The names are to be determined.  Vince 
 Marshall,  We shall call him on Wednesday after 2:30.  Vince 
 Giuseppe  The dinner is scheduled, as I have mentioned, to you at 7:00 p.m. Wednesday at Il Fornaio, Canaletto Room.  Both you and Eric are welcome to join us.  Vince 
 I encourage everybody very strongly to join other Enron employees at this event. It's a great opportunity to contribute to the growth of our city and to make sure that Enron is not embarrassed  if other energy companies show up in strength.  Vince 
 Celeste,  We shall be happy to take him as an intern (summer asociate).  Vince 
 Valery,  Thanks for the invitation. What is the time frame? I shall be traveling extensively in  March.  Vince 
 Dave,  Thanks. I shall join you there.  Vince 
 steve,  Do you see an intraday bottom?  Vince 
 Sam,  Minor corrections.    Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks for contacting me about this. As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.  I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus 10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager. Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).   On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron. Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge. Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.  Vince 
 Sam,  Looks fine. I amy have a few small changes on Monday.  Vince    Enron North America Corp. 
 Anita,  Done.  Vince 
 Rebecca,  I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud. He is retired and he chose to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment). I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I did not meet him and could not form my judgment based on personal observations.  However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey to you and not to act upon.  Vince Kaminski 
 Zimin,  It did not work (start/programs/infobase/fea 2.0.). It looks for a file on my C: drive.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Yes.  Vince 
 Norma,  Any progress on the Green Card for Sevile?  Vince 
 Layla,  My associate's  name is Tanya Tamarchenko. The E-mail address is:  tanya.tamarchenko@enron.com.  Location is the same as mine, Enron, 1400 Smith, Houston.  Thanks  Vince   P.S.  Shirley, please send my bio to Layla 
 Vasant,  Yes, it's perfect. Please, indicate that the wording was unfortunate.  Vince 
 Shirley,  It's an IT request for Sandeep. Please, help.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Greg,  This is the agenda for the recruiting trip to Stanford next week.  Vince 
 Hari,  Thanks. Please, keep me posted about your progress. Any published papers?  We shall send you the printout.  Vince 
 Ian,  Sorry for a delay in getting back to you. I have one challenge I did not anticipate when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options internal seminar.  The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the materials outside Enron.  Please, give me some time to find out if I can work around this issue.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, register me  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, invite Jacob  for an exploratory interciew.  VK, SG, ZL, KP, BL, TT, CS, TH  Vince 
 Adam,  We shall  invite you for an exploratory interview.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, put it on my schedule.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Pam,  Thanks,  Yes, I need the E-mail addresses as well.  Vince 
 Anita,  Remind me to mobilize the group tomorrow for the occasion.  Vince 
 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 Sheila,  There were some handwritten changes made by Greg Whalley on the draft.. I am sending you a copy  in a few minutes.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Should we make arrangements for lunch? What about inviting Brad Romine: he was instrumental in forming this relationship?  Vince  Shirley, please include on my calendar. 
 Shirley,  Please, make sure that I follow up on this.  Vince 
 Yannis,  I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and find that practically all the topics of the program are the staple of what we do every day. I don't think Research  should spend money for this class.  If we want to establish a relationship, we can easily do it by asking him to work on a research project.  Vince 
 Sheila,  Some minor differences between the draft and the final executed version. I have forgotten to bring the draft today, I shall send  a copy to you tomorrow. There were some hand-written changes made by Greg ijn the draft that were not transferred to the final version.  Vince 
 Christie, Karen and Mike,  This is info about Texas Finance Festival,  a great opportunity to establish closer ties with Texas business schools. You can contact John directly if you are interested in attending.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Am I registered?  Vince 
 Rehman,  Thanks for you message. My group hires almost exclusively people with background in quantitative disciplines (math, physics) or computer programming.  I shall send your resume to some other units in the company that are looking for people with good skills and experience.  Vince 
 Zimin, Stinson  I think I forwarded the message to you. Did we act on it?  Vince 
 Vincent,  Sorry for a delay in responding to your message. I shall be very glad to write a letter of recommendation. Please, send me the forms.  I hope you are doing OK.  Vince 
 Laura,  We shall have phone interviews with both candidates you brought up to our attention.  Vince 
 Dorothy,  No problem. Please, CC-mail  me Tom's number. One of the members of the group has a PhD in computer science and he will join me for the call.  Vince 
 Duane,  Sorry for the delay in responding to you. I shall get back to you in a day or so.  Vince 
 Zimin,  It seems that the academia is catching up. Do you have a realistic case we can show them? Something generic.  Vince 
 Hari,  I shall send you a reprint of the  article. I had to cancel my presentation at San Antonio.  Vince  Shirley,  Please, send a copy of the article to Hari. 
 Shirley  yes.  Vince 
 Moyez,  I could not access the system.  Vince Kaminski 
 Iris,  I think that your badge has  not been activated for the access to the floor after 7 p.m. or the weekends.  We shall take care of it.  Vince 
 Layla,  A few points.  I shall be glad to attend the reception.  I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay. I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my presentation (or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and Power 1999): the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.  My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the presentation and I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the credit when the credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?  Vince 
 Shirley,  Do you know about it?  Vince 
 Kim,  Yes, the offer is coming. It may take a few days to process it, but you can count on it.  Vince 
 Sam,  Here it is.  Vince       Enron North America Corp. 
 Steve,  Welcome back. Let's have coffee ASAP and review all the projects under way.  Vince 
 Jinbaek,  This is fine though you are welcome to spend more time with us this summer.  Vince 
 Barbara,  I will be glad to join you.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, set up a meeting with me, Nelson and Vasant.  Vince 
 Mike  Take a look at this  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/newshour_index.html#  and go to Paul Solman's report on gas prices. There is a video capsule of El Paso weather report.  Vince 
 Jinbaek,  You can coordinate the details with me. Let me know what the time frame is for you and we shall send you an appropriate offer.  Vince 
 Hello,  Sorry for a delay in getting back to you. We would like very much to offer you a summer internship.  Please, let me know if you are interested.  Vince Kaminski 
 Barbara,  I called Vlady Gorny and explained that the presentation by Jorion is not offered under the umbrella of the  seminar sponsored by Enron and that it is a closed meeting for the School faculty.  I don't think that Enron would open its job interviews to Rice observers who expressed interest and I made this comment to Vlady. He is OK with this.  You can let his program director know that I have explained   to Vlady that it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be invited.   Please, let me know the details of the dinners.  Vince 
 Ken,  Please, watch out.  Vince 
 Donna,  FYI  Vince 
 Hi Steve,  I shall call you Friday morning my time.  Vince 
 Hello David,  Coffee early next week would work for me.  Vince 
 Hi Paula,  A friend of mine comes from New York (an interview with Enron on Monday) and he will stay with me on Sunday.  What about a dinner at the bistro?  Vince 
 Vin,  The E-mail address of the person who can help you with a job at San Fran, a brokerage business.   Dad 
 Tani,  Yes, I am aware of it. Thanks for letting me know who is the HR Rep in London.  Vince 
 Bernard,  Yes, I can  read a DVI file. You can also  cc my home address: Vkaminski@aol.com. I shall try to send you an answer to your question on weekend.  Vince 
 Celeste,  I have just talked to Kim. I told her she will receive one.  Vince 
 Celeste,  It seems that the process lasted too long for some students and only Kim Whitsel is interested in the internship at this point.  Her resume has been forwarded to you. I am enclosing it just in case. Thanks for your help.  Vince 
 Bernard,  It seems the msg has been truncated.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Yes, I think I am free. Please, set it up.  Vince 
 Pani Grazyno,  Dziekuje bardzo za wiadomosc. Autor ksiazki przeslal mi egzemplarz. Na pewno skorzystam z okazji, by kupic inne ksiazki Pani wydawnictwa. Any web-site I can access?  W. Kaminski 
 Bernard,  I am forwarding your message to my assistant and she will mail you a reprint. I would be glad to take a look at your dissertation. Is it available as a publication, working paper?  Vince 
 Jack,  This is up to the MBA program. I have no problem if they agreed to it. The only constraint is the space and we shall have to address the issue on Thursday during the first class.  Vince 
 Dennis,  No problem.  Vince 
 Philip,  Thanks. You are the best.  Vince 
 Elena,  Can you, please, help wiht this request?  Kevin,  Please, call me if Elena is not in the office on Wednesday.   Vince 
 Anita,  We have to push Steve's presentation  one week forward. Rick Jones will be completing his presentation.  Vince 
 Julie,  Thanks for the invitation.  Tuesday would work better for me. I came back from California this morning and I am quite exhausted.  What is the number at which I can reach you?  Vince 
 Marek,  Zadzwonie do Ciebie, zeby sie umowic na spotkanie.  Wicek 
 Molly,  Thanks a lot.  Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 Andy,  Thanks. I shall forward  your message to Prof. Ikenberry.  Vince 
 I am sending you the slides from our presentation for Dave Delainey. Please, update the slides, to account for the reorg and growth of the group. I shall represent Maureen.  Please, make decisions about involving additional people in this project.  Vince 
 Andy,  Thanks. I cannot open the file. Is it a Word document?  Vince 
 Anita,  Good decision.  Vince 
 Konstantin,  No problem, as long as the MBA program agrees to it. I need an E-mail from them.  Vince 
 Jinbaek,  Thanks for your message.  We have a number of additional  fascinating projects that you can work on.  As a matter of fact, it would be great to have you here earlier.  Vince 
 Gary,  I got your message.  The best way to proceed is to establish direct communication between you and Julie and negotiate a deal.  Vince 
 Julie,  No answer  yet.  Vince 
 Kristin,  Thanks a lot for the resume. We shall arrange a phone interview with Richard. This is out standard procedure. A phone interview is  followed by the on-site interview, after we determine what is the best team to interview the candidate.   Vince 
 Judy,  Sorry, I cannot help you on this one.  I already cover a number of campuses.   Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Molly,  Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for a  trading position. Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman, Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.  I talked to him in New York and he is considering other opportunities, so we have to act fast. I think John will like him more than Punit.    Thanks

 Stuart,  I have difficulties opening the attachment. Please, resend as a  .doc file  or  a   .pdf file.  Vince 
 Chaim,  I received a number of phone messages from you. The project is now in the hands of John and I shall be very happy to assist him when he is ready to move. He is looking at the licensing agreement right now.  Till then, I have to wait for him to make  a decision. My role in this project is one of a facilitator, technical consultant.  Vince 
 Jeff,  I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip). I think the organization is very interested in him.  I don't know what  "illicts your attention" means.  Vince 
 Rachel,  I would like very much to interview Howard but I am in Philadelphia on Tuesday.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Celeste,  Thanks a lot. Please, let us know whom you are willing to take based on the campus interviews, and I shall absorb the overflow. My experience with the Teams 1 & 3 is that they are outstanding students and we shall be able to offer them a fulfilling summer internship.  Last year we took 8 summer interns into research and all of them very happy with the program.  Vince 
 Phillip,  How can I install new programs on my laptop, without the administrator's privileges?  One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow me to install it.  Also, I have my private statistical software I often use when I work at night during business trips. I would like to load it as well.  Vince 
 Mark,  Thanks. Vince 
 Christie,  Meeting at 5:30 is fine with me. The presentation is at  6:30. I sent you a message regarding a dinner on Tuesday. Can  you join me and Ken Parkhill?  Vince 
 Al,  I left message on Mark's voice mail with the question about his interest in your idea.  Vince 
 Christie,  Look fwd to the trip.  Shirley is sending you my itinerary. When are you flying back? What about a dinner on Tuesday?  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Ken  Thanks  Vince 
 Stinson,  No problem.  Vince 
 Kristin,  The problem with this guy is that we maxed out on the number of interns we can gainfully employ and provide adequate supervision. So, we have to pass on him.   Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 Michelle,  The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker, 5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.  I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable time.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Julie,  Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel. Also, I think that one day makes more sense.  I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good discount.  Vince 
 Mark,  Any further thoughts on the blood bank concept? Please, let  me know if I can be helpful?  Vince 
 John,  Did you have a chance to take a look at his presentation?  Any comments?  Vince 
 Sandeep,  Please,  help Margaret with L1 for Anshuman.  Vince 
 Please, put on my calendar  Vince 
 John,  I think it's a good idea. Please, go ahead and call him directly.  Vince 
 Julie,  That's definitely an option.  We can provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal for Enron and increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding your message to our weather desk.  Vince  Joe,  What do you think about it?  Vince

Vince 
 Joe,  I shall probably ask Tanya to attend. It coincides with Parents' Weekend at Stanford. Please, send me the slides anyway.  I shall help Tanya to prepare her presentation.  Vince 
 Steve,  I sold EFS. I think insurance stocks are going up on the hopes of further interest rates cuts.  We bought 100 books.  Yes, please, send me the copy of an article.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Christie,  Shirley reserved room 49C1 for Monday 4:00 p.m.  presentation.  Can you  issue the formal invitation to our guests with the game/dinner details?

 Stinson,  Let's talk about it at the meeting.  Vince 
 Jeff,  Thanks. We shall try to arrange a video conference with Houston when Howard is back.  Vince

 FYI  Vince 
 Andy,  I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top finance practitioners and academics. The idea came from a professor at Rice University who has already received a commitment from a number of most distinguished CFOs.

 John.  I want to ask you for a favor. Can you help this fellow (who is negotiating a contract with John Wiley by giving him some advice?  Vince 
 Steve,  Thanks. I printed the fundamental info last night and will wait for the open.  I negotiated a few contracts for  Enron's contribution to a book (Enron was a sponsor).  It's not the same as negotiating as an author.  You can call a friend of mine, John Martin, and he will be able to help you.  Vince  John D. Martin Carr P.

 Please, put on my schedule.  Vince 
 Steve,  I am glad you feel better.  Please, let Debbie know that she should not hesitate to call on me or Paula (or the rest of he Woodlands crowd if she needs help).   Vince 
 Julie,  There are many employees in London  who would be interested. You can send  an inquiry to Steve Leppard.  I had a presentation last night to GARP in Houston and did a commercial for the book. You should put me on commission.  Vince

 Jeff,  Correction. Tom Costantino's  phone number:  Phone: (713) 680 8687 (h)  My previous message had a typo.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, send Johan (address below) the info how to get to the building.   Vince 
 Shalesh,  A good idea.  I shall forward it to the AG traders.  Vince 
 Jason,  You should know what these terms mean.  Let's get both.  Vince 
 Jeff,  It seems that NYMEX will not make a decision any time soon or they rejected Tom. I think the latter is the case.  Tom is looking for a trading or origination job with Enron. I think that we can use his expertise here.  Vince 
 Geoff,  You have very beautiful daughters. You must be a very proud father.  I shall try to attend a few sessions of the CERA conference. You can also call me when you are in Houston and we can meet for dinner and/or drinks.  Vince 
 Jeff,  My associates  are leaving for London tonight (Monday). They can still interview Howard on Tuesday afternoon.  Vince 
 Giselle,   Thanks. We want to send him flowers.  Please, let me know when he is transferred to a regular room: I don't think he can receive flower at the ICU.  Vince 
 Jeff, Greg and John,  Our old friend Tom Costantino is interested in coming back to Enron. It seems that his move to NYMEX either will not happen or will not happen for some time.  You can contact him at home:  Phone: (713) 860 8687 (h)  Vince

 Mike,  Following request has been made for a number of people.  The access requested is: o:\research\power meteorology\weather temperatures - Read/Write Data Approval  Grant  This is what I wrote, denying the request:  The reason for the rejection has been communicated  several times. The person who requested the access does not want it any more.  Granting both read/write access could threaten the integrity of the data.   Any comments?  Vince 
 Clayton,  No problem. I asked Shirley to reschedule.  Vince      Clayton Vernon @ ENRON 01/29/2001 12:38 AM 
 Shirley,  Please, rescheduule.  Vince 
 Julie,  We received the shipment of 50 books. Thanks.  The book was an instant hit. We need 50 more books.  Vince  P.S. I understand Paul sent you the check for the remaining 50%

 Johan,  Please, confirm the interview on Thursday next week, 1-5.  Vince 
 Dave,  Did you call Mark Koening?  He expected  your call as of Fri noon when he left a message on my voice mail.  Vince 
 Rabi,  You and Tanya  should go ahead with the course you have already registered for. I have just mentioned it  FYI.  I don't see too many problems  with the  course Stinson may help to arrange. The alternative course can be scheduled on premises, late in the day and distributed over longer  time period.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Makes perfect sense. Per head cost is much lower. We shall have enough candidates.  Vince 
 Pam  Thanks  Yes, please, send me the E-mail addresses.  Vince

 Kevin.  Thanks.  I am working on the distribution list and the cover letters.  Vince 
 Al,  Thanks for the update. I hope that you and Mark will come up with a good plan of attack.  I can only regret that my workload does not allow me to participate in this project.   Vince 
 Rachel,  Vasant Shanbhogue and Tanya Tamarchenko from my group will be in London next week. They can meet Howard.  Vince 
 Frank,  Yes.  Vince 
 Sheridan,  I have just checked with RAC (David Gorte) and we have a green light to go ahead with the project. I shall you tomorrow to discuss the details.  Vince 
 Bryan,  Did you have a chance to take a look at the resume I sent you? He looked like a great guy for your group.  Vince 
 David,  A reminder. We discussed a few days ago a consulting arrangement with Prof. Sheridan Titman from UT. Any feedback from Rick Buy? Please, let me know.  Vince 
 Darrell,  Thanks a lot. A quick question: we haven't received your invoice for the last few model / paper reviews. Please, make sure that we are billed.  Clewlow/Strickland book is out. I shall send you a copy today.  Vince 
 Al,  I have spoken with Mark Lay and he is interested. Even if we cannot help you here in Enron, he may be able to put you in touch with other CV groups in town.  Please, call him directly and give my name as a reference. (713) 853-7408  Good luck.  Vince 
 Martin,  No problem. Please, ask Stinson as well.  Vince 
 Johan  My apologies for getting back to you with a delay.  We shall be interested in talking to James. Please, let me know if:  1. You have an umbrella agreement with Enron 2. Can we contact James directly, or should we work through you.  Vince 
 Al,  I have called Mark Lay and left a message on his voice mail.  Vince 
 Candice,  Maureen was sick for the last few days. When she comes back, I shall ask her to start the process regarding a formal offer for you.  Vince 
 Dale,  I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that I can tell you at this point.  The commercial groups are still interested and are moving towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the product. As I have  said, we are not the decision makers in this case.  I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.  Vince 
 Neil,  I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman. We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep every few days).  Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request). The lawyers advised me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration of  his stay.  Sorry for the confusion.

 What about 9:30. I have a dentist appointment at 7:45 but I should get to the office by 9:30.  Vince 
 Molly,  Thanks for the update. Two points.  Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system. We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it. I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.  Also, if I have the choice between upsetting Neil or Jeffs (Shankman and Skilling), I shall choose Neil.  Vince      Enron North America Corp.

 Melinda,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Carrie,  We have invited the team to dinner Thursday, 7:00 p.m. Would you loike to join us?  Vince 
 Molly,  We want to hire this very bright young man as a part-time employee, reporting to Mike Roberts. Mike will be contacting you regarding the details.  Vince 
 Soussan,  Nice to hear from you. Dinner on Wednesday, Jan 31 would be great. Please, let me know where you are going to stay.  Vince 
 Aysu  Please, send the resume to me.  Vince 
 Steve,  What about coffee at 10, Thu?  Vince 
 Christie,  Feb the 20th is the best time for me.  Vince 
 Craig,  This is a resume I have received. He does not fit my group. Any interest?   Vince 
 Steve,  What about Thu?  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Steve,  Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal rules going forward.  My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full picture. Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no control long-term.  I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules for the Research sign-off.  Vince 
 Steve,  I was delayed on my wait out. I probably hit the stop at 6:15.  Let me buy you a coffee this afternoon. What about 2:00?  Vince 
 Debbie,  This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies but the rest is in the Winston's hands.  Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on Tanya's report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very mechanical implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to optimize it.  Let's keep paddling along.  Vince 
 Steve,  Around 6:00 p.m.  Vince 
 David,  I am an adjunct professor at Rice. Can I get access to EMBANET?  Vincent Kaminski Managing Director - Research Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street Room EB1962 Houston, TX 77002-7361  Phone: (713) 853 3848 Fax  :  (713) 646 2503 E-mail: vkamins@enron.com 
 Francesca,  It was nice meeting you in San Antonio. An article from FT on IPOs in case you missed it.   Vince Kaminski 
 Mike,  We are short manpower in London. We shall try to evaluate the software in Houston.  Vince 
 Please, put it on my schedule.  Vince 
 Kathy,  What is EMBANET? Do I have access from the outside?   Vince Kaminski 
 Vasant,  No problem.  Vince 
 Steve,  Please, let  me know when you come back. I have detected a tendency to implement different approaches to valuation in the past.  To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the originators to control the outcomes.  Vince 
 John,  Thanks for the article. I was off for the last few days and I ma catching up with my mail. I shall call you during the next few days.  Vince 
 Kristin.  Kim is a member of the Tiger Team. She is interested in a summer internship with Enron and I shall be glad to take her.  Vince 
 FYI  The list of the delegates from Petronas.  Vince Kaminski 
 Vasant,  What do you think?  He may be expensive.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Norma,  I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed merit and equity increases.  I have slightly exceeded the merit quota. The equity increases address two issues: retention and and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).  Please, let me know if there are any questions. I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address so I can work on it tonight, if necessary.  Vince 
 Marc,  Thanks for the invitation. I shall attend.  Vince Kaminski Enron 
 David,  I am  sending you the questions submitted by Petronas for our meeting on Feb 8.  Are you going to invite additional RAC people to the meeting (Bill Bradford would be helpful with credit questions, Bjorn may be interested as well).  Vince 
 Steve,  Thanks.  I got out of my LU positions last week.  What do you think of MOT, NT and TXN? Thinking about jumping in after a big drop.  Vince 
 Anita,  Please, catch me tomorrow to talk about it.  Vince 
 Steve,  I can order the books at 15%  discount. I am sending you 4 copies today and will be glad to order  more on your behalf.  Vince 
 Molly,  Thanks. Let's wait for Sandeep: he comes back Wednesday. Anshuman will work with him.  Vince    Enron North America Corp. 
 Norma,  It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the mistake by moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.  As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity raises. The column totals are misleading.  I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments. I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).   Vince 
 Zimin  What about Paulo?  Vince 
 Iris,  Tom Gros is the person who can  help.  Vince 
 Vasant,  FYI  Vince 
 Stinson,  Can you ask Alex and Tanya to interview this guy? I wan to make a recommendation to Celeste based on an this interview.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Molly,  I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week. I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project as a person delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston. To be absolutely above the line, I would still arrange the L1 visa.  Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 Molly,  Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a while once  he comes. It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him longer, given the priority of the project.  I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.  Thanks.  Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 Molly,  This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.  We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here.  Vince  P.S. The relevant section.  I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat. 
 Steve,  No problem. It was a very short meeting (most people were out). Yes, I will be in Houston during the week of the conference. See you in Austin and in Houston.  Vince

 Hi Kim,  I don't see any problem. For the time being, he can keep his desk on the 19th floor as well ( and the same phone number).
