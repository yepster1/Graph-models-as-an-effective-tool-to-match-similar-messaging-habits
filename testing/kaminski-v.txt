 Shirley,  Please, send it to the entire group.  Vince  ****************************************************************************** ****************  This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for cleaning the conference rooms after  meetings. For many  visitors to Enron a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company.  Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch boxes on the table.  Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you that your mothers don't work here.  Vince

 Kevin,  Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton received a conditional approval contingent upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate exact definition of the deliverables and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for transfer will be rejected. Anything else would be highly demoralizing to everybody.  Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) though he was advertising the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be aware of it, because I have serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.  Vince

 Shijie,  We would like you to meet tomorrow morning, starting at 9:00,  with a few members of the group. Around 11:15 we shall go to lunch (myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu). At 1:00 we would like you to make a presentation to the Research Group on the topic of your choice. After 2:30 we shall continue with individual meetings.  We shall give you an agenda with the names and times when you arrive.  You can come to the lobby of the Enron building (1400 Smith) between 8:30 and 9:00 and call me (3-3848) or my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (3-5290), to be admitted to the building. We are on the 19th floor.  Look forward to meeting you.  Vince Kaminski 
 Mark,  Steve's comment has many merits. I think Stinson Gibner and Grant Masson (physics Ph.D.'s) can help to identify academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.  On the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in their time estimates, the technology they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous potential payoffs. It make sense to stay close to them and  to explore potential investment opportunities.  Vince

 Anita,  My version. Minor changes.  Vince 
 Stinson,  We can  offer him a job. The problem is, he has about 2 more years to go.  Vince 
 John,  I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.  As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.  Vince 
 Hi Jana,  The dress is casual.  In this restaurant we can sit outside (quite casual) or inside (more formal dress, but still casual).  I shall  also send you the directions to my home, just in case.  Vince 
 Hi Jana,  The trip was very interesting and I am still recovering.  On Friday we can meet at the restaurant. It's on the edge of the Woodlands. We can then go to our home and have drinks and chat.  The restaurant is:  Amerigo's Grill 25250 Grogans Park Dr Spring, TX 77380-2175 Phone: 281-362-0808  I have sent you an URL of the map of the part of the Woodlands where Amerigo's is located.

 Cantekin,  Can you figure out the reason for cocoa beans VaR fluctuations? The same is true of aluminum. I assume this is the position change.   Vince 
 Osman,  Yes, but a visa may be a problem.  Vince 
 Ted,  We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to validate some  inputs before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both London and Houston work with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.  A few comments.  1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston (Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs. The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee, please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).  2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated positions and prices on a regular basis.  3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:  a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its portfolios. This is the liquidity risk resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the underlying positions. b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating the position numbers (i.e. look into the details of specific transactions).  From what I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option prices (and deltas). They get some option prices by calling brokers.  4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the inputs are right). But, as I have said, VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.  Vince 
 Sean,  Thanks. I appreciate it. Try David Port or Bjorn Hagelman.  Vince

 Erin,  A book by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka is an excellent non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers. The book has an endorsement  by Jeff Skilling on the cover page.  The Research Group offered  several one-day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry. We still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested. We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall. The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business. The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired power plants).  The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier.  Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely, optimistic, pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.  The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk. This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project.  The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The challenge is not to run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand specific  businesses into parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to stress-test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions. If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions. I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices, but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic  upward trend. One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what Economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.        Enron North America Corp.

 I am forwarding the resume of Wendell Licon who works for Enron in the HR department (executive compensation). He used to be an FX trader.

 Rick,  The IT person Tanya would like to have dedicated to the MG effort is Ganapathy Ramesh.  Vince 
 Dale,  My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London. We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate this process. Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around him any longer.  I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase. I would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility. A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market. We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in practically every location where we operate.  A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false security for both an employee and the company.  I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc you. I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.  Vince 
 Beth,  I cannot read this message.  Vince 
 Anita,  Thanks. Vince 
 Tom,  Thanks for your message.  I shall be glad to attend the meeting (of course a lot may happen between now and then and we may have many unexpected developments in a company as dynamic as Enron).  I want to get back to you at some point with comments on your paper.  Vince 
 Lance,  I could not open the attachment. I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project and limit intern's access to additional information.  Vince

 Shirley,  Here it is.  Vince 
 Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to $100. You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.  Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince

It is seeking vehicles on which to build business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such as logistics, chemicals, agricultural products and pulp & paper.  Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets. He argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those industries.  As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce platform, EnronOnline, which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales.  The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power - saw wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first quarter.  Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar energy business into new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts point out Enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of gas and power in the US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth.  "It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an orderly way," says Ronald Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. "What they're doing here is what they've been incredibly successful at doing," he adds, noting that Enron posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per cent from the previous year.  Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of the company's overall income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone sees the unit's ebit increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years.  As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is standardising contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant, risk management and financial services over the internet.  "We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide liquidity and we will provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract," Mr Skilling says. "That is an extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites, they don't do that."  Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will triumph over the other, bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, price, credit and fulfilment.  Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for example, would rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco recently purchased a 3 per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston- based, neutral wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and American Electric Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity.  Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, Enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring MG, Enron got a stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical position.  "It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active physical spot market in more markets in the world," says Greg Whalley, chief executive officer of Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other markets, Enron will deliver better pricing, price risk management services, cross-commodity transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers.  Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for restructuring an industry.  "If you can take that platform, and you use the capabilities the bricks bring to the table, e-commerce the industry and change the structure, you're selling for more than a 50 multiple."

 Jana,  A correction. I am going to spend one week in Australia and I have just realized that I have to leave on Friday, July the 14th, at night, to arrive in Sydney on Sunday morning.  Maybe we can meet on Friday the 7th (we would like to invite you to dinner and then we can have a glass of wine outside, the weather and mosquitoes permitting).  Alternatively, we can meet during the weekend of July the 29th.   Vince

 John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.  If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.  If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.  In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form the point of view of a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is equivalent to using a discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we all agree. It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not have good answers.    Vince

 David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.  Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.  We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.  2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.  3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.  Vince

 An interesting piece of information from the oil markets. Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).  The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst). He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations. He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and transparency of the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by Saddam's government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.  Vince

One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a symposium in Paris on June 10 on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you (or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to evaluate the usefulness of this project.  I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.   Vince
