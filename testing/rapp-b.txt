 Mark,  Here's the address where you send things for filing with FERC:   Mr. David P. Boergers, Secretary Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426 
 I am available from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. (but not after 11:00 a.m.) and after 2:00. 
 Maria,  I've been trying to get through to you by telephone but keep getting a busy signal. I'm in my office for a little bit longer this evening and will be in all day tomorrow. My number here is 35269. Thanks. 
 =09 =09Greg,  =09=09Thanks for sending me copies of the pleadings in the enforcement acti= on that we've filed against SoCal Gas at FERC. Just a quick question. Shoul= d we initiate a state court action against SoCal Gas now so as to minimize = any claims that could potentially be cut off by the applicable statute of l= imitations? I notice that the controversy goes back to 1996. It may take a = while for FERC to resolve this. Have we concluded that even if FERC rules i= n our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enfor= ce our rights under the transporation agreement(s) with SoCalGas? Even if w= e file a state court action now, SoCal Gas would probably argue that the st= ate court action should not proceed until FERC reaches its decision. I don'= t know how strong an argument this is, but even if SoCal Gas keeps us from = moving forward with a state court proceeding, would merely filing suit in s= tate court stay the statute of limitations? I'm sure you've thought through= these issues already. I'm just trying to get up to speed. Thanks. 
 That's fine with me. 
 I hope we are not planning on meeting for several hours. I have another meeting scheduled starting at 10:30. Also, where are we meeting? 
 I'm having faxed to each of you a summary that was prepared by Michelle Lokay of the bids that were received by third parties for the USGT capacity. I understand that the preference is to provide FERC with a summary rather than the actual bids. 
 Michelle,  Here's a draft of the letter. Please let me know what you think. Thanks.   Bill 
 Greg,  When you have a chance, I think it would be a good idea for me to brief you on the latest developments regarding Enron Compression Services. 
 Charlie,  I think your summary is very good. I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with "adequate assurance" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service. 
 Actually, I recommended that we attach the entire bids and not the summaries. I believe it was Mary Kay and Steve Kirk who thought the summaries would be better. 
 Steve,  I understand from Maria Pavlou that you are reformatting and also perhaps editing the data request responses that I drafted. Please forward to me a copy of the proposed revisions as soon as they're available so that I can review them. Thank
