 weekend was good,the place looks good,the boat was fun, we caught trash fish on bait. 
 the couch is just right, i did make the beds to the best of my ability. i did not use wally wally. i did however leave a pot that was wet on the bottom that created a stain i forgot that granite is a porous rock it absorbed the water quite well i hope that it will dry out if not we will do what is necessary to fix it. i am totally serious about the granite 
 i am not kidding the kids were using the pot i had cleaned it and forgot to dry it. i have no idea are next trip. like i said we will pay if it does not dry 
 i am open, i know we can pull some strong people from this group. i can discuss this with you over beer this evening if you can. sorry i did not call you yesterday, i talked to fred lagrasta and he is currently in a holding pattern. rice will go 9-3 and will not go to a bowl game
