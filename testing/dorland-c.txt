385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company.  Thanx for all the help!  Chris 
 THANX 
 You need to get set up on msn messenger. I takes 2 seconds. Ask an IT guy. 
 Apparently I have the wrong number. Give me a call when you get out of the meeting.  Chris 
 Ryan,  What's going on? Give me a call at home. 214-0454  Talk to you later.  Chris 
   PLEASE ADVISE ASAP 
 I'll give you a call later to discuss... 
 Maria,  That is pretty close but we don't even have real guns... just snowballs....  How are things going down there? I am pretty much settled now but still waiting for a bunch of furniture so my house is pretty empty. Hope all is well.  Chris 
 Tych,  Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.  Chris 
 Nice  Are you going to TO? 
 They are wrong.  Chris 
 I'm in and hopefully I can even find a date.  Chris 
 Did you receive the POA?  Chris 
 Grigs,  I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.  Chris 
 The bonus structure was lined out in detail in a couple of HR video conferences we had with Houston. It is about 10X better than enrons.

 Kiron,  I am not that familiar with the corporate finance side of the business but I will ask around as to who would be a good person for you to contact. You might want to start with Kyle Kitagawa who is a VP in our Calgary corporate finance group. You can reach him at kyle.kitagawa@enron.com or 403-974-6700. Let me know if I can be any further help.  Regards,  Chris Dorland  403-974-6910 chris.dorland@enron.com 
 Thank you. 
 Stephanie  My phone number needs to be changed on the web site. My new number is 403-974-6910.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 I think that show is on this weekend on WTN. After Martha Stewart. 
 Thanx 
 Stephane,  Can you please set up a flexible template in excel so that we can fool around with the numbers on our X forecast and make copies of the historical data for the last 3 winters for everyone. I would like to have this done today so I can see the finished product before the meeting. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanx  Chris 
 Can you please send her this data?  Thanx  Chris 
  Let's get together this week and talk about our winter forecast for the X. I was thinking thursday afternoon around 2:30. I'll touch base with Holst and see if the west guys can join us via conference call. Let me know if that works for you.  Dorland 
 Tricia,  I was wondering how I get set up with shaw cable internet access. Do you have a number I can call?  Chris

 Just trying to bang a living out of this market. I get here at 6:30 everyday. I also leave at 4-4:30. 
 Hi Vicki,  I did receive it and I will fax it over this afternoon. Thanx for all you help.  Chirs Dorland 
 thanx 
 That is weird. Who would take the time to figure that out?  Chris 
 Looks like bullshit to me. How was the Deer this weekend? What are you doing this weekend? I will probably just be moving all weekend but we should go out next weekend.  Chris 
 Get on MSN Messenger 
 Stalker,  I just talked to Milly and he suggested I get with you to talk about our position on Duke's aquisition of Westcoast. I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke's marketing organization. Let me know when you have got a minute.  Chris 
 Keith,  How was Portland? I'm out of the office moving most of Monday but I'll give you a call on Tuesday. Did you get a chance to drop of my keys at the rental office?  Chris 
 Megan,  I haven't bought a car yet but I will let you know when I get one. When do we get the stalls in E&Y?  Chris 
 Tim,  I spoke with Mike Swerzbin earlier today and he suggested that I get access to your web site. If you could set me up that would be great. Also if you could send me the URL.  Thanx  Chris 
 Sorry I didn't get back to you. I have to run some errands tonight. Give me a shout at work tommorow. 974-6910  Chris 
 If one year ago you bought $1000 worth of Nortel today it would be worth $50. If one year ago today you bought $1000 worth of budweiser, drank all of it and returned the cans you would have $80. 
 Vicki  I called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May. I never received the check and am wondering what to do next? The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago. I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have. Please contact me if you need any further info. or with any questions.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910 
 John,  Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend. Car I was going to look at sold already. How are things going? Married? I am soo glad to be back in Calgary. I didn't think much of Houston. Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A new sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company. AA+ credit will be nice. They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing. Hopefully a little more stable than Enron. I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be. Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food.

 Do you have the phone numbers for these guys?  Thanx  Chris 
 Nice!  What's going on? I think my stuff is here on Friday so that means moving in this weekend. We should see if Johnny is going to be around on Friday night. My number at work is 974-6910.  Chris 
 Tricia,  I have completed all the forms you need. Let me know when you have a minute and I will drop them off.  Chris 
 Brad,  Any progress on the direct line with the west desk? If we need to use a different circuit or something let me know. I called Mike Grigsby and asked him to look into it on his end. It is important that we get this line working as soon as possible.  Chris 
 I need that receipt and photocopy asap please. 
 Hi Traci,  I had a very relaxing weekend. Slept 10 hours both nights. Worked out and chilled. Very good weekend except for the weather. No worries about Friday. The highways were ridiculous. My brother is coming to town on Thursday for a week. It will be good to see him. I am planning on being in Red Deer on the weekend of the 8th. Maybe we can get together then. Let me know if you are free.Have a great week and I will speak to you soon!  Chris 
 Mike,  Can you light a fire under the phone guys in Houston to look into fixing our line. I'll talk to our guy and get his gas in gear.  Chris 
 I have transferred to Enron Canada (Calgary). Please forward it to me here.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 403-974-6701
