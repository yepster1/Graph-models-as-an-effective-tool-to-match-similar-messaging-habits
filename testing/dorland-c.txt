lk to Fletch and Presto but it makes sense for me to be there by then. I am coming to town on Thursday. I'll probably drop by the office on Friday.  Chris 
 Things are look up on the Sept/Oct. Spread I think I am going to add to my position. Cash going out week.  Chris 
 Mikey,  I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo. I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area. I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst. A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods. Have you heard of it? What is the plan for the weekend. You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl's with the Dorlands. Maybe we could track down Johnny after. Are you taking a chica to the wedding? I am so looking forward to coming home. I got my face ripped off last week. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 Linda,  I found your email address on the internet so disregard the message I left on your cell. The following properties are the type of place I have in mind. I thought that these would give you a better idea the general concept I am looking for. I am starting to think that a townhouse / infill is a better way to go as opposed to an apartement style condo. I look forward to meeting you on Friday. Below are some MLS #'s of properties that interested me and my contact # in Red Deer / Calary.  Thanx  Chris Dorland  Cell 713-416-6694 Red Deer home 403-343-7086  MLS#'s  2164012 2164008 2164018 2164023 2165562 2180545 2180565 2180660 2178878 2161367 2166627 2179996  I have also heard a lot of good things about Garrison Woods and would like to check that development out. 
 Ack,  What's up? Are you in town this weekend? Thinking of coming to town to look at a car on Sunday and wondering if you would take some time to be my tour guide. Drop me a line of give me a shout.  Dorland  Chris Dorland h 403-214-0454 w 403-974-6910 c 403-875-6146  chris.dorland@enron.com cdorland@hotmail.com 
 Congrats on the CFA! Maybe one day I'll get off my lazy ass and give it a shot.  Chris 
 Congrats on the CFA. I am actually fighting back today. How much time a week would you say you spend on yard work? I am thinking that I will go with a place more like yours. Let me know what you think. I am going to have to get Monica back. 
 So much for being bullish. 
 I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work. A little old for my taste as well. She is hot though. She looks exactly like Mariah Carey. It is great hanging out with her. It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties. Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town. 
 Thanx. I haven't done a trade in over an hour. 
 Now that I have a place to live all I need is a chica. I am going to a wedding in Red Deer next weekend and there should be plenty of available young ladies there. How is Mike McD? Are you married yet? Any kids on the way? 
 3 songs. I can deal with that. 
 I looked at the MLS listings and there is some stuff on there. I have a realtor who seems to have her act together. Don't worry about it. How long would it take me to get to work from there? 
 I already have a minature goat. I am a little concerned about making a housing decision in one day but what the fuck. 
 Done. I'm moving in! Can I borrow your lawn mower? I need to decide what I am going to do with my ride. I think I am going to bring it with me and buy a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires. Don't you have a tire guy? 
 Traci,  I am really looking forward to my cooking class. My first one is this Saturday morning. I'm a little scared I am going to be the class screw up. Oh well, I won't know untill I try. I think I am going to Yoga on Wednesday but dinner on Friday would be great. Give me a shout or drop me an e-mail and let me know what time you want to eat and I'll make some reservations. Talk to you soon.  Chris 
 Lee Clarke... Sounds like a fag. Garrison woods that is the place my mom was talking about. Do you live near there? 
 I really want to live in Altadore. I hear that is where all the fly bitches hang. I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ? Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am thinking of checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do you have any ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?  CD 
 Actually lots. Keep this on the QT for now but this kid is moving back to cow town. I'll be in town next week shopping for somewhere to live. Just in time for ski season.  Later  Chris 
 I want stag details.  Chris 
 Not good. Listen to this. At the end of the day dailies traded down to 85 bucks. Check that range 85-275. I need a vacation. 
 The range on my next day power was 110 to 260. 
 I am long the Sept-Oct NX1 spread about 250 times. I love that trade. Rack up another half million for me today. Fuck! 
 Want to hear about a bad day. Down $2 million USD today. Temps came in 10 degress hotter than we thought in the Northeast this week and blew up!  Chris 
 John,  I talked to Fletch yesterday and I think I am going to come back to Calgary. I'll give you a call this afternoon or Monday to talk about details but I just thought I would drop you a note so you could get the ball rolling with HR on your end. Talk to you soon.  Chris 
 I think a mid sept tee time will work. I want to try to be there for the off site with the west guys. Tell John Z I'll call him this afternoon.  Chris 
 I was just yanking your chain. Deep breaths. Go ahead and make whatever adjustments.  Chris 
 Sherry,  I haven't forgetten about the numbers on the pictures I will send them to you tommorow. A guy in my office was wondering if you can order Stickley furniture through you buying group. Can you let me know if you get a second.  Thanx  Chris 
 Nov-Mar Sumas has moved about 0.20 since I started watching it. I guess that's enough vol. for me.  Chris 
 The guy who ran our trading operation in Calgary really wanted to move back to Houston because his girlfriend lives hear so that left a hole in our Calgary trading operation so they asked me to come back. See you in a couple of weeks.  Chris 
 Ryan,  What's up? I don't know if you heard yet but it looks like I am moving back to Calgary in mid September. I will see you August 17. I'm coming home for Matt and Jen's wedding. Take it easy.  Chris 
 Bastard 
 Do you have Ryan's e-mail address? 
 Thanx for getting back to me so quickly. I am looking for something about 1300-1500 sq. feet with one bedroom plus den or 2 bedrooms. The price range I was thinking was $225-250 K. Hope that helps. I will give you a call later in the week .  Chris Dorland 
 I am going to be moving back to Calgary from Houston in mid september and am looking to buy a loft or condo in the downtown area. I am thinking about 17th ave. and Kensington but I am open to other ideas. I will be in Calgary a couple of times in the next few months and would be interested in getting together to look at properties. If you could send me an e-mail with your contact info. I will call you to arrange an appointment. Thanx for the time.  Chris Dorland Enron North America 1400 Smith Street Houston, Texas   77002 (713) 853-1663 Chris.Dorland@enron.com 
 I might be moving back to Cow town. I'll call you later... 
 Give me a call at home tonight. I just got a call from Lavo.  Chris 
 Mikey,  What are you doing Labour day long weekend? I was thinking of going to TO to see Dan. Any interest?  Chris

 I can't get any more than this... 
 I would like to sign up for the sprint broadband direct but it isn't a selection on the click at home website. Please inform.  Chris Dorland 3-1663 
 Mike,  I wish I was there to witness Dan in action. I will be next year for sure. Can't wait to see Johnny. Hopefully there are some single hotties at the wedding. There hasn't been a cougar sighting recently. Better hop. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 Mohammed  What's going on? I hope school is going well. I am sure you have heard but things are getting back to normal around here. I think working for UBS is going to be really good. Seems like the cultures are going to mix really well. I am thinking about buying a porsche. I really like the 993's but I don't really like the 996's. Looking around for a nice low km 1994-97 C4. Anyway don't work too hard and keep in touch.  Chris 
 Mike,  What's going on? It is hot as shit down here. I had to get a new # because that crazy cougar was stalking me. It is 713-665-8145. Just kidding my old phone company went belly up. I am really looking forward to Matt and Jen's wedding. I bought a new lampshade to wear. Be sure to get Matt all fucked up on the stag. Talk to you later.  Chris

 What is this thing? Mo got into the MBA program at the Rotterdam School of Management. How perfect is that? Going to do his MBA in Holland. You should call and congratulate him. It is actually a really good school. I am definately going to visit.  Chris 
 Crystal  Sorry it took so long to get back to you. My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs. Lots of fun. I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation. Are you over your cold yet? It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July. I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th. I watched the NY fireworks on TV. We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest. Better get back but I'll write back later.  Chris 
 Crystal,  How was your trip? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat. We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better destination. Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the humidity. Can't wait. Take it easy.  Chris 
 Nav  What's going on. When I moved to Houston my e-mail address book got toasted so I am glad you sent your address. What's new? Where are you working now? I am in Houston trading electricity now. I like the job but the city is a dump.  Take it easy  Chris

 Dad,  Booked my flight home in August.  Arrive Thursday Aug.16 at 3PM Depart Monday Aug. 20 at 3:40PM  Chris 
 I talked to JL yesterday. He didn't exactly embrace the idea. Told me to let him think about it. I'll let you know if I hear anything else. Give me shout at home tommorow if you get a minute.  Home 713-588-5131 Cell 713-416-6694 
 I am dead tired. We had a group offsite this weekend and it was a gong show. I haven't had a chance to talk to JL yet but I am going to try to catch him this afternoon.  Chris 
 John  Give me a call when you've got a minute and I'll bring you $ for the tickets.  Chris 
 Bastard. This weekend I am going to a lake resort north of Houston with the guys in our group ( and all their wives and kids). Should be OK. Say Hi to all the boys.  Chris 
 Look at ENE 48.75. Easy money.  Chris 
 Great story. I think that was my Grandma Ivie. 
 John  What is the plan for Thursday night?  Chris 
 Keith just told me that Mckay is moving down here. I guess it is out now. Did you talk to John Z?  Chris 
 Checked out the whiskey on Saturday. It is a really cool club but the no under 25 takes away from the talent pool. You still coming to town next weekend? Let me know.  Chris 
 Apparently GS is going to issue a report saying ENE is worth $68 a share.  Chris 
 I got 4. 
 I like number 6. I should put a sign on my desk that says that.

 TJ,  This has something to do with my cell bill. Can you make sure it got paid.  Thanx  Chris 
 Matt,  Looking forward to the wedding. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to make it August long weekend but say high to Johnny and think of me. Take care and be sure to say hi to Jen.  Chris 
 Jackie,  I'm glad you made it through another Dancentral production. All is going we= ll hear. Work is very busy. I didn't know that Andrea was expecting again. = Be sure to send my congrats and best wishes. I hope Mark is feeling better.= He is too yound to be so stress. Sounds like your new house is beautiful. = I bet you are looking forward to being all settled. Better get back to work= . Great to hear from you and please send my best to everyone.  Chris 
 Would you like to buy some $84 ENE Calls? How is you day going? Did you come to an agreement regarding your trip? Let me know what time you are going to be home tonight and I'll give you shout.  Chris 
 The girl of my dreams. 
 I checked out the whiskey on Saturday. Pretty cool club but the music has to go. And the whole no one under 35 policy really detracts from the talent. Mike is coming to town on Saturday and we are going to hit the town. Talk to you later. I have an excellent instilling jealous rage in the ex story for you but I'll save it to tell you in person.  Chris 
 How about TD bank. The gift that keeps on giving. Power still weak. 
 Have you made a packing list yet? I would have. Getting excited I bet. Better get back to work. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 Thanx  I'll keep those suggestions on file. I got him a pretty cool hammock from this Sharper Image type place. Hopefully it will help him relax a little.  Chris 
 No chance of me getting back on the cougar trail. I have devoted myself to scouting out dumb blondes under the age of 25. Ideally I will find some 22 year old Britney Spears look alike. Wish me well.  Chris 
 I'll be there for the wedding. No stag for me though. 
 I had to put the cougar to sleep. Too annoying for words. What happened to the hot from the picture? 
 I slept (was passed out) through the whole thing. My car is on the 4th floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine. I love the MTV movie awards. Shannon Elizabeth rules. Halle Berry naked in Swordfish. Can't wait. What's new with you? 
 Grant,  Who is your contact at Zargon? We have a discrepency between tagg and the confirm on the term of a deal and I need to talk to the marketing contact to figure out what is correct. We sold them a cal 01 crude put (according to the confirm) but the system has it continuing until feb 02.  Thanx Chris 
 What's up? I nearly drowned on the way home the other day. Beautiful weather we're having. Are you feeling better? I got a cold but I feel better today. The trick is getting 10 hours of sleep a night. Tonight is the MTV movie awards. I really need to get a life. I mentioned the party to Rob but he forgot to ask Darlene. I'll let you know if they are coming tommorow. Talk to you later.  Chris 
 You can send it at any time during the day.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 John,  Rob and I are both in for golf on Sunday.  Chris 
 No problem. 
 You are in charge. I think some DVD's is a super plan. I was also thinking that a really nice hammock would be a great gift but I have no idea where to get one. I will talk to mom and see if she knows where we could get one.  Chris 
 Rod,  I was thinking of buying my dad some cd's for father's day. Any suggestions? Be sure let Christina know I hope that she is feeling better.  Chris 
   Pls migrate and notify of any help needed.  Daniel (281-541-6203) 
 I would e-mail rod but fucking outlook lost my address book. Do you have his e-mail. 
 Good idea. I'll e-mail Rod and see if he has any other suggestions.  Chris 
 Isn't it June 17. I got him a card but not a present yet. I got the card when I was home and put both our names on it. What do you want to do about a gift? 
 that is some funny shit. how did you make out on saturday? I bailed and went home. we are going to hit the whiskey on saturday. should be good. talk to you later.  chris 
 Do I just come down and change my card ?  Chris Dorland 3-1663 
 I replied to this message earlier that I would like to move to the Enron Center garage but have not received a reply. Can I just go to the parking desk on level 3 and change my 1600 Smith card?  Chris Dorland 3-1663 
 Very nice! I hate it when that happens. How is you week going? Mine has been pretty crazy but we're half way there. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 Rod,  When I am in the US can I buy/sell securities in my RRSP?  Chris

 Just a little something to brighten up your weekend! 
 I'm glad you had a good time. I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain.  cd 
 Did you get her address? 
 That guy has a huge pussy!  cd 
 I think that you should make her something. Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache. I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings (from x-mas).  Later skater...   cd 
 Rod,  What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.  Chris 
 Did you send Amanda a card? 
 Hi  Sorry if I blew your party girl cover with one of your colleauges. Cooper and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi. Hope you are feeling better now. Saturday was fun. I shouldn't have gone to the bar. Ended up losing Max at the drink and going home. He was on a rant about his girlfriend and how women are all screwed up. I imagine he picked up some lonely girl. I would love to do lunch one day next week. Let me know when is good for you and if you like sushi. Take it easy.  Chris 
 Hey,  What's up? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans. We might be having a trading group bonding session (dinner and intense drunkeness) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game. Can I let you know tommorow? Let me know...  Chris 
 Crystal,  Scott is off to Dallas for the weekend but I think I can swing checking out a game on Friday. How many people? I'll try to find some Enron tickets. Let me know...  Chris 
 Tych,  I'm looking for 4 tickets for Friday's Astros game. If you stumble upon any let me know.  Thanx  Chris 
 Stock market is exploding. Dow 11133 (up 260). Nasdaq 2150 (up 60). It has to be higher than where you bought now?  Chris 
 You de man! 
 I have 4 tickets for Friday. I don't know if they are good, bad or what but they are free. Talk to you later.  Chris

 How was the Polo match? Did you catch the Sopranos season finale? A little disappointing if you ask me. I worked out yesterday and I can't straighten my arms. A little uncomfortable. Bring on the Advil. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 You not working today? I called like 3 times. Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother? She must be a mess. I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet. Any great ideas?

 I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work. If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North). I'll let you know.

 Hi Traci,  I hope you are having a good week. I am still a little tired from the weekend. Went out with my brother and a bunch of friends friday and saturday. Superbowl on
