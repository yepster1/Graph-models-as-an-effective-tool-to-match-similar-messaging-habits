es will affect his positions.  Chris 
 Mike,  Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.  Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the weekend.  Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.  You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush Juice for a falafel.  Good luck and keep in touch!  Chris 
 Not having to add products (ie. Hub cash) to our composite pages everyday would be more convenient. 
 Brad,  Could you e-mail me your mailing address so I can send off a cheque.  Please make sure I've maximized my foreign content as I don't love the TSE at 9300.  What did you think of that Enron announcement?  Chris 
 Anne,  I didn't receive my USER ID for PEP. Do you know how I get it?  Chris 
 Mike,  Good to hear you arrived safely. Reno was very average. Too much travel. I guess you know all about that.  Hope that work is going well. I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob. Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com, if that doesn't work try  Robert.Benson@enron.com. Let me know if those don't work.  Gotta hop!  Keep in touch,  Chris 
 Brad,  Just thinking about my RRSP's. I want to make sure I have maximized my contributions.  Chris 
 Dianne,  Can you break out buys and sells separately. That format would make it easier for me to transfer the info. to my model.  Chris 
 Dianne,  There doesn't seem to be a new March Aeco product set up. Give me a call.  Chris 
 Hi Andrew!  How are things in London? I am talking to MH right now and he says you are getting a little tired of school. I don't blame you one bit.  I need a vacation. I bet you do to. What do you say to a little Amsterdam trip in April? I think we deserve it.  What do you think of MH changing companies? I think he should get out of that business altogether. He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.  Take care,  Chris 
 Kramer,  Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve. Lavo still trades the term in Alberta but is never around. As for Benny, after an unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil, he has moved to Houston to trade power. No shit!  Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached. I have an idea, like everyone else in the world, for an internet start up and want to pick your brain about the process of doing a business plan, getting VC $'s and such. I don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the industry.  There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich off of it.  Check out enron stock (ENE). We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month. Not bad for a small Texas pipeline company. You would need a sand blaster to get the smile off of Lavorato's face. However I don't think I'm going to retire on my Enron options any time soon.  Gotta hop!  Dorland  (PS You should send Wilson a Bigwords t-shirt. The Jannon's would do the logo justice.) 
 Mike,  Change my e-mail address to Chris.Dorland@enron.com. You have a really old one that I'm surprised is still supported (cdorlan@ect.enron.com).  Chris  (Like you will every see a $ from this!) 
 Kramer,  How are things going? We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip sometime in the  next few months.  Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged. No chicks. Work is going great. Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time.  Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here. I am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics.  Take it easy and w/b,  Dorland 
 Andrew,  Nice to hear from you. Hope all is well in the UK. The millenium came and went and I think I had a good time.  I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML. Good for him. That is a shit business with no future. The broker is the buggy whip of the financial  services industry.  I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to visit. I have to run but I'll keep in touch.  Take care,  Chris 
 If you find any fundamental problems with this model let me know. 
 Angela,  I'll take the 2 tickets for Feb. 25 th vs. Phoenix  Chris 
 The tag number on this deal is N67904.2  Please address all future deal inquiries of this nature to Scott Adams or Kathy Reeves.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 How about my RRSP contributions for this year?  Chris 
 Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst. I had about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer between Friday and this morning.  Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all I know.  Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing happen to him last week.  Chris 
 Happy Anniversary! I will deliver the card in person in about 10 days.  Chris 
 George has Oyster Creek coming back Nov. 25. We have it coming back Nov. 17 on our sheet. Let's assume George's info. is the best.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Just a note regarding my plans for Thanksgiving. I am going to fly out the afternoon of Nov. 21 and will be back in the office on Monday the Nov.27. I will need PJB to cover my daily trading on Nov.22.  Chris 
 I don't know anything about any sunglasses. Just kidding, I was wearing them all weekend.  Chris 
 So the squares are not all the same size. It is an optical illusion rather that a brain teaser.  Chris 
 Any word on my expense $?  Chris 
 Margaret,  How do I get to your office? I would like to come by and get my Visa documents.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 713-853-1663 
 I have received my health insurance and perscription drug card but not my dental card. Hopefully today my mail will find me.  Chris Dorland 
 I haven't called Northern Trust yet. I will call them this afternoon. With regard to the benefits I don't think I have received the 2001 benefits package yet but I will check. If I don't want to change my coverage do I have to fill anything out?  Chris 
 H town is good. Work is crazy but I like my new role. The weather is nice vs. snow in Cow town. How are things with you? Are you still commuting across the country? What is your buddy at William's name? Do you know what region he trades? Getting busy now better hop.  Keep in touch,  Chris 
 Patrick,  Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well. I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for you and keep in touch.  Chris 
 Somebody should check Drewlo's clothes for paint thinner.  CD 
 Laurel,  I have been transferred to Houston, TX. Could you please take me off the Calgary distribution list.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 Lloyd,  I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM load forecast model works. I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to day sensitivity analysis. I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week works for you.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 I haven't received the tickets yet but they are on the way.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Jennifer,  I e-mailed my mail stop number to Rebecca Torres (EB3125A) on Oct.30. and left her a voice mail message yesterday. I just sent her the info. again.  CD 
 Rebecca,  My mail stop is EB 3125A. I e-mailed you that info. on Oct.30 and left you a voice mail message.  CD 
 What a fucking day!  Curve shift (500K) New deals 400K  This is a tough market to trade in. 
 I am at EB3116e.  CD 
 Ricardo,  This consultant report has Brunner Island back on. Our sheet doesn't have it coming back untill Nov.3. Which is correct?  Chris 
 FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). Things in Houston are good. The weather is great now. Year round golf is nice. Power is a total shit show. The volatility is crazy and this is the off season. I need to get rested up for the summer. Take it easy  CD 
 Jennifer,  My pay stub seems to be lost in in the abyss. Is there someone I can call to make sure it finds me?  Chris 
 Hawker,  What's going on? How are things in Cow town? You trading a book yet? Playing any poker? Bingham was here for Q-School last week. Didn't go so well.  Cd 
 Chris Dorland 5151 Edloe St. #14306 Houston, TX 77005 (713)-588-5131  Thanx  Chris  (P.S. I haven't received my pay stub for this pay period) 
 My mail stop is EB 3125A  Chris Dorland 
 TJae  Do you know what my mail stop # is? This person has some mail that doesn't seem to be finding me.  Thanx  Chris 
 Can you send it to my desk at 3116e please.  CD 3-1663 
 I still haven't received a 401K package. Who should I contact to get signed up?  Let me know.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Mike,  What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. I'll call you one night this week.  Chris  5151 Edloe St. #14306 Houston, TX 77005 H 713-588-5131 W 713-853-1663 C 713-416-6694 
 Yes  IS 300 Silver/Black - dark tint on the windows, killer 17's  I am very happy with it. I like it better than the 3 series.  cd 
 I booked my Christmas flights. I am leaving the afternoon of Friday December 15th and I will be back in the office on Tuesday December 26.  Chris 
 Brad,  Can you add Ricardo.Perez@enron.com to this distribution list?  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 Thanks for your attention but I already bought a vehicle.  Chris Dorland 
 Jill,  All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. Better go but keep in touch!  Chris  5151 Edloe #14306 Houston, Texas 77005  H 713-588-5131 W 713-853-1663 C 713-416-6694 
 Ryan,  What's up? Reply to this so I can save you e-mail. I'll write more later.  Chris 
 Jennifer,  I am anxious to get set up on the 401K plan. Who do I need to talk to?  Thanx,  Chris 
 Terry,  I didn't receive any call (I may have accidentally deleted it) but I filled out an accomplishment sheet for Barry Tycholiz yesterday.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Just thought I would drop you guys a note and let you know that I am coming to Houston on Thursday night. I will be in the office Friday morning but I am planning to do a bunch of running around after the cash market slows down. See you in a couple of days.  Chris Dorland 
 Trish,  I used 4 vacation days and 1 Friday.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Can I get the daily Data going back to Apr 98?  Thanx,  Chris 
 Margaret,  Thank you for all you help getting my Visa application prepared. Do you know what documentation I need to have with me at the border? I was planning on bringing the following:  Passport Driver's License Birth Certificate University Transcripts  Is there anything else that I need to bring?  Chris Dorland 
 Ricardo,  Do you have this data daily?  Chris 
 Sorry, I forgot about you!  Chris

 Derek,  Grab me when you have a minute. Just to chat.  Chris 
 Louis  Thank you!  I have been really crazy and was going to come down and talk to you this afternoon.  They were deducting me for parking 9 and parking 11.  Thanx again,  Chris Dorland 
 Brad,  Can you change my address in your system (and with fund companies) to my mom and dad's address. I haven't heard from this nurse yet and I am leaving next week. Please be sure to let me know if any of that Clarica transfer doesn't go smoothly.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Paul,  I would like the following data (and anything else you can think of):  Daily Power Prices  - PJM West / East (Others?) - NYPP - Cinergy -TVA - any other markets that you think are relevant  Temperatures (Max, Min, Mean)  - Philadelphia - Allentown - Pittsburg - Washington DC - Newark - Baltimore - NYC  Gas Prices  - Transco Zone 6 Non- NY and NY - What other pipes are close to the above cities?  Supply (Generation)  - Any information you have on generation in PJM (by plant) including: - Fuel type - Capacity (typical production vs. maximum production) - Efficiency (heat rates) / Marginal production costs - Historic outages - Forecast Outages - Who owns / operates the facilities? - Reserves ? (I am trying to understand what the supply curve for PJM looks like but I am not sure if I am asking the correct questions. What parts of the puzzle am I missing?)  Demand (Load)  - Historic load information for PJM  Interchanges  - What are the historic imports and exports in and out of PJM - What are the costs associated with wheeling power in and out of PJM ?   Thank you for all your help and please include any other info. you think may be relevant.  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910 
 Ricardo,  What is your extension ?  I would like to ask you a few questions and talk to you about what data we have available.  Chris Dorland 
 Margaret,  Please send them to the Calgary office to my attention:  Enron Canada Corp. Atten: Chris Dorland 3500 Canterra Tower Calgary, AB T2P 4H2  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 
 Thank you! 
 Margaret,  I was wondering if you sent my visa documents yesterday or today. I will be out of the office this afternoon but I would come back if my visa documents are going to me here.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Everything seems OK. Hopefully I will hear from the mover's this afternoon.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Margaret,  Could you send the Visa documents to my office:  Enron Canada Corp. 3500 Canterra Tower 400 - 3rd Ave. SW Calgary, AB   T2P 4H2  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 Margaret,  Just wondering how my Visa was coming along? I had a confusing conversation with Jeanne in relocation services this morning. The way I understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same time or after I leave the country. She seemed to think that I had to go to the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada. Can you shed some light on this?  Thanx,  Chris Dorland 
 I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork for him.  Chris
