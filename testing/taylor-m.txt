bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of winning bidders.  Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full amount of their offer to buy.  It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction period but we would like to have that option.  I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.  Harry is preparing the "GTC" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on our standard contracts for these products.  We need to put the legal framework together for the rest of it.  If the existing PA and ETA are adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind. We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of paper.  It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those counterparties would make sense.  Can we talk on Monday? 
 Just out of curiosity, who is Thomas Geisel?  I assume he is an Enron=20 person.  Do we already have a lawyer responsible for these issues?  I seem = to=20 remember that Robert and Justin were handling the IPE and Martin and Mark= =20 Elliott the NordPool and ELEX issues.  It might make sense to have one pers= on=20 be the go-to guy for exchange issues with another designated for each=20 exchange.  What do you think?  It worries me a little to have only business= =20 people involved - particularly if this is an early stage where we may have= =20 our best hope for effective legal input. 
 Just on the off chance you haven't had enough regarding EnronOnline to think about recently, Louise has announced meetings on Thursday and Friday of this week to discuss "Phase II" of the project.  It seems like an opportune time to come up with our wish-list of possible changes to the site and the legal structure. 
 I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but here it is. 
 That sounds right to me - we were going to pay for extra trips (like the ENA legal conference int eh fall) but this meeting is for all lawyers so they would have to pay for this regardless. 
 Jan:  Thanks for your note.  Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.   JAN M KING 02/09/2000 12:30 PM 
 The second product listed here is physical.  It looks ok to me but I don't really know - can you take a look and approve it or comment to Dale please?  Thanks! 
 Here's another one. 
 I have not received any comments.  I consider it final.  Let me know if you need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.  Since I don't know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they need it you send them copies. 
 Here is S&C's first draft. 
 Mark Haedicke and I are scheduled to participate in an ISDA sponsored conference call which begins at 9:00 Eastern time tomorrow morning.  If that call runs over, we may not be able to call you promptly at 10:00 but will call as soon as we can. 
 Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the "auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?  Mark 
 I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri). 
 Are either of you guys aware of this web-site?  It looks like our weather people have put this out on the web ahead of us.  I think we need to talk to them about what they are allowed to post and what sorts of disclaimers should be there as well.  I just wanted to check with you before I call the weather desk here  Mark 
 Paul is out sick today - I'll see what I can find out tomorrow. 
 Collateral Arrangements. Counterparty shall (at Enron=01,s request) either:= (i)=20 within one Business Day of such request by Enron, provide to Enron a letter= =20 of credit in respect of Counterparty's obligations under any Transaction, i= n=20 such form and for such amount and from such issuer, as is acceptable to Enr= on=20 in its absolute discretion; or (ii) within such period as is specified by= =20 Enron, provide for the benefit of Enron a parent company guarantee in such= =20 form and for such amount as is acceptable to Enron in its absolute=20 discretion. Failure so to provide such letter of credit or parent company= =20 guaranty shall constitute a default hereunder giving rise to the immediate= =20 right of termination by Enron under this GTC. 
 Here are my comments (together with my voice mail comment to Dave regarding an earlier deletion). 
 Here are the procedures toegther with our comments.  If you have access to Word, you can see the changes and who made them. 
 I'm afraid I disagree with Justin but prefer not to do so publicly.  It seems to me we need a verifiable end time for the Auction Period and should choose a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties (presumably UK for EnBank but Central for emissions credits). 
 Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade UK derivatives should have access.  Mark 
 It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.  They want this auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the expiration time.  There is still no commitment to sell anything.  All transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.  I have taken a stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind. 
 Would you please check and see if we have any JEDI swaps wtih these counterparies? 
 Here's a stab at tthe procedures which provides for hte ability to revise or revoke bids during the auction period.  Comments? 
 FYI 
 I'm not sure which "process" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is unclear).  The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US. For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on both sides of the walls. 
 With the final comment from Sullivan & Cromwell: 
 Is this a document that is available generall?  If so, can we get a copy? 
 Yes, this looks better to me. 
 FYI 
 I'm not sure I agree with you.  There is a big difference between listing the price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high ground if the reference entity later decides to object. 
 I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use the camera - and thought you might like these.  Unfortunately the only shot on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group shot.  There were several others that you can tell would have been great shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.  The sunset was taken during our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing his lunch down below).  Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?  Mark 
 Edmund:  Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of questions and minor points ont eh GTC -  In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed confirmation to control over other evidence.  Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters.  I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is this particular to credit derivatives?  With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to "deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction? If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control.)  I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 60 days).  I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March. The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention.  This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a different interest rate to non-US$ payments?  It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.  Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason?  Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points.  Mark 
 Jennifer:  Our records indicate that a draft was delivered to you earlier this week.  If you do not have it, please let Marie Heard (x33907) know and she can get you another copy.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 There are a few points in here that you might be interested in - or not. 
 I received the proposed list of reference entities today.  Here is a draft of a memo that I cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others within Enron for the restriced list.  Would you let me know what you think? I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it.  It isn't clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come.  Since the communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is Kristina the right person?  I know that EES has some kind of joint venture with AOL - should Vicki sign off?  If it is going to such persons, should the memo come from Mark?  Cliff Baxter?  John Sheriff?  Jim Derrick?

 My recollection is that we did this on purpose - that the industry works this way for all participants (or nearly all) so we built our documents to reflect that practice.  Do I remember correctly? 
 I just called Diomedes' office to try and get on his calendar next week. They told me he is not there and won't be back until after Carnival which I guess means March 9 at the earliest.  I am in Portland the 6th & 7th (Mon. & Tues.) and Amsterdam the 13th - 17th (Tues. - Fri.).  Unless an emergency comes up it looks like the earliest I can reasonably expect to make it will be towards the end of March (27 - 31?). 
 Here is the list of reference entities I received from Debbie with the confidentiality agreements and the reference entities they relate to indicated.  If the reference entity name is in bold we have a confidentiality agreement with the entity itself.

 I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make sure the second item listed in them works.  Is everyone comfortable that the volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce megawatt hours?  I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - it wasn't immediately obvious to me.

 This is getting a bit confusing - is this list included in Bryan's "Final" list? 
 Should we have Alan in this as well? 
 Looks fine to me. 
 These look ok.  I'm still unhappy with using an average of the index for each day when there is only one index for the entire month but I guess we're stuck with it for now. 
 Also fine - with the same "averaging" concern. 
 This one looks like it is in the "rejected" category.  How should I proceed? 
 My only concern is that it looks like we are modifying the NYMEX price twice - once in the second sentence and then again in th definition of Index. 
 Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light). 
 Carol:  As Tana mentioned in our meeting, the Credit guys are in discussions with Aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap (we think it should be JEDI, they think it should be ECT).  There is a master agreement in place between JEDI I and Inland (which suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been transferred and still binds JEDI I).  Mark 
 I have read the Lucent CA and it is OK to go ahead and keep them on the list - the CA seems to cover a relatively small transaction and expires on March 25 anyway.  We are in the process of pulling the CA's for Dow, DuPont, GE, IMC, 3M, Pitney Bowes, Praxair and Sprint.

 What is the list of proposed Reference Entities for EnronOnline (to go live March 8?)? 
 Richard - do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending litigation?  How should we handle these?  Mark 
 Peter:  I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as collateral in Canada.  We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.  Would you mind checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary office)?  I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens on ourselves that aren't required by law.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Do any of you guys know about this deal? 
 Paul -  Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the list that Michael referred to.  The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.  Mark 
 Did you get a chance to look at the Credit GTC? 
 Carol St. Clair will be the swap lawyer for this transaction. 
 This is the site you had trouble looking at a few weeks ago - I had to send the address a couple of times. 
 Thanks - I needed a good smile today. 
 Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.    Enron North America Corp. 
 There are still certain jurisdictions where we are not offering the product: Germany and Canada come to mind. 
 Richard:  In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Bryan -  In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a variety of people.  Mark 
 David -  The Password Application and ETA look fine to me.  Mark 
 That is correct. 
 It never ends. 
 Do you want legal bills for this aspect of the project sent through on the EnronOnline work order or separately? 
 Thanks for your card and hello to the whole family.  I didn't know you guys were in Mass.  Is this a long term move?  Things are still pretty much the same in Houston.  We'd certainly look forward to seeing more of you down this way! 
 As we discussed, attached is the new list of proposed reference entities.  I have also attached my previous memo outlining the propsosed business and our concerns. 
 Can we do the call at 3:00 Houston time? 
 I'll be there - is it really only to last 2 hours? 
 Why is Enron's stock so volatile now? Since today's session started, ENE has lost another $2.50!  Mr. Ken Lay replies I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several reasons it's more volatile. But before I comment on that, our stock price is still up even if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the year when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off the table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a growth stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, just like all the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market, technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but often $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility on the upside, but I hate it on the down side.  We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's being bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and put it back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little nervous, but this is probably the world we're in now. I'd rather be in this world with a 50 P/E than the more stable world with a 20 P/E. 
 I have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com page.  That process is now underway.  Going forward, I would hope that we will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites before a reference entity is used. 
 I'm not sure anyone told you about this - can you make it on Friday? 
 I'm not sure what "penalites" they're referring to.  I assume it's a physical concept.   If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right person.  If it's gas, probably Stacy. 
 Please give me a call and we can discuss.  Shari is now definately moving to power trading (not public yet) so we really need to figure out how we are going to cover all the bases - short and long term.  I will be out the 14th through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.  It would be grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself that much.  Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is covered. 
 I am not available at all on Friday through Tuesday but the meeting can go ahead without me if necessary.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is a set of disclaimers for your website.  Have you looked into getting the name trademarked?  If not, let me know and I can try and move that along from here. 
 Sorry - it looks like I can not attend.  My travel schedule is pretty tight this month - do you think it makes sense to set something up for April?    Enron North America Corp. 
 David -  I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.  Thanks,  Mark 
 That's perfect - let's aim for May - thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 Ken:  Mark H. asked me to forward to you this initial draft term sheet.  We would like to talk to you, and presumably one of your colleagues, tomorrow regarding the possible antitrust implications of the proposed structure. Please give me a call and we can schedule a time.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Moses, Jesus and an old man are golfing. Moses steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto the green.  Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the water and chips the ball onto the green.  The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth. As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.  Jesus turns to the old man and says, "Dad, if you don't stop fooling around, we won't bring you next time." 
 Dave - Do we have a copy of this marked to show the changes fromt he NA ETA? 
 I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement. 
 May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single page.  This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid out here.  I was also under the impression that a completed registration form was required before a user ID and password could be issued.  While I don't object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form. 
 Then from a legal perspective I don't have any issues.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Edmund -  I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives (I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can discuss my concerns? 
 Ken - here is another (brand new) issue Mark H. asked me to forward on to you that he would like to discuss this afternoon in the anti-trust call. 
 This looks good to me.  Thanks! 
 I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:  1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron relationships.  3. Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the "other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns. Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).  Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only offered pursuant to an unsolicited request. 
 Rod - can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it is related to the Duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality agreements listed below?  I need to know who the parents are and who the subsidiaries are and, if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the reference entity.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Tana -  Please forward copies of the ETA and PA to Paul Davis (e-mail address above).  If you don't have them in your directory, Frank Davis should be able to get them to you.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Martin:  My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 38th floor.  The room number is EB3850.  Sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to HR about a badge.  HR should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.  If it isn't and your HR person is not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to let you in.  Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.  If you haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on Monday morning.  They are more reasonably priced than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract).  We're looking forward to seeing you!  Have a good trip.  Mark 
 Yes, this is fine with me. 
 Edmund:  Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.  I don't think it makes sense to review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.  Please let me know if the situation changes.  Mark 
 Can I get a copy?  I don't really know what we're talking about. 
 Rod - I got your voice mail & we can talk when I get back.  Here is a note I sent to Edmund last week with a suggestion - let me know what you think. 
 I certainly haven't seen anything and there is nothing in our database - you might check with Shari Stack (I'm in Portland until Wed.). 
 Lori - here is the initial "wish list" from the credit derivatives people. If you can focus on these first and let me know about them I'd appreciate it. 
 Any idea what Bryan plans to gain this way?  It's not clear to me that a hard wall solves our problems with RE approvals but that's because I don't know. Maybe Ken can shed some light on this. 
 David -  Thanks for your note.  Just to keep you posted - I plan to be there with my boat but will return to my slip at Kemah Harbor and drive over to the party so I won't add to the size of your raft.  Mark 
 What time is the game on Saturday? 
 I have received reactions from several of the other Enron operating companies (EBS, EES and GPG) requesting that the following entities be placed on the Restricted List for credit derivatives Reference Entities:  AT&T Corp. Baltimore Gas & Electric Company Bell Atlantic Corporation BellSouth Corp. Cable & Wireless plc Comdisco, Inc. Cox Communications, Inc. Intel IBM Lucent Technologies Monsanto SBC Communications Sun Microsystems Union Carbide Viacom Wisconsin Electric Power Company Wisconsin Gas Company  These companies were those on the attached list (forwarded to the various General Counsels on 2/28) which were found to be objectionable for one reason or another.  I have not yet heard from the former EI companies. 
 Mark - This doesn't look familiar to me - is it yours? 
 I have not been given any reasons - the most "considered" list came from EBS where I feel sure some of them were commercial.  I'm not so sure about the EES and GPG lists.  These lists are going to some fairly senior people.  I'm a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary.  My suggestion would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you particularly want to list. 
 We had hoped to have an answer from local counsel in Japan by the end of last week.  Unfortunately we have not yet heard from them.  Alan Aronowitz has sent an e-mail asking for an update on their progress.  As soon as we have their answers to our questions, we will be able to prepare an ETA for counterparties trading from Japan. 
 Hi Mary.  Barbara tells me there's a better-than-good chance you will be coming back to join the department.  Hooray!  I was hoping we could chat about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time around.  I'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when I get back and you should feel free to talk to Carol and Sara in the meantime.  Mark T. 
 Mark H. suggested this morning that he, you and I should plan on getting together for dinner on Thursday evening.  I'm leaving for the airport here in a few minutes and will be reachable in Amsterdam at the Grand Hotel or on my mobile - 44-7881-512-535. 
 Hmmm. - Barbara wasn't 100% sure of your e-mail address....... 
 one more try..... 
 I will not be able to attend Thursday's call. 
 Did we ever talk about this?  The traders (Bob Crane in particular) are giving Dale a hard time - they want to start trading this way immediately. 
 my comments made below 
 Just between you and me, I'm astonished -- delighted but astonished, that they fugured their way through all of those Japanese holidays and the aftermath.  I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I haven't read it yet.  I don't anitcipate any problems.  I can't tell from these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11 or going live for Japanese counterparties then (all of whom must then have already executed PAs and been approved). 
 Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.  I'll coordinate through QD. 
 I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular publication?  If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and check for older prices there and you can cite to that.  Let me know if that doesn't work. 
 Do we have a Netherlands ETA? 
 That's fine with me. 
 David:  Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by non-Australian counterparties.  The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process going forward.  Any chance you might be available for a telephone conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?  Mark

 Pets In the Office It's A Growing Trend  In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some companies. Workers are bringing their pets to the office.  Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has been taking his golden retriever, Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early Show and talked with Co-Anchor Jane Clayson.  The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. "He brings a lot of emotion and people love it. He's very relaxed."  But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to the office if he wishes. Not everybody can bring their pet to work.  "A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not a rowdy dog.  "He just hangs out," explains Paucek. "He's easy to get along with."  Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife brings him in and drops him off at the office," Paucek says.  While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also many legal issues to consider. John Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing.  "More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," says Challenger  He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy.  "One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a policy like that, is take a poll of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain employees that don't feel comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy."  There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee.  "The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect," says Challenger. "The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone, it can't be the company's fault."  Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office.  "Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, will you put them in a certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? Many don't feel comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats and dogs and what about birds? What about the noise of birds?"  Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, "It gets chaotic."  In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. They found that:  21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the job 33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals   If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should:  poll employees before they let the pets come provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office establish an off-limits-to-pets area make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times   If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should make a rotating schedule.  When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when he and Hoss arrive at work, "I get off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the employees. He has his own web page." 
 This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an objection. 
 This doesn't seem to allow me to approve. 
 Here is the e-mail we received from ISDA.  Since we only have $500 left and they are suggesting $1000 for the lunch, I'm not sure it makes sense to send someone.  I've left a voice-mail for Stacey to ask where they stand and whether or not they still want us to send someone. 
 Hey guys!  Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!  I'm still working at Enron in Houston - it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.  I'm in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and issues.  I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well.  I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but haven't heard from him since.  Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New York managing a couple of international mutual funds.  He & Debbie adopted a little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in the middle of Manhattan.  I get up there on business a few times a year and try to stop in to say hi.  I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class "reunion" last June.  There were only 2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!  Oh well, maybe the 25th will be a bigger draw.  C.F.&S., Mark 
 Stacy Carey called back to say that the $500 would appreciated as would a person to attend.  I didn't know if you had anyone who could go so I suggested that someone from your office call her on Monday morning to discuss details.  Stacy's number is (202)457-6545. 
 Cynthia:  Here is a first draft of an agenda for our meeting this afternoon.  Mark 
 Here is the revised Koch confirmation marked to show the changes. 
 I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date as the Buyer Payment Date.  In the version I send to Koch I will change that to Trade Date.  You can always change it to a later date if you want to tomorrow. 
 I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC. 
 Attached is the confirmation revised to include Ken's most recent comments. 
 Tana - please mark up the draft with these comments so I can see what they look like. 
 Jay -  Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.  The problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.  Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate regarding the services they provide to us?  Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be trying to do this the "right" way.  Mark   James Bruce   03/30/2000 02:33 AM 
 There are no requests awaiting my approval. 
 Thanks for the messages - I have not heard anything since they left.  VERY good news! 
 Scott:  The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.  Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.  Thanks,  Mark 
 I'm not sure - I thought we were not adding any products -- just opening existing products to Japanese counterparties.  Is he talking about the existing GTC's for petroleum products?

 Are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in Monmouth next week?  I'm setting up dinner with Doc (instead of the Private Dining Room affair) in case you're interested. 
 When I try to open the link I get an error message saying "You are not authorized to perform that operation."  There are still no requests awaiting my approval in the SRRS icon on my desktop.  Sorry! 
 Doc:  The schedule calls for the meetings to end at 5:00.  There's also a play (The Merry Wives of Windsor) that night and we can work around that if you were planning on going.  Mark 
 Thanks for forwarding all of this stuff - so far it has all been mine.  I think your name must come up automatically for some of these folks when they just type in Mark Taylor.  It's not nearly as bad as when there was another Mark E Taylor - and he wasn't nearly as nice about it either (instead of forwarding them to me, he would send them back to the senders with sometimes nasty notes like 'try to get it right next time').   Luckily for both you and me he is no longer with Enron -- can you imagine how bad it would be if there were three of us?  When I get these, I usually send a note back to the sender letting them know that there are two of us and they need to pay attention when addressing things to one or the other.  Mark 
 "Good meal" in Monmouth?  Not sure if that is really possible by your standards.  I had the Barnstormer in mind.  It pretty much has to be better than the food at the Stockdale Center. 
 You might want to take a read through this one more time just to make sure I have it the way you want it. 
 We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact them.  Thanks for you help.  Mark 
 Approved. 
 I had a note back from Doc asking if we wanted to go to the play after dinner.  If we're not interested he can go on Sunday but if we want to go he'll get us tickets.  I can go either way - what do you think? 
 Thanks for your note - I'll keep those items in mind.  It seems pretty clear to me that the Pres. has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and some gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed.   I asked Mark Kopinski, who is also coming to the planning meeting, if he wanted to join us for dinner so I've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the play or not - I'll let you know what he says - I have mixed feelings since I'd like to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent chatting. 
 Please order enough books for the swaps group and a few extras. 
 Alan:  Regarding the legal comments below:  My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:  i.e. the umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice of law provision.  These agreements have been approved by local counsel in Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that bridge is still ahead of us.  I don't know what the "international contracts" are that Rousseau refers to. There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions. The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed.  In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go.  Mark 
 Rousseau:  I have copied you on an e-mail to Alan Aronowitz which may answer your questions.  If not, please feel free to call and we can discuss your issues. If I am not at hand when you call, my assistant can book a particular time on my calendar so we won't be trading calls forever.  Mark 
 Mark K thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets for us that would be great.  My flight out isn't until around 11:00 Friday morning so I can always stay up late to chat!  I'll be there Thursday morning, too - I'm supposed to attend a lecture at 11 but am free before that - any Chemistry classes or labs I should sit in on?  Mark 
 Any further news from Russia?  There's a good chance I'll have to go to DC for a day tomorrow & if they're back I might be able to get up there to see them - I could try and get an early enough flight tomorrow afternoon that I could spend the evening with them. 
 FYI 
 What do you think?  OK with me, although I think I'm supposed to leave for South America on Sunday evening (gone 5 days or so - this is the trip that has been postponed twice already so I won't be surprised if it is delayed again). 
 Nobody is leaving - it's a new position. 
 Allison -  I don't think they were expecting Cynthia to attend these meetings with me - there will only be one representative from each of the three companies.  I did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me though and to know I was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone else.  My flight out isn't until after 7:00 pm. and I assume that the Luken meeting will be over around 3:00.    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI 
 Just a heads up - Mark H. asked me to set up a day that he and I could come to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over EnronOnline.  I'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential dates. 
 Hey Marc! - We're in town this weekend - let us know if you plan something. 
 Mario -  We have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the EnronOnline launch in Japan.  The advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements are enforceable under the law chosen (e.g. New York for the PA and ETA) they should be enforceable in Japan as well.  Local counsel is aware of our business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls.  We have not looked into the registration of domain names in Japan.  Please let me know if this is required.  Mark 
 Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the airport in Minneapolis.  I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital campaign planning committee meeting.  Mark Kopinski was there and he and I had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. professors) who is still teaching.  I'm now on my way back to Houston - flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.  Hope you are well.  Love,  Mark 
 Are you sure about this?  I didn't know I had a NY bar number. 
 Looks good to me. 
 Robbi:  The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill (bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you. Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.  Mark 
 I don't think this one will work for us - we would prefer a college degree. 
 Angelica lacks an undergraduate degree. 
 Yes, so far that is the plan. 
 The PA and ETA for Japanese counterparties will be identical to those for North America unless they need revision for some commercial reason.  I will try and get to the FAQ's tomorrow. 
 Sorry I didn't get to you today - I have kept a slot on my calendar at 9:00 Houston time tomorrow if that works for you. 
 I will not be able to attend. 
 I will be out the 5th but plan to be here the 12th and 24th. 
 I have not - happy to coordinate with you. 
 See my answers below. 
 Can't we just transfer the billing to me? 
 Alvin:  It was good to meet you at lunch the other day.  Here are my address details if you need them.  Mark E. Taylor Enron North America Corp. (EB3889) 1400 Smith St. Houston, TX 77002  (713)853-7459  Mark.Taylor@enron.com 
 We generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties - regarding tax or other legal consequences to their trading.  The only thing we could safely say would be something to the effect of "If you are concerned about the tax consequences of your EnronOnline transactions, please consult your tax advisor." 
 Here are my FAQ comments - all of the existing answers are still correct. 
 Nedre:  We have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one of them - the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's reactions to the interviews.  If you have other resumes we would be happy to look at them - my own view is that while these candidates would be OK, they are not superstars (like the person we are losing).  Mark 
 Stanford:  My only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the exchange consents - that would mean changing the date to September 7, 2000 at the end of the sentence.  Otherwise it all looks good to me.   I will forward everything on to Mark Holsworth for his final review - particularly with respect to the affiliates issue.  Thanks very much for your help in getting this done.  Mark 
 Mark:  Here is the most recent draft of the Reuters document.  You will see that while they didn't give us everything we asked for, they made significant progress on the indemnity.  I'm not sure they have satisfied your concern regarding the Enron affiliates issues - they have added in subsidiaries in several places but refused to change the definition of "Distributor" to include affiliates.  If you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through (to see all of the marked changes) let me or Dave Samuels know and we can forward them to you (I think there were at least 4 versions since the draft we discussed with them the other day).  Since I will be in Brazil on Monday, it might make sense for you to coordinate your reactions with Dave.  If you need me, please leave a voice-mail or ask  my assistant (Taffy x57373) to track me down.  Mark 
 Hi Dave:  Thanks for your note!  It's hard to believe that Washington House was over twenty years ago now.  I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law school in Michigan.  My first job after graduating was for a law firm in Houston.  They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to help out.  The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total.  One of those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong. I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues. We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit periodically.  I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping them get some products ready to trade online.  I get back to Washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 11th & 12th.  I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C. from time to time.  Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for American Century.  I was on the Alumni Board for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch very well.  There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations.  And I understand there are big plans for more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library. Enrollment is up above 1000.  Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well! There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look.  I guess we really did learn something while we were there.  Let me know if you ever get to Texas.  It would be fun to get together and catch up.  Mark Taylor 1322 Rutland St. Houston, TX 77008 (713)863-7190(home) (713)853-7459(work)
