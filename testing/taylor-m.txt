 Regarding Louise's second paragraph, I guess I had always assumed there would be different governing law provisions at a minimum - and dispute resolution fits similarly - with parties in various jurisdictions.  Any thoughts? 
 Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in them would apply to on-line trades.  The availability of the on-line system may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed. 
 I have not yet had a chance to read this but thought I should pass it along asap. 
 Here is another services agreement - this one used as a form by EES.

 Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook  FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are ``poised on the precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next, according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.  ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications:  Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak capacity requirements. Because demand growth is outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years. Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive year of above-average hydroelectric generation -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in 1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, the West will find itself at an even greater risk of price spikes. Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 2000, the result of both higher regional spot natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the value of ensuring reliability for consumers.  The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and highlights the following key results:  Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand growth is strong, creating a long-term regional capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region. Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices is for negative real growth through 2010, but the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is slowly added over the next few years. Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue to rise (but still remain below many other regions) as new, more efficient generation is added. Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by 2010, with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if any, real price appreciation through 2010.  ``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the other five regional volumes, offers comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from working one- on-one with the market's key players.''  About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook  ICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, an authoritative assessment of North American regional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respected consulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project due diligence evaluations for the North American electric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is available for six regional markets -- West, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada -- well as a National Subscription, which includes the six regional studies and a North American summary volume.

 Justin,  I note that the ETA has been revised to include a paragraph which provides that Enron's electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation.  Is that how we want this to work?  In the telephone trading context we assume that the executed confirmation will control over the oral conversation, even when we have a recording of the conversation.  Mark 
 Sorry - I'll be in NYC that weekend and I believe that's T's big swim meet in Atlanta.  But thanks for the offer! 
 I'm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or not - can't wait to hear the details  Yes, it was a fun weekend - we were in Austin.  T. swimming at the Lake and I stayed around the hotel using the gym and getting a massage.  Good food, too.  The only downer was the drive. 
 Darlene:  I'm busy on Thursday but Friday looks good.  Mark 
 Our meeting for this morning will have to be canceled due to scheduling conflicts.  Please make every effort to reserve this time slot (first and third Wednesdays at 10:00) in the future for our group meetings. 
 Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms - including the Omnibus Annex A.  Please give some thought to whether there are any other revisions we should make at this time.  We make every effort to minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many necessary changes made at this time as possible.  Mark 
 I currently have a 28800 modem but would like to get the fastest (within reason) modem we have available for a Compaq LTE 5280.  Please let me know if this is the kind of thing I can get by Friday since I leave for London Friday afternoon and would like to take the computer (complete with modem) with me. If the new modem is not available in that time frame, I at least need a new pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken.  Thanks and please charge 413/1157.  Mark Taylor x37459 
 The current versions are all the way at the bottom. 
 Here is the current version.  The numbers on the Annex have been deleted. 
 Hey Tim -  Thanks for the note - I needed a smile today.  I've been extremely busy and am leaving this afternoon for another trip to our London office.  Were you able to make any headway with the Bank regarding the NY house?  I just wondered if Greg had been able to help at all.  Mark 
 One more try...... 
 One more try...... 
 Hi Marc -  I just got back from London last night.  Looks like our IT people found out about this yesterday too - don't know if it hit us or not but they made everybody log off & back on again during the day yesterday - I'm assuming that was to install a new virus shield.  Didn't affect me since I wasn't here anyway.  How've you been?  MT 
 Does this make sense to you? 
 Has Louise mentioned anything about this to you?  What are we supposed to do with it? 
 We're home this weekend - might go sailing (you're welcome to come if you want) but nothing big planned.  I'm in NYC next Wed - Sun., T's in a swim meet in Atlanta next weekend, NYC after that.  Nothing planned for the 26/27 weekend & still toying with the idea of Seattle for the 4th. 
 Here's a very rough draft of a set of slides we might use.  Let me know if this is even close to what you have in mind.  I can have one of our paralegals and our graphics dept. fill in whatever we need and make it look good tomorrow.  Mark 
 Attached is the form of schedule to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement we use for purely financial transactions - swaps and options.  There are a large number of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and negotiating from here.  To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.  I'm not sure they will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I suspect you need.  If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.  When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from commodity to commodity.  I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms. In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).  If your situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic changes to these forms might be in order.  With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent that they don't even use forms as such.  I will ask Julia Murray to contact you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk about those types of transactions.  Unfortunately, I don't know of an electronic table of contents to the forms.  There is a project underway to create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought.

 I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.  If not, would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?

 I've been working the whole time - no vacation or sick time to report. 
 Here's a revised draft. 
 Alison:  Kevin & I are putting the final touches on our presentation - will we be able to have a projector for a computer/powerpoint presentation?  Mark 
 Yes, we would like to use the PowerPoint presentation.  Sorry for the last minute request.  If it's a big problem, I might be able to get our graphics dept. to turn it into 35mm slides.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I think this has already been sent to you.  Just wondering, though, why this is being lumped together in one complex transaction instead of splitting it into two. 
 Both of those times work for me. 
 I have my Wine Country book here at the office today but don't know where to send it - if you're in Houston I can have a messenger bring it to you.  Mark 
 Here are the powerpoint slides for our presentation tomorrow.  Kevin should be sending you some additional pages that are not part of the slides but that we would like to hand out.  See you tomorrow!  Mark 
 Louise - I'm already booked for Friday morning (including a 10:30 at S&C) - hopefully I can get a download from Justin & Scott on Monday.     Invitation Chairperson: Louise Kitchen  Start: 06/18/99 08:30 AM End: 06/18/99 10:00 AM  Description: Meeting to discuss CC's Foreign Jurisdiction Report - London 2:30 / New York 9:30    This meeting repeats   starting on    (if the date occurs on a weekend the meeting ). Meeting Dates:    Justin Boyd/LON/ECT Scott Sefton/LON/ECT Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT  Detailed description: 
 Sylvia:  I have been unable to reach either Jeff Keeler or Maureen McVicker to talk about this today.  I'm a little worried about who is handling the Commissioner's itinerary at this point and I don't know if anyone has reserved a conference room for the 2:30 meeting.  Fred Lagrasta is now also supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know if he needs any audio/visual equipment).  Can you check on this - maybe somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office will know where this is supposed to take place?  It is entirely possible that no one has reserved a room yet.  If you could do that and then let the attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.  Unfortunately, I'm on my way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself.  Thanks for your help!  Mark T. 
 Jeff:  In preparation for his meetings with Commissioner Newsome and Congressman Stenholm, Mark H. has asked for  information including a bullet point list of our key issues and any appropriate background material.  I have prepared a draft issues list which is attached.  Would you please take a quick look at it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it on to Mark?  He probably also needs the final itineraries.  Thanks for your help.  Mark T. 
 I hope ours looks better than this:  http://www.unioncal.com/ 
 sorry about that - misdirected to you. 
 could you please look into this? 
 I have revised the relevant experience paragraph slightly (if you open the attachment using "Launch" you can see the changes highlighted).  Kim, if this is OK with you please go ahead and use it. 
 I can certainly be available for a portion of that time - can you tell me the purpose of the call? 
 Hi Debbie:  Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!  I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy company (Enron).  I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce which is relatively new.  The most fun work project I've had was being the lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading platform about a year ago.  It has been tremendously successful.  While few people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in the world!  I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international mutual funds in New York.  My work takes me there several times a year and I usually try to see him if I have some free time.  The college is thinking about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).  Ralph V. was there - whom I hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.  I was on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.  There were only 2 of us from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see familiar faculty faces.  With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.  My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a terrible commute.  I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.  I rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me know if you ever make it down this way.  Mark 
 Sure - it's not secret.    Tana Jones 12/12/2000 09:12 AM 
 Generally speaking we have only documented that kind of concern when there were separate legal entities involved (like getting a comfort letter or guaranty from EI when ECT had to do the swap for one of their deals).  I think we can get away with pointing out the issue to both commercial sides.    Mary Cook 12/14/2000 03:30 PM 
 Did you get this? 
 Peter -  Should Tana add you to her list of people who get the daily EnronOnline customer list?  She sends it out to several lawyers to see if there is any reason not to give access to the system.  Mark    Peter Keohane Sent by: Sharon Crawford 12/14/2000 11:09 AM 
 Thanks for the e-mail - I tried to go in and update my info but the system is down and will be down all weekend.  Is Monday early enough? 
 Thanks for the number.  I did not get the cooking set for Elena - I ordered the bongo drum. 
 I spoke with Justin briefly this morning - he wants to look into this and get back to me.    Lisa Lees 12/19/2000 05:38 PM 
 Thanks! 
 Thanks - I've asked Sara to give him a call now, too.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 12/20/2000 11:51 AM 
 I am on Continental Express Flight 4100 from Houston to Cincinnati Depart: Houston (IAH), 23-Dec-00 at 11:00 AM Arrive: Cincinnati (CVG), 23-Dec-00 at  2:26 PM  My flight on Tuesday is the same as at Thanksgiving: leaving Cincinnati at 3:00.

 Yes, I think we were ok with the base language - it was just those last issues we were waiting on.    Greg Johnston 01/02/2001 03:34 PM 
 Why don't you come in Saturday night & I'll take you to dinner? 
 I did get Janet the white top (Interlock turtleneck - Medium, color - white #A32027)  from Talbots.  It was the fleece vest that they didn't have in the stores.  I did not get the towels.  Glad the computer is working better for you.  It makes all the difference in the world to have it speed up.  For me it actually becomes more useful since I cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to happen.  My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.  I wonder if people grow them outdoors when the weather warms up.  The smell might work better with more room to disperse.  This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I can stand it!  Love,  Mark 
 I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange Act issues. 
 That's fine.  We don't keep particularly careful track of these things but pretty much estimate the percentages on a quarterly basis.    Francisco Pinto Leite@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/03/2001 04:13 PM

 Looks good to me.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 01/04/2001 08:31 AM

 Elizabeth Sager, who is responsible for power trading documentation in North America and was in large part responsible for drafting the Industrial Master several years ago, is reviewing the proposed form.  She will have comments for us by Monday morning, Houston time. 
 I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!  I don't remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket.  Bummer - looks like I'll just have to be the wimp this time.  There's really no way I can get away next week.  I have heard of las ventanas - but I didn't know about the evian spritzing.  Maybe next time.  Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?  I could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister...... 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of the office construction process will begin in just over a week.  That means it is finally time to move into your new offices.  Taffy Milligan will be submitting the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move. 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of the office construction project will begin in a little over a week.  There is good news and bad news.  First the bad: the office which you currently occupy will be in the next construction phase.    Now the good:  it looks like we will probably have a place for you to sit until your new office is ready. Taffy Milligan will submit the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move. 
 That's a great idea - I'll see if I can line up a boat - anywhere in particular you'd like to sail?  (BVI makes sense if there's a newcomer along.)  Where do you fly into to get to Charlottesville?    "Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com> 01/04/2001 07:20 PM

 Approved. 
 We can try - an we'll ask the planners to put that in the design.  But Mark H. has indicated a desire to get rid of as many of the tall walls as possible and he approves all of the construction requests personally, so we may not succeed.    Suzanne Adams 01/05/2001 12:10 PM

 You might find the attached of interest.  I fear it is time to consider the S&C memorandum we discussed at our first meeting in New York. 
 Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit?    Russell Diamond 01/05/2001 05:20 PM 
 Seems to me that L/C's are the way to go then, rather than asking for cash or another asset as collateral.  (Another option would be to mix and match - taking cash up to $10 mil. and L/C's beyond that.)   Lenders frequently set up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control over how much "debt" is supported by the asset base while still giving the borrower some flexibility.  As you can imagine, most other extenders of credit are willing to take the bank's L/C in lieu of a lien on a hard asset.    Russell Diamond 01/08/2001 06:42 PM

 Nora - I got your voice mail & will try to call you soon - I'm stuck on a conference call.  I tend to agree with you - this seems to me to be contrary to our policy.

 There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the internet trading language in the confirm they generate? 
 Here are some early drafts I worked on. 
 Re: assistant searches, I think you would be well advised to coordinate closely with Janette Elbertson. 
 I have a conflict with the Friday morning call this week.  Any chance you will be covering it?  I know you guys are busy this week..... 
 I'll let you know when I figure out what our Firm ID and Password are. 
 I just heard that there is a farewell party for Rainer on Friday afternoon - don't know any details. 
 Ohmygawd!  An e-mail message from Hal!  Now I know we really ARE in the 21st century.  I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and don't need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.  Ted will get there Friday eve.  I have meetings during the days Thursday & Friday and Sat. morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.  Otherwise I don't think we have specific plans.  Looking forward to it!  Mark 
 Sounds good to me - let's say dinner on Thursday and then either lunch or dinner - your choice - including Ted on Saturday.  We have no plans at all so far so we're flexible.  Mark 
 Tana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation after it is executed.  There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a patch-work of policies created by the operating units.  Tana and I would be happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind. 
 I see what you mean - the GTC's get attached to the confirms when they are sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are different. 
 Linda said she had an extra room booked - do I need to call the hotel directly or work through Linda?    "Andrea Williams" <AWILLIAM@skadden.com> 01/18/2001 05:50 PM 
 Peter  Welcome to Enron!  I usually get to the London office a couple of times a year and will look forward to meeting you there.  If not, hopefully we'll see you at the Law Conference in the Spring.  Most of your e-mail is well outside my area of expertise.  Are you consulting me regarding the regulatory issues and section 10.2?  If so, it would help if you told me what 10.2 says.....  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss.  Mark    Peter Traung@ENRON 01/18/2001 01:51 PM 
 Hey Jim,  Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.  Let us know when you find a place to live  Mark 
 try userid EOL67313 password WELCOME! 
 Hal  I hope you have access to e-mail in KW.  I'm down with the flu so we won't be able to make it.  I was really looking forward to this for a number of reasons - including the chance to get together with you.  I didn't have your phone number or e-mail address at home so I had a friend drop my work computer off on his way home tonight.  I've left a message for Don at home - sorry about late notice.  Mark 
 shouldn't the people who need filing cabinets order them for themselves?    Taffy Milligan 01/18/2001 09:37 AM 
 You are set to move as soon as the current construction phase is completed - we hope that will be by March 1. 
 In case you need to know.... 
 I may have missed it, but a VERY quick look at CNN's site showed no reports of computer virus activity since November.    "Taylor, Timothy G Mr HJF" <Timothy.Taylor@APG.AMEDD.ARMY.MIL> 01/26/2001 03:42 PM 
 Very good question - while you don't need to worry about otc swaps, otc options might be a problem.  However, if the customer is not a US entity, the advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there would be a problem. 
 Not sure why you weren't on this distribution.... 
 Can you follow up with Anthony Dayao? 
 I should be down for sick time for Mon. through Thurs. last week.    Holly Keiser@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/29/2001 07:46 AM 
 Works for me.    Lisa Yoho@ENRON 01/29/2001 01:32 PM 
 In case the Four Seasons doesn't work out, there are two other hotels downtown you might consider:  The Stephen F. Austin (an Intercontinental I think) and the Driskill.  Both are old (by U.S. standards) hotels that have been updated.  For several years after its renovation the Driskill was the nicest place in town - then came the Four Seasons.  The Stephen F. Austin was just completely redone a year or so ago - I haven't been inside but I hear they did a nice job.  Both are primarily business hotels so they may have good weekend rates. 
 Sounds good to me.    Lisa Yoho@ENRON 01/29/2001 02:31 PM 
 Still available?    Janette Elbertson 01/30/2001 09:11 AM 
 FYI 
 Looks good to me!

 I'm very flexible on who comes along - no views at all on that score.  It would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so we can book the correct size boat.  You can always change the amount of groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved.  I called Keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra room - it looks great from the website.  Will you be golfing or should we make massage appointments?  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure which days we have reserved - another alternative might be to stay near DC on the day we get back from sailing (Inn at Little Washington?).  My guess is it's an all day affair getting from a little island to DC so we may get in pretty late.  Tell Amanda I said Hi! 
 Very funny - although I have to say I thought yours was the least humorous of the bunch. 
 Fred - Here is a draft NDA - you will need to fill in the address for the customer.      Fred Philipson/ENRON@enronXgate 02/02/2001 11:55 AM

 The EnronOnline team has asked if we can discontinue sending copies of the GTC's when EnronOnline transactions are confirmed.  They have suggested a sentence be added to the confirmation to the effect that it is subject to the GTC's which can be accessed on the website.  Any thoughts? 
 I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way.  Maybe if you can give me a little more detail I could help. 
 As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the last several months.  While so far we have been able to find places for everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file cabinet space on the floor.  In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.  Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.  Once we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to allocate the available file cabinet space.  Most if not all of us will have to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we each reduce our file space usage to our fair share. 
 Apparently my first attempt wasn't delivered to you guys.  Sorry about that. 
 Sheri -  I'm not sure this is an issue for me.  Aren't you in Lance's group now?  Mark     Sheri L Cromwell 02/06/2001 02:08 PM 
 Here is another draft from the business guys. 
 Janette - Can you give us the straight scoop? 
 There is a master agreement in place between ECT and Koch Energy Trading, Inc.  I have never heard of Koch Carbon.  My immediate concern is as to the Enron entity.  It is not clear to me why Peter thinks this trade is between ECT and a Koch entity since he does not have authority to bind ECT. 
 Ken:  I have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an Africa project.  Of course, I have no idea how any of my time gets charged to any project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide.  In any event, if it is my time, it is clearly there in error.  Is there any detail describing what I am supposed to have done during those hours?  That might help me redirect the errant time to  where it belongs.  There used to be another Mark E. Taylor at Enron.  He worked for EI and was based in London.  Any chance this is his time?  Mark 
 I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.  She relates the following points:  Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for the new building generally While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent earlier (e.g. organizational and technology changes) Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing this work for the legal department  Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk about how you want to move forward. 
 Tana - Do we have NDAs in place with the following companies that would cover discussions with them concerning wireless connectivity for EnronOnline?  Agent Go Aether Systems JP Systems Luminant Lante Outercurve Tibco 
 Do we have our other desired changes incorporated at this point?    Carol St Clair 02/08/2001 04:24 PM 
 I hope you've had the VCR going. 
 Any thoughts? 
 Sounds good to me.    Carol St Clair 02/09/2001 04:42 PM 
 Looks like I will NOT be able to have my cell phone on during our meetings - but here is the number if you need to get a message to me. 
 Have a good time! 
 Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that would be ok. 
 FYI 
 fyi 
 FYI 
 When we meet this afternoon I'd also like to discuss the Canadian traders using EnronOnline average prices as an index for financial trades. 
 Apparently this came yesterday but I didn't see it since it didn't come directly from David.  Sorry about that. 
 Yes, I'm planning to be on the call.    Chris Long@ENRON 02/15/2001 10:01 AM 
 This looks like a pretty good list.  My suggestions would be to substitute Elizabeth Sager for Leslie Hansen who is on maternity leave and to add Denis O'Connell in London for credit derivatives.    Vanessa Schulte@ENRON 02/05/2001 05:21 PM 
 fyi 
 No problem - I'm glad we go it straightened out.  Do you do any work with Yao Apasu in Legal?  Yao & I go way back. 
 Please arrange for the promotion for Sara Shackleton from Sr. Counsel to Asst. General Counsel effective March 1, 2001. 
 This was the last e-mail from Leslie on the topic.  We talked afterwards and I thought she was going to talk to Andy about this but never heard back. 
 Vikas -  Thanks for your note.  Enron does have a policy that somewhat restricts the trading that may be done by employees - even when they are not involved in a trading function.  No Enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for their own account (or for the account of another) which Enron trades.  The only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities - and there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for Enron. This policy is modified from time to time by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors and is monitored by the Risk Assessment and Control Group.  I believe Cassandra Schultz currently has that responsibility.  I am sending her a copy of this e-mail (so in case I have misrepresented the policy in some way, Cassandra please correct me) and if you need any further information, please contact her.  Mark    Vikas Dwivedi@ENRON 02/20/2001 04:08 PM 
 Gentlemen:  Several points regarding the below:  We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time. If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone in my group to get that process started. The e-mail from Dow indicates: "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the confirmations sent by Enron." All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them should stop immediately on legal grounds. The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone here have it?  Let's hope it works out better this time.  Mark    John Viverito@ENRON 02/20/2001 01:55 PM 
 All four look fine to me. 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 I think the "Wes" we were looking for the other day may be Wes Colwell who I think may be in charge of accounting for ENA.  If not, maybe somebody on this list will know something about FAS133. 
 Sounds good to me.    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/22/2001 09:41 AM 
 Looks good to me.  Please make sure Holly puts it on the group calendar.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 02/22/2001 09:01 AM 
 Yes, a standard presentation that shows generally what traders see when they use the system would be good.  We should definitely avoid being too technical.    Lisa Yoho@ENRON 02/22/2001 02:55 PM 
 They don't have the exclusive line (brand new) boat for our week but they do have this one.  If you can get in the night before we can actually stay on the boat and leave early in the morning - effectively getting an extra day of sailing.  If you want to check it out online, their website is www.moorings.com and the boat is a 463.  There's some good stuff on the site for people who've never been before - Bill might find it comforting. 
 I have taken a stab at a Legal & Privacy Statement for the Broker version of EnronOnline.  Please take a look and let me know what you think.  Justin - I don't know if or when they expect to launch something like this in Europe but I expect it won't be long.  Mark G. has been working on the Broker version of the ETA (the "BETA") and a Fee Agreement which we can send along. 
 Subj. test 
 Please take a few minutes to select your reviewers for the mid-year performance review process and enter them in the Performance Management System so that we can move this process along.  Thanks!  Mark 
 Many changes. 
 Here's my stab. 
 Approved. 
 Becky - please take Mark Haedicke off of the distribution list for this meeting.    Becky Spencer 02/27/2001 09:15 AM 
 Stephanie:  This is like a very complicated game of musical chairs.  Right now there ar= e=20 people in the offices that have been designated for Michelle and Gail.  We= =20 can't move you guys in until we move them out.  We can't move them out yet= =20 because we don't have any more places to move people!

 Approved 
 I'm in all week - just give me a call.    Lisa Yoho@ENRON 02/27/2001 02:09 PM 
 We are trying to decide what to do this weekend and wondered (with fond memories of last year in mind) what you guys had planned..... 
 Approved.  Do we have extra monitors/keyboards already on the floor? 
 Any idea how I should handle this? 
 Just wanted to make sure you had received this. 
 Just wanted to say hello.  I hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how things were going.  Have you moved out of the hotel yet?  I know how depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.  Even though the hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very nice, it was still just a hotel room.  I was so glad to get out of there into an apartment - major quality of life improvement.  We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.   Ted wants to leave town to do something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday. Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft. Lauderdale is even too high for Ted.  Ted's brother is working on a  project here in town so we had him over the other night for dinner.  Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.  How do you just forget something like that?  Luckily they went to the gym ahead of time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and bought his brother a steak on the way home.  That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty much the whole thing has been given back.  I'm still going to buy a new car - looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.  Hope you are doing well!  Mark 
 The cruise is a western Caribbean cruise on a Carnival Lines ship - leaving from Galveston on the 17th.  I'm actually looking forward to it.  I may not be partying with the best of them (or have a body that would entitle me to even try) but a week in warm weather in a deck chair with a good book and a waiter bringing tropical drinks is sounding really good right now.  As for Europe, Ted is thinking London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Finland, Iceland and Norway (think blond and English speaking).  Personally, I'm reasonably flexible, but I'd rather go biking or barging through the wine country in France or relaxing in a Tuscan hill town or villa than disco-hopping through another Scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in London.  Berlin, Prague and Budapest appeal since I've never been to any of them.  Or maybe I can get over to Barcelona just before your cruise with Ted - maybe with a few days in the wine country or Madrid beforehand? 
 FYI 
 Every time I try to go to the "next step" and choose a hotel room type I get the hotel selection for the Sonoma weekend instead of whichever trip I'm looking at. 
 I would be interested in your thoughts. 
 Let's talk at our group meeting tomorrow about the changes we should be making to our forms based on the CFMA and our conversation with Ken Raisler. 
 Wow - I suppose it might be mine but I have no idea what it is!    Mark A Taylor@EES 03/07/2001 07:05 AM

 My guess is this was a holdover from last year's list.    Brent Hendry@ENRON 03/07/2001 07:53 AM 
 Ann Ballard in the Corp. legal dept. called me about these guys today.  You might check with her to see where things stand.    Vladimir Gorny/ENRON@enronXgate 03/06/2001 07:58 PM 
 This is one I did for steel.  It should probably be beefed up to include reference to an ISDA master to be signed up front. 
 Here's one Carol did. 
 FYI 
 We think the HoustonStreet disclaimer is not just overkill but entirely unnecessary.  And I plan to remind all of you of this the next time you claim the Enron lawyers are too conservative! 
 FYI. 
 OK    Brent Hendry@ENRON 03/12/2001 09:25 AM 
 I think this is probably OK.  You should probably just check with Samantha & Tana to make sure they aren't planning something then.  Since it is Good Friday, it might be a little slower than usual.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 03/12/2001 08:17 AM 
 Greg:  It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and calls.  So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.  On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already covers the treatment of holidays:  ...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the preceding business day)...  which makes the deleted language redundant.

 If they can figure out a way to do it, more power to them - but there are only just so many characters available in the short description line.    Greg Johnston 03/12/2001 02:18 PM 
 I wish I could - unfortunately I will be out of town on vacation next week. Thanks for asking!    Alan Aronowitz 03/12/2001 06:25 PM 
 I'm not sure if Carol's request ever made it to you - she is asking for a flat panel monitor - approved. 
 Thanks for your note - here is the form.  I think we should be able to find someone internally so let's at least try that first. 
 I have canceled my earlier plans so I have a lot of flexibility now.  If my preference enters into the equation, I would say 2 or 6 August would be perfect (I could tack a holiday on to one end or the other) but I recognize that may be too late. 
 Mary - here are the confirms I mentioned.  Mike - can you send us a red-lined version from the original Annex A form? 
 Let's look at the internal candidates first.    Molly Magee/ENRON@enronXgate 03/13/2001 03:42 PM 
 It's OK to open AIG Energy Trading Inc. for US financial gas & power. 
 I'll be out the 26th but in the 27th - the afternoon would probably be better for me since it will be my first day back after vacation.    Sami Arap@ENRON 03/14/2001 08:45 AM 
 OK    Lisa Lees 03/13/2001 03:39 PM 
 Thought you might be interested in this message that went out to all Enron= =20 employees. 
 That works for me - Brent & I are both on 38 - my office is 3892.    Sami Arap@ENRON 03/14/2001 10:57 AM 
 Sorry for the delay - the general rule is that we will pay for a reasonable usage plan (huge numbers of minutes don't count as reasonable) but the phone itself is your own.    Keegan Farrell@ENRON 03/05/2001 09:01 AM 
 I don't think we should take this at face value -  company the size of Sunoco should be able to use an ISDA. 
 I guess it looks OK to me.  I'm surprised that they will have the ability to identify their own company as a counterparty.  Don't we limit the companies they can designate to those already signed up to trade on EnronOnline?    David Forster@ENRON 03/15/2001 08:19 AM 
 FYI 
 Marcus -  I understand you are the new physical power online lawyer - lucky you! Here's one that the EOL people are anxious to get covered.  I'd be happy to sit down and go over exactly what all this means and you'll probably want to talk to Tana a bit as well.  Mark 
 Shari Stack has resigned but Marcus Nettelton has been appointed to take over from the physical power side.  I'll sit down with him today and get him up to speed.    Andy Zipper/ENRON@enronXgate 03/15/2001 09:02 AM 
 I think the "sm" is their attempt to designate "enymex" as a service mark. 
 Jim will fill in when Tom isn't here - I'll figure out a way to get him the key, etc. 
 The next step is for Chad to contact the Credit Group in RAC.  They will do the credit analysis and send a  credit worksheet to the Swap Group paralegals who will prepare the first draft, run it by a lawyer and get it ready for the customer.    John Viverito@ENRON 03/15/2001 11:21 AM 
 I tend to agree with you, but Nora Dobin is the lawyer who knows the most about the DealBench system - you should probably check with her.    Chris Gaffney 03/15/2001 01:37 PM 
 I have the feeling that Koch finally decided to consolidate their financial trading with us into Koch Energy Trading.  They recently did a trade with our coal desk between ECT and Koch Carbon Inc.  Do we have a contact in legal (or elsewhere) at Koch we should call to see if they are willing to use Koch Energy Trading? 
 Looks good to me. 
 I suggest you work through Matthew Dawson in the London legal department. They should be able to help you.    Angeline Poon 03/16/2001 12:22 AM 
 I will be on vacation from Monday the 19th through Monday the 26th (returning to the office on Tuesday the 27th).  My cell phone and pager will not work either at sea or in the countries I will be visiting.  I can be reached via Maritime Communications Network at (877)225-7447 - you will need to give my name and the name of the ship - Celebration.  Since the rates are around $10 per minute, I don't plan to check my voicemail as often as usual but will call in when in port. 
 I don't know anything about the Daishowa transaction but have to wonder why this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related to EnronOnline.  To the extent we can't avoid disclosing it, I would think that the traders in Calgary will know how many of them trade using the system.  If that doesn't work I would try Savita Puthigai (x31787) or David Forster (x31861) on the EnronOnline team.    Peter Keohane 03/16/2001 11:36 AM 
 David -  I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but thought I ought to send it on to you.  I will be out of the office (vacation) until the 27th and didn't want to lose the entire week.  Mark  ps - I lost all of my voice mails the other day and I think there was one from you regarding a possible conflict - my understanding is that we're just assigning a bunch of transactions over from one party to another and in that case I tend to think there's no problem. 
 I have not yet done the performance reviews for several people in the group. They are due by the 28th.  Please schedule 45 min. for me with each of Sara, Mary, Brent, Carol and Bob Bruce on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning. 
 I'll certainly take them if nobody else does.    Janette Elbertson 03/28/2001 05:10 PM 
 I hadn't heard from you in a while - just wondered how you were. 
 http://www.clubcherry.net/html/masterframe.html 
 Any chance you're attending again this year?  It would be nice to catch up. 
 Kevin Meredith@ENRON 04/02/2001 10:42 AM 
 I highlighted the items I am concerned about (hard copy in your tray) - please check and make sure they make sense for us to pay.    Holly Keiser@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/02/2001 05:35 PM 
 Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions: Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest? If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.    Peter Keohane 04/02/2001 07:02 PM 
 Yes - Thanks! 
 Thanks for the message back - I'll see you Friday! 
 How does this process usually start? 
 I think it's a nice idea.    Mary Cook 04/10/2001 10:25 AM 
 Chris -  Looks OK to me.    Chris Walker 04/11/2001 01:49 PM 
 Sorry about that Vance - I just missed it.  I don't see any problems here either.    Vance Meyer@ENRON 04/12/2001 04:29 PM 
 Erica -  I have no legal objections to the presentation.  I do have to wonder if it is wise from a commercial perspective to so heavily emphasize the importance of the success of EnronOnline to the company's business on the platform itself.  Mark 
 Here's a draft of the bullet points you requested: 
 I found this on a sailing magazine web page:  An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful, life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends without any interfering presence from myself.  I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving such a letter and her interesting reply was, "I get about 20,000 letters per year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent him from accepting." So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying "I accept your kind offer with perhaps obscene haste." As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995 that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. His host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic manner.  The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr. O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil.  After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise.  I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots?  As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht. ? In May 1995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up. Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes, pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology, medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work.  The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit and his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver, short-changing him on his yachting holiday.  Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind, the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but thankfully this never occurred.  Before dinner O'Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with relish. All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the center of the talk and controlled its direction totally. I found the level of sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had ever experienced, and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I was left far behind. My MIT engineer's degree had, alas, not prepared me for cultivated discourse at such a level. It was literally exhausting, but a marvel to follow.  The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca. O'Brian suggested that we sail (sail, not motor) into the long narrow channel leading to the port of Mahon, the location of the first meeting between Aubrey and Maturin. This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda's size, but I carried it off, happily, without mishap. We had an interesting afternoon ashore with O'Brian showing us about the old city with intense enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan, the local tongue. That evening, while at dinner back aboard the yacht, he suggested for the first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me.  And so our cruise continued, with Patrick showing keen interest in everything; we fished with some success; we sailed every day; we visited the port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands of sea birds. Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character Stephen Maturin, who is clearly modeled on Patrick's physique and personality. ? One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal. It started with Patrick asking me if I had heard of a place, Indiana, and a school, the University of Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible? The University's English department had purchased (and not yet paid for) two or three of Patrick's manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O'Brian which Patrick found intensely offensive. Patrick then mentioned that he was destroying all of his diaries, his journals and all of his correspondence so that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels.  Richard Ollard was aghast, and Ms. Green was very upset with this quite startling revelation. Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso's letters when he had written a well-received biography of the artist.  Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him, but that he, Patrick, could not rely upon the goodwill of "some post-doctoral American fool." So the tension-filled discussion continued. The analogy of an artist framing his painting was raised; it was then complete and should not require either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist's frame of mind at the time of creation.  Now, after Patrick's death, we understand some of his thinking. He was his own construct, born Patrick Russ, English not Irish, not university educated, not a sailor, a father who abandoned his family, and altogether a piece of his own fiction. But, that night aboard Andromeda, only Mary knew the truth and understood his deep motives.  The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine Mediterranean weather. While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in light wind, with our centerboard keel raised and guided by - as it turned out - an inaccurate Spanish chart, we decided to sail between the coast and a small island, and we ran firmly aground in shallow water. In the Med one can't simply wait for a higher tide, so we emptied all our fresh water tanks and tried to back off. No luck. I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk with compressed air, over ten tons. Still no luck. Finally, we tied a long hawser to a rock astern and, using our anchor windlass to bar-tight tension, we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster. Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations. He nearly believed, I thought, that we had arranged the event for his entertainment.  One morning at breakfast, after our friendship had become more firmly established, Patrick said, "Tom, I wish to ask you an embarrassing question which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern world. What is software?" My answer, "The piano is the hardware and the sheet music is the software," satisfied him and upon reflection, myself as well.  Every afternoon between two and five, Patrick retired to my on-board office to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral, then in progress. He borrowed the yacht's charts of France, particularly the area around Brest, to incorporate detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book. Very much to Mary's surprise he showed me each day's progress. She said that he had never shared his work with anyone before completion. Later, Patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I treasure.  Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business required that all of Patrick's guests and I depart. He and Mary continued on to Ibiza with the yacht's crew for three further days, mostly to study that island's renowned bird colonies. Then they sailed, uneventfully, back to Port Vendres.  My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year. We corresponded. He and Mary stayed in my home. They were aboard my schooner Mariette. We met at his club, Brooks, in London. He was a genius and his books remain a towering, towering achievement. I miss him greatly. - tom perkins belvedere  This story was reprinted from the August 2000 issue of Latitude 38.

 Bill -  If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty. Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.  In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.  Mark 
 Harry - are you the right lawyer to look at this? 
 Thanks Bill - appreciate your help!    Bill D Hare 04/16/2001 05:51 PM 
 Doc -  I'll be in town through Sunday morning.  Any chance we can get together for dinner Saturday eve.?  Mark 
 Thanks Doc - sounds like fun - see you Saturday! 
 Paul -  Sorry for the delay.  I see no problems with this in the current format. There might be an issue if the description of the product included the word COMEX or any other trademark of the exchange.  I'm not too concerned about the presence of "COMEX" in the long description since presumably that will not appear on Reuters.  Mark T.    Paul Goddard@ENRON 04/18/2001 05:51 AM 
 I'm not sure if this document was one of the ones we sent to you earlier but it may be useful to have  around. 
 That's probably OK - just a little further into the gray.  The main concern is that we not be "marketing" the product with reference to the exchange - in our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description - an example of what would not work would be describing the product as a "COMEX lookalike" or something similar.    Paul Goddard@ENRON 04/19/2001 09:08 AM 
 Bill -  Sorry for the delay -- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just got your message this morning.  Don't worry about sailing skills.  Among the rest of us we have that pretty well covered.  We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any serious damage.  We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in the world to sail around for a few days.  Navigation is easy (you can always see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to handle).  The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking & socializing) are in fact the critical skills for a trip like this.  We sure don't want anyone on board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!  If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website -- www.moorings.com. Under "Destinations" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.  Under "Charter Fleet" we'll be on a Moorings 463.  Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information. I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the airport.  About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food and drinks.  Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda & I will take care of most of that.  Any particular beverage requests?  Beer, wine, liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?  And finally, just a bit if extra info:  1.  Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.  We will have a local cell phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.  If you need to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in Tortola (284)494-2332.  They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if a call comes in.  2.  A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you think you'll need.  US Dollars are the currency.  3.  You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.  4.  Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow  on the boat) and try to carry everything on -- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.  That's about all I can think of right now.  Feel free to ask any other questions.  I'm starting to get excited now too.  It's hard to believe it's less than 3 weeks away!  Mark     "McGovern, William" <McGovernW@SEC.GOV> 04/20/2001 09:55 AM 
 Please arrange. 
 I don't think I knew we were making a mid-week drop at the airport.  We need to remember that as we plan where we'll be. 
 No, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs trades in the relevant commodities.  In fact, we used that language to mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms when they first signed up for EnronOnline.  To the extent we want to eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their agreement.  From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally available......    Andy Zipper/ENRON@enronXgate 04/25/2001 08:41 AM 
 Bill,  Thanks for the info.  Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to get to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get there until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at 5:21).  It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending yours along?  Mark 
 Yes, silly me.  But just so there's some hope that Bill makes his flight back, we should plan on being in the general vicinity of Tortola on the day of his flight.  It turns out I need everybody's birthday and address.  I assume you're still at 200 W 86th but don't know your birthday.     "Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com> 04/25/2001 03:50 PM 
 I'm pretty sure this is going in across the board for US deals.  If you guys want to, I have no objection.  We came up with some language to insert into the first paragraph of the confirm indicating that it is subject to the GTC and incorporating it by reference.  Bob Bowen has the final version of the language (I think it varied slightly between various commodities).  Just as a 'heads up' we are also starting down the road of doing away with confirmations altogether for certain US EnronOnline transactions.  Maybe we should chat about that and I can give you all the details.  It's going to be a lengthy and painful process.    Greg Johnston 04/25/2001 09:51 AM 
 Some interesting articles in this one. 
 I'm not sure if you guys have seen this before or not.  Lousie seems to think that you are preparing the U.S. version of this. 
 Thanks for the credit card number - I'm sure it will come in handy some day. I was actually planning to pay for the Moorings portion of this as a graduation present.  Is that OK? 
 I need your birthday and address to finalize the info for the Moorings. Finals going OK? 
 Ken -  I have a question about the interpretation of this paragraph of the EnronOnline Legal & Privacy Statement.  Maybe we can talk about it when we talk about the clearing issue.  14.

By using this website, you expressly consent to Enron (1) using this information to assess the function and performance of this website, to assess the needs of its customers, to market Enron's products and services and for the other purposes set out in this paragraph 14, and (2) transferring this data to Enron subsidiaries throughout the world for the purposes specified in (1) above. Any information which you provide or which Enron otherwise obtains will be used solely by Enron and will not be sold or made available to third parties, with the exception of the third parties providing data processing or similar services to Enron, or in connection with Enron's provision or marketing of products and services to you. 
 Thanks for the info.  And I sure hear your --  especially re: crim pro!  On the evidence front, I did the same thing you did -- took it for bar purposes -- but I never cease to be amazed at how often it comes up in my non-litigator's practice.  So don't despair, it may yet be helpful.\  I'm really looking forward to sailing too.  Just two weeks!  Mark 
 Attached is a brief outline of the requirements for electronic trading facilities for transactions in exempt commodities.  Exempt commodities are all commodities other than financial commodities (e.g. interest rates, currencies, securities) and agricultural commodities. 
 I'm afraid I already have plans but thanks for the invite. 
 We have reservations with Eric, the golf pro, on Friday afternoon at 3:00. He thinks 4 or 5 holes will takes us 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  We don't have to play just holes 1 through 5 but can pick and choose -- based to some extent on where other people are playing.  Saturday afternoon you have a massage appointment at the club at 2:00 with a manicure/pedicure to follow at 3:00.  My massage is at 2:00.  Amanda decided not to participate since she will need to get ready for the party.  She is going to try and get lunch reservations for us all at Boar's Head for 11:45. 
 Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he would be with Amanda on Saturday.  We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done with golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your nails until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq and Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon. 
 Using your numbers: 1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to. 2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets. 3. Yes 4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.    David Forster/ENRON@enronXgate 04/27/2001 05:18 PM

 I had the pre-review meeting on my calendar for the 16th (10:00) and the final meeting for the 30th (1:30).  Has one of them changed?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.'  Since we needed something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the golf I went ahead and made the reservation that way.  The manicure was Amanda's idea.  Never having had one, I just assumed they dried them for you.  Would you rather have a facial?  I didn't ask about the morning.    "Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com> 04/30/2001 08:54 AM 
 Sorry to hear you're having computer problems.  I haven't gotten a virus yet but I have had 2 hard drives crash and burn on me -- one at home and one at the office -- you definitely loose everything when that happens!  My fairly new work computer (the little one you saw at Christmas) started making strange noises a couple of weeks ago so I called in the tech support guys. They agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive, replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one. Took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so I feel better.  I'm off to San Antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for sailing on the 11th, returning on the 21st.  The last few days (18 - 21) I'll be staying at a place called Keswick Hall in Virginia.  I may be able to send that number before I leave.  Love,  Mark 
 I thoroughly agree about tea -- if you can reschedule your manicure the timing would be perfect.  And you're right about Sunday afternoon too -- I'm sure by then we'll be ready for a rest.  Do we have plans for Sunday eve.? Do we care?    "Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com> 04/30/2001 10:04 AM

 Bill:  I am sending you by FedEx tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the cruising guide to the Virgin Islands.  It's not required reading but I thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be sailing.  Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have the most up to date information on navigation, restaurants, bars, etc. (you will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages - these are surprisingly useful).  There's a lot of information in there.  If you want to focus on just a few, the places we are (in my humble and easily overridden opinion) most likely to visit are:  Road Town - that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to be there The Bight on Norman Island - deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant, good snorkeling nearby Jost Van Dyke - we have always liked Sydney's Peace & Love in Little Harbor and Foxy's in Great Harbor Sandy Cay - the classic deserted island, very small - probably just a lunch or quick swim stop Cane Garden Bay - a little tricky  getting in but well worth it - the quintessential Caribbean beach (swath of white sand, palm trees, steel bands, etc.) Trellis Bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called The Last Resort Cooper Island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining option The Baths - wouldn't be a trip to the BVI without a stop here Bitter End Yacht Club - probably about as far as we'd want to go  There are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St. John but it is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and customs in the BVI, then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St. John and then back into the BVI when we go back over there.  Kind of a lot of trouble, particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it's impossible to find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in.  We've done it before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it.  Of course, we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at Caneel Bay (fancy resort) on St. John.  So stay tuned.  We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola (which probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St. John) the night before your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport.  One alternative is to stay at Trellis Bay - or right across at Marina Cay - that night and just dinghy you over to the dock - it's a 5 min. walk to the airport.  Or we can drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be called and the island just isn't that big - I don't think it could take more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other!  I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide.  They aren't that important unless you check bags.  Please be sure to use them if you check anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up with us some day.  I'm not sure, but it may also make it just a tad easier to get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags.  Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing: http://people.we.mediaone.net/gkunkel/bviphoto.htm http://www.b-v-i.com/  Call or e-mail with any questions.

 Since we will all be swamped trying to get out of here on time tomorrow, I think we should defer the group meeting.  I will be out of town on the 16th, so please check your calendars to see if 10:00 on the 9th will work as a substitute.

 As you already know, it's that time again.  Since I am leaving on vacation Friday morning, please use the system to input your suggested reviewers no later than noon tomorrow (Thursday) so that I can approve them and get the process started before I leave.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Mark 
 Can you please see if you can get me out of this?  I have to talk to Ken Raisler with Brent & Julia at 2 and with tomorrow being my last day before vacation it will no doubt be too hectic to do an interview. 
 She's right - there are a couple of high class resorts that require long pants and a collared shirt but we can easily avoid those.  The first few years we went sailing down there I always took long pants and even a sport coat "just in case."  The sport coat NEVER got used.  I usually wear a pair of khakis on the plane since they are sometimes cold and have used them a couple of times down there over the years but for the most part it's a tres casual part of the world. 
 p.s.  Did you get the cruising guide I sent? 
 Approved. 
 Glad you got the  package.  I view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the Peter Principle is in operation in my life.  I know how all the pieces move but I can't see more than one move ahead -- proving that I am basically an idiot and have advanced well beyond where I long ago should have maxed out professionally.

 Here is a first draft of an amendment agreement.  Please feel free to rip it to shreds. 
 Peter:  My only concerns would be:  (1) To the extent of any overlap in customers (which seems unlikely but it's happened here), we would want all of the transactions to be in the same entity for netting and setoff purposes. (2)  It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail financial transactions in Canada.  We are pretty restricted in that area in the US.  As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada. (3)  If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron Canada and ENA.  Let me know if I can be of any help.  Mark T.    Peter Keohane 05/09/2001 03:28 PM 
 All Delaware corporations are registered with the Secretary of State's office in Wilmington, Delaware.  Since that office is notoriously slow, if your counterparty is trying to get information on ECTRIC they might have better luck going through CT Corporation Systems, a company that is in the business of dealing with corporate information and issues which has access to the Delaware state records.  They have offices all over the place, including Wilmington.  Hope this is helpful.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 
 I don't have copies of any of the FASB pronouncements.  I suggest you find one of the accountants who handles these things.

 Sorry I haven't been able to respond.  I have been swamped trying to get away for a vacation and in fact am leaving in the morning.  I will have to get back to you when I return which will not be until the 22nd. 
 I was just cleaning out my e-mails (well, a few of them anyway) and ran across this.  I hope you already knew about it but if not maybe it's not too late to have input. 
 I got another one. 
 Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.  I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.  Is it yours? 
 My apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for David Portz.  He was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my supervision and I didn't see his suggested reviewer list until today.

 Stacey,  Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions:  1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.) 2.  German Energy Markets 3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms  There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate:  Christophe's panel discussion on new markets E-commerce panel  I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda. 
 Yes, I think I did approve this by a reply e-mail earlier this week.    Holly Keiser@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/25/2001 08:48 AM 
 The single greatest improvement you could possibly make would be to allow the making of reservations for reward travel. 
 Thanks for this memo -- definitely comforting for the vast majority of our swap business.  I think the additional interesting question is whether or not we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?"  Would you like me to ask Emory to expand?    Julia Murray 05/24/2001 06:28 PM 
 approved 
 My mistake in raising the issue - Peter Sceats is with the broker in London who arranged the trade. 
 Is this one OK as well? 
 Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:  Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?"

 As per my call. 
 I've got three undeveloped rolls of film in my car that I keep meaning to get developed but always forget until I'm not in the car.  I'll get around to it one of these days.  My address is:  1322 Rutland St. Houston, TX  77008  (713)863-7190 
 Here is a draft of the US version.  Please let me know if it works for you. 
 Homer -  The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month.  As far as I know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us here?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month):  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction.  In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a commercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.  If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up with alternative language.  Mark    Homer Lin 06/01/2001 10:15 AM 
 Peter -  We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem.  Mark    Peter Keohane 05/31/2001 11:54 AM

 Can you help them with this? 
 I haven't heard anything from anyone but you and the EnronOnline team.  I suggest we go forward as you suggested in your June 4 e-mail and deal with the mid-month to mid-month issue if it ever actually arises.     Homer Lin 06/07/2001 07:11 AM 
 Let's discuss this. 
 As per our call. 
 Don't worry about the delay - if you want to wait til later next week that's fine by me. 
 In this case, I would view you as Andrea's supervisor and I would be her representative at the PRC which would be here in Houston.    Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/29/2000 06:27 AM 
 Looks good to me. 
 It turns out that quite a bit has been happening without us so we may be inundated with information over the next day or so.  Let me know if the message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to decipher.  Louise is quite anxious to finalize the ETA, PA and Read-only PA and I explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from London. Knowing Louise I have a feeling we may see that stuff soon.  Since we seem to be a bit behind schedule, Louise agreed that an all-hands legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the London team to discuss scheduling.  I'll let you know as soon as I have anything more to report on the calendar.  Mark 
 From the NYT article:  The business that Thomas D. Gros is building for Enron remains untested. But his entire career seems to have been aimed at the opportunity.  He studied aerospace engineering, worked as an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, earned an M.B.A. and set up a natural-gas trading operation -- competing against Enron -- for British Petroleum. He also did a stint on Wall Street with Chemical Bank. 
 Paul:  Since the recent pet coke swap (deal 8025) is really a US deal, we should probably do the documentation here.  Would you please send me a copy of the confirm for the coal swap you worked on for us to use as a starting point?  Thanks,  Mark 
 Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.  They were sent to Sullivan & Cromwell yesterday to be "Americanized" and are still drafts with a number of open issues yet to be resolved - so we can easily make changes as necessary to solve issues you may raise.  The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us before a password is issued. The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before trading is permitted. The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade). 
 This is the e-mail I mentioned yesterday.  It is not exactly what had been described to me and I do have concerns with it.  My preference would be to limit the clause to the providing of letters of credit whenever we ask (as opposed to any security in form and from a provider satisfactory to us).  I understand that London legal was doing some tinkering with the language but I haven't seen anything from them yet.  Let's discuss. 
 I will be handling the derivatives side of the ETOL transaction this time so future communications should probably come to me directly.  I will be reviewing the ISDA draft this weekend and it would be helpful if I could get some sort of description of the overall transaction.  Is there a term sheet or executive summary of the deal?  If so, my fax # is (713)646-3490. 
 Thanks for your note.  Yes, I am available for the call and have asked Sullivan & Cromwell to have someone available as well.  As soon as the time is firm, I will be able to let you know who at S&C to call. 
 Unfortunately, I already have a meeting from 11 to 1 Houston time.  I'm free from 9:45 to 11 and then after 1. 
 Marc:  I want to go but T doesn't (the photo of the cast not up to T's high standards) so I'm afraid we won't be joining you.  Thanks for the invite - maybe dinner or drinks after or Sat.? 
 That sounds like fun - what did you do last month? 
 Any preference? 
 This looks a lot better to me.  What do you guys think? 
 Sorry - I got the address wrong yesterday. 
 Are you the right person to handle these details?  If not, please try to find out who it is and then let me know so I can communicate with Martin. 
 I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the "green book" and my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against us, we are cushioned by our "out-of-the-moneyness" and will be able to ask for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language (taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far we go out of the money:  "Credit Support Amount" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as provided in the definition of that term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts.  I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of alternatives for Paragraph 13.

 One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to Heaven. There he meets the Lord himself. The Lord says to the cat, "You lived a good life and if there is anyway I can make your stay in Heaven more comfortable, please let Me know."  The cat thinks for a moment and says, "Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor."  The Lord stops the cat and says, "Say no more," and a wonderful fluffy pillow  appears.  A few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to Heaven. Again the Lord is there to greet them with the same offer.  The mice answer, "All of our lives we have been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms.  Running, running, running;  we're tired of running. Do you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?"  The Lord says, "Say no more," and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller skates.  About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep sleep on the pillow. The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing. The cat replies better than I could have ever expected. And those Meals on Wheels you've been sending by are theeeeeeee best!!!"

 Here is the draft form for the US derivatives GTC. 
 I think this is the most recent version of the ETA.  Obviously, this is the UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.  The US version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.  We're also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be different from the UK version.  Speaking of which, I was surprised to find that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties. What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time (2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?  Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.  I'll be calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made to the ETA if necessary. 
 Martin:  I am told by my assistant (Jan Dobernecker) that the Human Resources Department here has people who will assist you on the practicalities.  Jan has asked them to get in touch with you directly.  If you have not heard from someone by the middle of next week, please let me or Jan know so we can either prod them into action or get you a contact name and number to call.  We are all very much looking forward to your arrival and I'd be happy to discuss any questions (and I'm sure there must be several) that come to mind - just give me a call.  Mark

 Have you heard anything about this? I can't get into this on the internet from here but will certainly check into it when I get back. 
 I particularly like the grand prize winner.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 sorry - sent that last one by mistake 
 Here are the most recent versions of the US documents. 
 Here is a revised version of my draft GTC's for derivatives transactions (I think marked from the draft I left with you).  Any comments or suggestions? I've promised these to Louise by Friday.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Thanks Harry - yours are the first North American GTC's in! 
 Louise Kitchen will be in my office (EB3889) this afternoon at around 3:00 to answer any last minute questions you may have in preparing your online GTC's.  Mark 
 Jan:  I meant to cc you on this but forgot - here is my response to Martin. 
 Are we inviting London? 
 My apologies for any confusion resulting from my e-mail yesterday.  While the GTC's must be finished this morning, Legal's revisions to the short and long descriptions are not due until Friday August 6.  I think it would make sense for us all to get together to discuss how these work early next week.  I will ask Taffy to set something up.  Mark 
 Here are my revised versions - I look forward to your comments. 
 Here are the contract forms which I delivered in hardcopy this afternoon. 
 Louise,  I hope you had a pleasant weekend in N.O.  If you have a few minutes to spare, I'd like to get together with you this afternoon  to talk about the weather deal documentation.  As I tried to draft up the standard GTC's I realized there are more variables in these transactions than are currently listed in the short & long description lists.  Mark 
 I will be there. 
 FYI 
 Can you handle this? 
 'Twas The Night Before Christmas as written by a lawyer  'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the second part).  The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.  Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.  As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.  His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.  Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:  "Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn." 
 FYI 
 Here is the spreadsheet which lists all of the existing counterparties proposed to receive access to the online trading system.  Louise has asked us to identify for each counterparty those products from which, for legal reasons, such counterparty should be restricted.  As you might expect, our goal is to have as few restrictions as possible.  Since it is so wide, you may find that it is easier to modify the spreadsheet (by hiding various columns) in order to print it out.  If you need any help in this regard, please let me know. 
 I understand that you may be in the Houston office at some point this week. If so, I would like to get a few minutes on your schedule to talk about South American Legal staffing issues.  Could you give me a call (713-853-7459) or drop me an e-mail with what might work for you?  If you are not actually in the office but have some time to talk on the phone, that would work too.  Thanks,  Mark 
 As yourequested. 
 Digital Frontiers Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid By ROSS SNEL  08/03/1999 American Banker Page 12 Copyright (c) 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not all, of their business in cyberspace.  The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage contracts that are digitally signed.  Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most require customers to enroll and order account transfers by sending in paper documents. The law makes such paperwork no longer necessary.  Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds customer identities to documents-are seen as a way to "legalize" on-line exchanges of information.  The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into law last week, "gives people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable," said Thomas J. Smedinghoff, a partner in the Chicago law firm McBride Baker & Coles and a leading authority on digital signatures.  He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature could limit the flexibility of its application as the technology evolves.  Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important to securities brokers, because securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise transactions on the Internet, said Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass.  E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the California bill, bringing the issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose. Sen. Vasconcellos introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15.  San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage, also offered input on the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos' chief of staff, Rand Martin.  Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level, however, a spokesman for the company said. "This action is a step in the right direction," the spokesman said. "But the real objective would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the use of digital signatures."  E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its transactions with customers in all 50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California is "murky."  E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law applying across the country.  Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic commerce division, said the only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated that a contract was governed by the laws of California.  Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state. For example, Connecticut law covers only medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures applicable to all communications.  In 1995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature legislation, but that legislation was limited to communication with government agencies.  Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a comprehensive law that preceded California's in 1995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of Digital Signature Trust Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority.  To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) this year introduced two bills addressing the issue. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to clarify the legal status of electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities Transaction Act focuses on the securities industry.   http://www.americanbanker.com Contact: http://www.americanbanker.com

 I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.  I'll bring along some sailing info. but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind.  Dan & Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of us.  We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving.  We'd fly down there on Saturday the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th or Sunday the 28th.  [The return date is still under discussion - so far we have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as possible so wants to come back Sun., and (iii) Ted who when he heard the question said "Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South Beach!"]  The charter company is the Moorings (their website is www.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings 463.  You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom.  Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to remember Jamie getting up pretty early & making coffee), have breakfast on the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe not.  Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day.  Most days we only actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:00 and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks, etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or whatever (my favorite).  There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal proclivity for the duration of the trip.  If you scuba dive there are dive companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI.  If you want to learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan & Jamie might be diving, Ted & I probably won't).  Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail hour for me.  There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the boat with food (there's a fridge, stove & bbq grill on the boat) and as you might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board if we don' feel like going ashore.  While no one is excluded from any activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't always do everything together, either.  Everybody usually pitches in and shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't be expected to cook.  In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck.  As for $,  the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night we get there all comes to about $760 per person.  Extras include drinks (only fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare.  I've tentatively got flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $544 per person, though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down.  Ted & I usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're not always successful.  It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved until we do.  I'd better stop & send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing! Check out the website & let me know if you have any questions. 
 Sorry about all these - it looks like people who don't know my address are just guessing and they get you instead.  I'd appreciate it if you could forward them on to me when they come to you - I'll let the sendersknow the correct address as I get them and hopefully that should cut down the number going forward.  Mark 
 Let's add this as an agenda item to discuss when Sara and I are there. 
 We're thinking about flying down to some nice sunny spot and renting ("chartering" is the technical term) a boat for a week.  We've done this quite a few times in previous years: British Virgin Islands, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Grenada, etc. 
 I'll be there!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Just to give you an idea of the kinds of things Brent and Andrea are working on. 
 Please do a card for my rolodex.  Thanks 
 Marcus:  When we were in New Orleans I mentioned that I might be planning a holiday in Germany - well, I've finally gotten around to scheduling it.  I'm flying into Munich on the 27th and leaving from Amsterdam September 9.  If you are going to be in the office next Monday or Tuesday (when I'll be in the London office), I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever suggestions you would like to make.  If you will be out next week, maybe we could chat by phone tomorrow or Friday.  Thanks!  Mark 
 I spoke with Bill about this and he agreed it was a good idea. 
 In order to complete the approved list of counterparties fo the new online trading system I need a list of master agreements you have negotiated that do not have all the necessary representations (e.g. trade option exemption) and definition references to permit trading energy commodity derivatives.  Friday noon would be soon enough.  Thanks,  Mark 
 This might be good for you to go to. 
 Looks good to me.  Enjoy! 
 Please print this out for me. 
 Laurel:  Apologies for my delay in responding to you.  Carol St. Clair is helping me with this transaction now.  She will get back to you on the confirms.  Please copy her on future e-mails.  Mark 
 If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, it's just possible you haven't fully grasped the situation. 
 I'm off to London tomorrow (after a stopover day in NYC and back next Wed.) but T will be around all weekend.  Are you guys here or traveling again? 
 I will not be available for the call on Friday. 
 I like to leave for London at least a day earlier than absolutely necessary so I have a day to get adjusted to the time change - otherwise you get off the plane and go straight to the office (with a shower on the way if you're lucky) and I'm exhausted at that point.  I don't ever sleep well on the plane.  This time I'm leaving on Friday afternoon to stop in NY for a party Friday night and then leaving for London from there on Sat. night.  Since the company pays for business class, there's no savings for going over the weekend.  I could get a free companion ticket for T but he's never been able to get off work at the same time I have to go.  The rest of our August is a bit hectic, too.  Next weekend T has a swim meet in San Francisco and I leave that Mon. night to spend the rest of the week in S. America. The following weekend we had tentatively set a trip to Laguna Beach but I think it's been canceled for lack of funds if not just so I can catch my breath.  We leave on our big trip to Europe (Germany, Belgium & the Netherlands) on the 26th and don't get home til 9/12.  I have to pack tonight so I think we'll pass on the film.  I hope we get a chance to get together some time in the next few weeks - maybe a weeknight dinner some time since the weekends look pretty full? 
 It strikes me that it would be appropriate to offer this service without the application fee and deposit to Platinum Elite members and Presidents Club members.  If not, the fact that ANY spaces are being removed from the already inadequate supply will only infuriate me, not make me happy.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Thanks for the update - I can't say I'm too sorry about any delay since I haven't had a spare moment to look at them yet anyway.  This project moves so fast and there's so much to do it's scary! 
 Hey Marc - what time is your soiree tomorrow? 
 Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not contain the necessary elements for trding energy commodity derivatives?  In particular I'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.

 Hey Yao!  How are you doing these days?  We never see you anymore.  I'm going over to London on Saturday - any chance you'll be in that part of the world?  On a business note, we are getting set up to trade energy commodities and derivatives online and one of the things we have to do is figure out what we can trade with each potential counterparty.  Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not contain the necessary elements for trading energy commodity derivatives?  In particular I'm thinking about things like the trade option exemption representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.  Thanks!  Mark 
 Thanks Marcus - I'll give you a call when I'm in London next week. 
 Unfortunately, you have the wrong e-mail address for me.  My correct address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com. 
 It's not clear to me which form you want - we have (i) an "Annex A" which we use like a general terms and conditions to attach to a one-off confirm (i.e. where there is no master agreement in place) and is sometimes called the "Omnibus" (because it's a single form for any type of commodity derivative which replaced a multitude of separate forms) or (ii) a "Schedule" which is attached to the ISDA form agreement to make it our version of the ISDA master which can then have a collateral support annex attached.  Just to make it a little more complicated, we also have our own form of master agreement which we use with less sophisticated counterparties and where we need to translate the document into another language (which we don't want to do with the ISDA). Just let me know which one you want & I'll have Tana e-mail it to you.  This stuff is all covered in Tana's short-course on ECT derivatives documentation - maybe you'd like to sit in on it when she comes over? 
 I'm headed to South America next week.  Any particular issues you think I need to be aware of or anything you want me to look into? 
 Cindy - I won't be able to make the 8/17 meeting.  I will be at the 8/25 meeting.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Here is the North American legal issues list I prepared for Mark.  He actually called me down to ask for it yesterday (my first day back no less). Obviously I've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual legal risk.  He seemed satisfied enough with the format.  I explained that I had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a European version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many jurisdictions to deal with. 
 The Online Trading IT people have sent us a revised version of the long descriptions and a document spelling out the "rules" for how they are put together.  Louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on next Wednesday (August 18th).  Since I will be out of town then, please forward your comments and/or approvals directly to Mark Dilworth.  Questions can be directed to Mark Dilworth, Marcello Romano or Louise Kitchen, all on the online trading team. 
 Please note that my correct e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com. 
 I understand that there may be a few additional changes but these are the revisions from our meeting on Monday. 
 Mark H. has asked me to let him know exactly what we will be sending out on 9/13.  Would it be accurate to say it will be no more than a flashy brochure with the recently circulated content together with a blank password application all in a very exciting package of some kind? 
 Joao -  I'm making another business trip to Brazil - this time just to Sao Paolo. I'll be there Tuesday to Thursday of this week.  Any chance you will be nearby?  I tried to arrange a meeting in Rio too but unfortunately our office there is quite small and the only people I need to see will be in Sao Paolo then.  I also still get to London every once in a while.  Let me know when you are there - maybe we can have dinner.  Mark 
 Here are my draftversions of the weather GTC's.  Since Enron North America will be the Enron contracting entity for all of the transactions, I have expanded the documents to allow for European as well as U.S. transactions and to allow for multiple weather station (index) deals or single weather station deals.  The option forms work for either a put or call but that has to be specified on the web site.  I think it would make sense for one of the weather commercial people to take a quick look at the forms to make sure they agree that they work.  I'm hoping to sit down with Mark Dilworth in the morning to make sure the long descriptions are complete - when you look at these forms, it is clear that a number of defined terms have to be covered on the web site: Premium, Effective Date, Termination Date, Reference Weather Station(s), Fallback Reference Weather Station(s), Reference Basis, Reference Degrees (C or F), Strike Amount, Notional Amount and Maximum Payout Limit are the terms I have identified so far.  Please Note - these are NOT ready to be uploaded to the system!  There are blanks for the weather agencies for the European deals - these are not referenced in the earlier UK drafts and I don't know who the appropriate agencies are.  I have not spelled out the data sources for the European transactions either.  Mark 
 Please e-mail these forms to Scott. 
 Mark -  Would you be available to sit down with me Monday morning (say beginning at 10:30) to go over the spreadsheet?  I have quite a few comments on the financial transaction items that I was able to understand and several questions on areas I haven't yet been able to decipher.  I am particularly concerned about the Weather Products generally and the Floating Prices for all financial products (the Index tab).  If you could let me or my assistant know so I can work out my calendar for the day I'd appreciate it (I've blocked out 2 hours but it might not take that long).  Unfortunately I'm leaving town mid-afternoon so I have to get these wrapped up.  I'm at x37459.  Thanks!  Mark  p.s. - It might make sense to have somebody from the Confirmation Desk come too - what do you think? 
 Here is the spreadsheet with my comments to date. 
 The letter looks fine to me  (one typo on the last page where the "O" in EnronOnline is not capitalized). 
 I have suggested that Mark Dilworth, one of the guys responsible for the web site development, schedule some time with each of you to discuss the latest Long Descriptions spreadsheet.  He can walk you through exactly how it works for your commodities so you can make informed comments. 
 The addition of Paris is news to me so we may have to make a few extra modifications I had not anticipated.  Once you get the info why don't you take a crack at making the necessary changes & let me know.  It may be pretty obvious but I think I can walk you through it on the phone if it's not. 
 Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre. __________________________________________________________ Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird  (A true story from Associated Press, by Kurt Westervelt)  Stick with this.....it's worth it!  This is the strangest thing I've ever heard.  The series of events that had to have taken place in order for this to happen are astounding!  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death:  On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head.  Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide.  He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency.  As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed him instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he planned.  "Ordinarily," Dr. Mills continued, "A person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as committing suicide.  That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.  The room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife.  They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun.  The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus as he passed by outside.  When someone, intending to kill person "A," kills person "B" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.  When confronted with a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded.  The old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He had no intention to murder her.  Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.  The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.  It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.  Now comes the final twist!  Further investigation revealed that the couple's son was in fact, Ronald Opus.  He had become increasingly despondent over his failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun blast passing through the ninth floor window.  The son had actually murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a suicide. 
 I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.  When a traveller is placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.  If you wait for the provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the person on the phone before anyone on the list.  Other agents have done this for me, I have done this for myself, and it works. 
 Tana - please send a copy of the Stikeman memo to Peter Keohane.  Thanks!  Mark 
 Sorry Paige - I was in South America last week - will respond today. 
 Sorry for not getting back to you sooner (I was out of town last weeek) - unfortunately, I have a 2:00 already on my calendar but am available later. If you want to meet with Alan & Jeff first and see me afterwards, that's ok with me. 
 Any idea what database he's talking about? 
 Any objection to having David Gilberg fill in for me on this? 
 I'll be on vacation then - see you in September! 
 I see what you mean, and I can't explain the bcc - unfortunately, unless they use "mtaylo1@ect.enron.com" it doesn't get here.  It must just disappear into cyberspace.  Thanks for continuing to send them on.  Mark 
 Please note that my e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.  If you use mtaylor it goes to someone else and may or may not get forwarded to me later. 
 Paige - I can be more argumentative here but if it's not going to make any difference in the outcome, I don't really see the point.  Let me know if you disagree.  While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment which may be payable to the defaulting party.  An event of default and resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, etc.). 
 Mark - It looks like the new version (that I received from Andrew last week) does not contain the comments I had already made.  Have those been lost somewhere? 
 Marie - would you please check with Credit and see if you can help with this issue.  Thanks,  Mark 
 The October days are fine with me.  I will be out that week in November so I'd appreciate it if you could coordinate with Sara and Shari to make sure we'll have adequate coverage. 
 I've been through both documents and can not find my comments.  I wonder if there is a later draft somewhere? 
 Yes but gtc's not confirmed as complete set and long descriptions not yet reviewed. 
 Mike -  In a word - no.  We'll add it in and you don't need to worry.  Mark 
 Could you please send Tana the list of countries from which online trading of derivatives with ECT is permissible.  She is trying to complete the Counterparty spreadsheet for Louise.  Thanks!  Mark 
 Looks good to me. 
 Do you want to set up a time to meet tomorrow?  How does 10 a.m. look for you? 
 I haven't received anything yet - and have a meeting I have to go to now. I'll check back in an hour or so. 
 Fiona -  Welcome to the Legal Dept.!  I think Taffy was coordinating with you regarding my dinner with Mark this week,  Unfortunately, my trip was canceled at the very last minute this afternoon.  Mark is already aware of the change but he may now have an open slot for dinner on Wed.  I'm sorry I won't be able to meet you this week but will look forward to it on my next trip over.  Mark 
 I'm in EB3889. 
 Hey Dave!  Thanks for your note.  Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back." And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.  We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.  The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.  Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.  Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon. Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the quality of work to date?  Talk to you soon.  Mark 
 Thanks for the itinerary.  Please note that my e-mail address begins with mtaylo1, not mtaylor (which goes to Mitch Taylor). 
 Please note that Mark Dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning (11:00 EB2601a) will not be of the entire EnronOnline system but will focus on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions.  The system now builds the entire long description from the various elements - most of which we have already reviewed - and displays them as they will be viewed by counterparties online.  It is particularly important that the lawyers responsible for the long descriptions and the GTC's attend so that we can complete the review process.  If you can not attend, please let me know so we can set up a time for Mark to show you how to access the system.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Dave:  One item that was left open after my meeting with Mark D. this morning was what the Index should look like and how much input we have had from the confirm desk.  My inclination was that the index should be the same language that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous contract.  Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal text could wait for the paper confirm.  Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal language.  Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make sense to give you my version as well.  What are your thoughts?  If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:00 tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 11.  Mark 
 It may be that you don't need to be there at all.  This relates to the online trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of the system.  If you haven't been involved yet, it probably means that somebody else (maybe Wayne, Harry or Janice?) is responsible for the commodities you handle.  The project is only confidential in that we're trying to minimize information outside of Enron about it.  There's no problem talking about it internally.  You're certainly welcome to attend if you want to find out more about it, but if somebody else in your group is already covering things, you don't need to worry about it.  Mark 
 Dave - could you please give me a call about this - I think it would be easier to explain over the phone.  I have an interview scheduled at 9:30 but am at your disposal after that.  Mark 
 Just a 'heads up' - there is now no doubt that there will need to be some major revisions to the index language.  I am meeting with some of the folks from the confirm desks this afternoon to get them started on a further review.  Can you please arrange to have the following people given access to the Product Manager:  Jeff Sorenson Dale Neuner Bob Bowen Lynn Shivers Kevin Sweeney 
 Hey guy - Ted's going swimming & can be there a little after after 8:30 - I'll be at the gym until 8.  Any chance that would fit into your schedule? 
 FYI 
 Here's my revised version - let me know what you think. 
 Frank - I think Harry Collins is tracking this down.  If it isn't settled to your satisfaction by Thursday, please let me know.  Mark 
 FYI 
 I'll be there. 
 Thanks for your note.  If you are still trying to decide about shore excursions, I was just remembering my trip and have the following observations:  I found the volcano on the Big Island to be marginally interesting, not particularly pretty, and from where I was staying (Kona), a very long day.  Kauai was very beautiful - the Na Pali coast is particularly spectacular (that coast and the nearby beaches are where South Pacific was filmed) but it is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as I remember it except on foot or by boat.  I would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is available, otherwise, you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a pretty good view.  There is also a river boat trip I didn't get to take so I can't recommend it - it was popular with visitors.  I didn't make it to Maui but I've always thought it would be fun to go to the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise (in a car or bus) and then ride down the hill on a bicycle.  There was a bay near Honolulu on Oahu (near Diamond Head) where I did my first-ever snorkeling.  It was very popular (crowded) but a lot of fun and while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead (not a lot of pretty coral).  I found the web site for the dolphin lab where I worked but a quick look didn't indicate they have a visitors center.  You might call them when you are there if you have the extra time and want to go. http://dolphin-institute.org/  As far as your clothes are concerned, since you won't have to carry them yourselves, why not  take them all!  Have a great trip!  Love, Mark 
 The language works for me as long as the long description describes multi-month options as a series of multiple options.

 I tried. 
 I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French counterparties are ok? 
 Looks ok to me. 
 Non-smoking please. 
 I've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference issues. 
 Give me a call with any questions.    Christian Yoder 
 If Debbie is talking about the language she and I discussed late last week, that is new credit language that has not yet gone in to any of the GTC's. 
 Alan:  Are you still the code of conduct person?  If not, let me know & I'll keep looking.  Mark 
 I found it! 
 My analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the contract will be enforceable.  It is certainly not necessary from my point of view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact I think that looks much better.  It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the "agree" button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement had been scrolled through.  I personally think that would create more problems from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on "agree" as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away.  David - do you agree? 
 Same treatment as for telephone trading.    Enron North America Corp. 
 The 15th looks fine.  The 23rd and 24th are already holidays.  As for the 22nd, please coordinate with the other legal assistants to make sure we will have coverage that week. 
 In this case I would say do whatever is easiest for you guys.  Since we know that Enron Canada is qualified, we don't really have to have the representation but if it is easier for you to not make an exception, it doesn't hurt to have it in. 
 FYI 
 Hey Marc -  I'm here - it's actually nice to be home & not traveling for a while.  Will you guys be around this weekend?  It doesn't look like I can help your friend.  We almost never hire lawyers fresh out of law school.  Believe it or not, they don't really teach you how to be a lawyer in law school so passing the bar is just the first step.  Your first job is where your real training takes place.  We just don't have the time and capacity to train junior lawyers so we try to hire people who have worked for a number of years (usually at least 5 or 6) at a good law firm. They get good training there and we don't have to hassle with it. 
 Tanya wants us to use this credit for the 5 deemed ISDA's for AIG that Lucy is working on. 
 Can you guys please send over a copy of the questions that were submitted to local counsel in Europe relating to the online trading project?  Alan needs it for Australia and Louise has asked me to deal with Columbia.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Martin:  Thanks for your note.  Is there an English language version of your presentation available?  Mark 
 I have marked my revisions below. 
 Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online system.  I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.  They do have the advantage of being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.  I don't think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest material.  The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.  The first time the counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an "I Agree" box after scrolling through the agreement.  The GTC's are the contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master agreement in place.  Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.  While most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our "Omnibus" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a "Deemed ISDA."  One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call for collateral if we choose. 
 Maybe you can just respond to this? 
 Here is my first cut at an Issues List for Wednesday.  Let me know what you think.  My meeting with Mark H. has been moved up to 1:00.  He may want to get you on the phone then but I don't really know. 
 My only concern is knowing which way the Inside FERC price adjustment that is submitted will go - will it always be plus or always minus?  If so, let's say so.  If not, how will it be clear on the web site which direction the adjustment is going? 
 Was there supposed to be an attachment to the e-mail or are these coming inter-office? 
 I would suggest changing "attain" to "obtain." 
 EPMI and RMT are two different corporations.  As I understand it, in North America EPMI enters into only physical power transactions with third parties while ENA enters into financial transactions.  RMT handles financial transactions between wholly-owned Enron companies.  If the transaction you are handling is a derivative between ENA and Australia, it should be documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and the other between RMT and Australia.  That's why the master agreement is between RMT and Australia.  I don't know how the booking is handled. 
 Given the absences, conflicts and heavy work-loads, let's cancel the meeting scheduled for this morning. 
 The same people may be involved but there are tax savings achieved by passing all the derivatives through RMT. 
 Fred called & asked if we could move our lunch from Monday to Thursday or Friday.  Does Thursday work for you? 
 Stephanie:  Sorry I didn't see your response until today.  The prior tenant is moving out today so the house will be available as soon as I can get it cleaned up and any necessary repairs made.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.  Mark 
 Something must have happened in the transmission process - I can't make anything out of the info below. 
 You can ignore that last e-mail. 
 We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.  A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process. 
 Looks good to me.  Are we certain that all of the other traders plan to post daily volumes?

 Looks good to me. 
 Good idea.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks for your help last week.  Saturday night was a lot of fun! 
 What is the proposed process once Legal receives this kind of request? 
 How does the New Product Type Approval process work?  We have received several test messages but it is not clear how we look beyond the short description in the e-mail to see the long description (can the short description be set up as a hyperlink to the web-site?) or how we are supposed to respond (my attempted reply was rejected as undeliverable). 
 I noticed that ISDA is putting on a one-day course in London October 19 on Documenting and Confirming Credit Derivative Transactions.  If you are interested and haven't received the brochure, let me know and I can fax it to you. 
 Sorry for the delay - my e-mail has been down all day. 
 We may have some problems with derivatives trading in Mexico - see Tana's note from earlier today.  I'll start the process for the ETA & PA. 
 FYI 
 I was glad to see that the next Monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time other than December.  I guess Monmouth is a little harder to get to than Chicago but it will be nice to see the campus again.  I'm going to be in New York Nov. 1 & 2.  Any chance of getting together?  Mark 
 The difficulty is in knowing which entites are regulated and which are not. For instance, ENA is an "unregulated" affiliate of a regulated utility (PGE).  But many utilities have energy services companies affiliates which, while not regulated utilities like San Diego Gas & Electric, are nevertheless heavily regulated.  We have tried to figure out what we can in the time available and have relied on readily available public inofrmation. 
 We are getting very excited about the BVI.  It's hard to believe it's only 5 weeks away.  I try to think about it whenever the stock market gets me depressed (which is happening with altogether too much frequency these days).  I see you guys got hit with a triple whammy today.  Oh well, can you say "buying opportunity"?  I'm coming to NYC for a conference in a couple of weeks - any chance you guys are free for dinner on Sunday the 31st?  We also need to talk about $ sometime soon since I made the final payment on the boat a couple of weeks ago.  Have you made your hotel arrangements (we still have a room reserved for you for the night of the 20th which you won't need if you've made other arrangements - and we can always get you a room there for the last night if you want)?   And there's still the beverage list (you did get my fax, didn't you?).  T. sends regards.  Hope you're well and not letting the market roller-coaster get you down (my mantra is "think long term, think long term, think long term").  Mark 
 Today's simulation has been postponed to next Wednesday.  Unfortunately, they have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the Enron intranet to get access.  If you want to see it badly enough, I might be able to arrange something for you in our NY office (midtown) otherwise I'll let you know when they roll it out onto the web.  Mark 
 As far as I know, this is the policy for all online trading.  Did I miss something? 
 Let's go for dinner Monday night.  With any luck I'll be able to get to the airport for a plane back to Houston Tues. night. 
 The people at Derivatives Week assure me that we should have access to their web site (www.derivativesweek.com) by Wednesday.  User ID: enalegal Password: swap 
 Here are my comments. 
 Yes, without doubt.  The ETA can't be amended on a counterparty by counterparty basis and it says that any applicable master agreement will control.  Leslie Hansen is also working on a draft.  If you get something from Justin, please forward a copy to me and Leslie.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Here it is! 
 Please arrange - hopefully for Tuesday since Wed. may be hectic. 
 I fully agree with the "fade" effect.  But this looks right to me.  As I remember it, we were not totally happy with the Notional Quantity language but this was the best we could do.  We were going to make sure that whether the submitted volume was per day or per month was clearly reflected elsewhere in the long description.  Not elegant, but adequate. 
 Thanks for your reply.  I think I'd prefer something that's not hosted if possible.  I can definately spend more for something that's either very nice or very interesting.  Also prefer to avoid far reaches of upper east or west sides. 
 Thanks for your note.  Of the three you have listed, #1643 is probably a bit far from public transport for me.  #1671 is convenient to the business I have on Mon. & Tues. (what is Double SS?).  #1966 sounds like a fun location.  I'd be willing to spend more for a place that is particularly well furnished or interesting (any loft spaces?). 
 Sounds reasonable to me.  I'm afraid the difficult questions are the one you posed to Peter and whether or not Credit will agree. 
 It's been long enough since I spent any time in the city that I don't really know what the good places are now.  Il Mulino and Union Square Cafe were always favorites.  What do you think?  Just something to keep in mind as you are evaluating your investments:  The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generation to the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount.  However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors to be taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be tried with dead horses, including the following:  1.   Buying a stronger whip. 2.   Changing riders. 3.   Threatening the horse with termination. 4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse. 5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses. 6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included. 7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse. 8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share. 9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired. 10.  Change the form so that it reads: "This horse is not dead." 11.  Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse. 12.  Harness several dead horses together for increased speed. 13.  Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting its full original cost. 14.  Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance. 15.  Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would improve productivity. 16.  Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster. 17.  Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs better. 18.  Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses. 19.  Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses. 20.  Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.

 Thanks for your note - hope you have time for a little fun while you're in SF - or at least some good food.  The Moorings said they should be able to put your part on the credit card if you want.  Their number is 800-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and it's under my name.  The guy I talked to said he'll have to call during regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.  Each person's share is currently $905.33.  That includes one night in the Moorings hotel so will go down by 55.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all. Beverages are covered by a separate payment.  I'll be glad to fax the invoice when you get a number for me.  If you want to send me your check, that's fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.  Regarding "connectedness,"  there were no internet cafes the last time I was there.  While that may have changed, there won't be more than one or two in the entire place, I'm sure.  Were you planning on bringing your laptop?  If so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won't have 110 volt current on the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.  It will be easy to check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.  But it's not cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min. to receive a call from the States and $2/min. to place one) and I'm reasonably comfortable that you won't be able to plug into it.  I'm not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not. We can find out from the Moorings.  I have an international cell phone I'm bringing along that also has infrared capability.  Does your laptop have one of those ir receivers?  If so, I can bring along the software you need to work it with this phone.  Not to be defeatist and I'm sure the times have changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to receive & send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon ran the machine out of paper.  When we asked for more paper it turns out we had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.  Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.  Let me just add in the spirit of self-preservation that it's a good idea.  It's not safe to ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.  Obviously feel free to bring as many of your own cd's as you want & if you let us know what types of tunes you like we'll try and bring ours (if any) that match.  Don't worry too much about Ted's taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman & headphones!  Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:  The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generation to the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount.

 This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade governed by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).  What do you think about Edmund's solution?  Mark 
 Would you be available to take Andrea Calo to dinner next Wednesday (the night before the Legal Conference)?  She is coming in a day early to meet & chat with people here. 
 Would you like me to set up some meetings for you with people here in the Houston office for the day before the Confernce?  If so, please let me know what your schedule is & I will ask my assistant to set up some times for you. 
 I had a voice mail from him Mon or Tues that said he would try and get into the office either today or tomorrow.  I expect he may be tied up with getting his son into the hospital and catching up with his wife so we may not see him til Monday. 
 I feel confident putting myself in your hands.  As long is it's not stratospheric, I should be able to get Enron to pick up the tab.  Please go ahead and book whatever you think would be good.  Just let me know when & where to go! 
 There is no organized transport to the Woodlands but it will be easy to make arrangements for you to ride with someone else leaving from the office - so I guess it makes sense for you to come in Thursday morning as well.  I'll try and set up a few meetings for you starting with lunch on Wednesday.  I was thinking primarily of lawyers here - anyone in particular you would like on the list? 
 Jeff, Alan & I will all be in a meeting at 10. 
 Would you please try and arrange for 30 min. meetings for Andrea Calo with as many of the following people as possible either Wednesday afternoon (from 2:00 to 6:00) or Thursday morning (from 9:00 to 10:30):  Mark Haedicke Jeff Hodge Dan Hyvl Michelle Blaine Rob Walls Scott Neal Pat Cini Elizabeth Sager Stacy Dickson Clement Abrams 
 I was planning to take her to lunch that day - you should feel free to take whoever you want. 
 As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force covering a particular transaction, the master controls.  I don't think we ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.  For example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices. However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that way.  They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless of what master agreements are in place.  To resolve this I suggest that the long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the ETA be revised as follows:  revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product "...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of the execution of such Transaction..."  (underlined text inserted)  I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the legal side? 
 I'm afraid I may never have called you back on this one - do we still need to discuss? 
 This probably needs to go on the utility form.  Assuming Watershed is gone, will you have time to start on this tomorrow? 
 My apologies but I'm afraid this one slipped through the cracks in my e-mail and I never responded - has this issue been addressed? 
 Did you ever hear back from the power people? 
 Please deliver my copies to the office.    Enron Capital Management 
 Here is Sullivan & Cromwell's reply. 
 Looks good to me.  Taffy: Please put these on the calendar. 
 Transacting  Question 4 - last line "accepted or rejected immediately upon receipt by the EnronOnline system" or "accepted or rejected by the EnronOnline system immediately upon receipt." Question 5 - similar comment - build in concept of processing immediately upon receipt by the system. Question 9 - Can the Master User give others Master User privileges or can traders within a company view each other's transactions if the Master User authorizes it?  If so, deleat Back Office User and substitute "and others authorized by your Master User".  If not, is it possible there will be more than one Back Office User?  I so, insert (s).  Products  Question 6 - last line "at the best price available on the EnronOnline system (if it is within the range you specify)"  Registration  Question 13 - still needs an answer.  Should it also apply to trader user ID's & passwords?  Legal   Question 3 - Password Application,not Agreement;  "framework for transactions carried out"  Earnings Related Questions - Will these be posted for all to see?  If so, we should have a Corp. lawyer look these over (SEC concerns).  These seem more appropriate as answers for PR and IR to have ready in case anyone asks.  You will no doubt recognize that I have exercised the utmost restraint - contrary to my every lawerly instinct - in commenting only on provisions that were identified as current changes. 
 What was this one about? 
 Plese print these out for the CFTC file. 
 I'm most concerned about the internet aspect of things now - this is new advice we are requesting and I would not expect it to be the lion's share of the expense - presumably the update portion will be relatively easy.    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI 
 Thanks for taking care of that.  I'm glad the Moorings was able to accomodate us.  Will you guys be free to get together Sunday eve.? 
 Was your "Yes" an answer to my question or Bruce's?  I hope it was mine - any particular preferences/schedule issues?  I can bring some sailing stuff for you - cruising guide to the Virgin Islands and a couple of sailing videos if you want. 
 Bummer - thanks for letting me know. 
 Master Agreements will cover trades with that entity only.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Don't forget the first session of the Conference begins at 1:00 tomorrow afternoon.  Attire for the entire event is casual but since the room may be cool and we hope to have dinner outside, you may want a sweater or jacket. 
 These master agreements will work for any North American financial product. 
 Thanks for spelling it out for me.  I WILL be in NYC this weekend and, while I have done it before and found it to be all you describe, would enjoy going to the parade with you.  As I remember it, the trick to limiting the aggravating and full of people factor is deciding where to watch and when to be there.   The embarrassment factor is significantly reduced by refusing to participate in the actual parade oneself and not knowing any participants (or at least not acknowledging them as they pass).  Do you have the time and route?  Maybe we can grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby.  As far as getting in the mood goes, try http://www.bviwelcome.com/ (I should know how to make that a link but I don't).  I'll definitely bring the cruising guide and a map if I can find it.  None of the videos I have is right on point (either the wrong size boat is involved or they're too advanced) but I'll bring them along anyway.  I have mixed feelings about bringing  Heavy Weather Sailing - I don't want to unnecessarily alarm anyone but we do want G to go to the doctor for the Transderm Scop patch!

 There appears to be a brand new book out by David Brin (one of Tim's authors) called "Heaven's Reach" which I think is still only available in hardback. If you decide not to get it, please let me know and I may.

 Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner - was out on Thurs & Fri.  I'm here and at the Waldorf 355-3000 room 1151.  Still have time for that quick drink? 
 Agreed. 
 I'll be out 11/22, 23 & 24 
 I'm afraid I'm still the right guy.  My comments below in red. 
 Lucy:  Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties. There are a couple of general rules that apply to "normal" trading circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances vary (even just a little bit) from "normal."  For example, abnormal situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:  1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or can't be done by us from the U.S.).  2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other rules may apply.  3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is actually "arranged" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.  These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) to get the risk in the right place. 
 Looks good to me. 
 Thanks for the joke - it's getting lots of laughs! 
 Tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the office for the next week or so.  We are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or operations.  You might want to check with Kate Cole's office to see what she knows. 
 Here are my comments - mostly minor. 
 I don't have anything handy - I suggest you contact Paige Grumulaitis. 
 I sent Dave comments on his last three additions yesterday and on the full version e-mailed to me (10/29) this afternoon.  Is the version I looked at the final one or were there subsequent changes to review? 
 keeping my fingers crossed..... 
 "bunnies"?  BUNNIES? 
 Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?  I know it's possible to fly into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick you up.  It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.  The timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John before the afternoon of the 22nd.  If you're nervous about sailing into the BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.  You might check the cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to go/anchor, etc. 
 Looks like this one is for me to review.  They will be sending these to all of us so that whenever one of us is out, we can let the others know to forward these on to whomever is appropriate.  We're supposed to get back to them within 24 hours. 
 There appear to have been some changes that were not made in the Canadian Long Descriptions.  Dave Forster will be forwarding them to you.  Please resend the language once those changes are incorporated.  Thanks!  Mark 
 Bummer - I had no idea the USVI wasn't considered part of the US - I'm assuming when you say "on the way back in" you mean from the USVI to the mainland since we could try to arrange things to avoid going back to the BVI while you were with us if that made a difference.  I don't have any leads on a possible stand-in, but don't really want one either since we've our hearts set on YOU.    Hopefully the lawyer can figure out a way to speed things up.  As a last resort, maybe we should check with Greg for a replacement since that's who he'll have to bunk with.  You have to be reasonably careful about such choices since you will be spending your holiday in pretty close contact with them.   It may also be a bit late to find transport to that part of the world; any hope of transferring the ticket in your name to someone else? 
 I have 4 tickets to the Thursday, November 18 Rockets vs. Sacramento Kings game (7:30 start).  Section 125, Row G. 
 Susan:  This is not urgent, but when you have a minute, please check and see what research we have done with local counsel in the Czech Republic.  I'm wondering in particular if they were part of our survey regarding European derivatives law. 
 Donna:  My comments are included below.  These are just suggestions and you can take them or leave them as you will.  Mark 
 Do you have time to compare this opinion to our current form?  Justin tells me he started from a form that was a year or more old. 
 I will give you a call to discuss.  Mark 
 Francisco & Lou:  Here is the reply from Figueroa Sierra.  Sorry for the delay in forwarding this on to you.  Mark 
 Agricultural product options are not permitted. 
 I think S&C is fine - they are helping us with CFTC issues related to online trading and Energy Desk.com seems somwhat related. 
 Here's the current forecast for Lenny.  Shouldn't be  a major problem for us but I feel for folks scheduled to go down there tomorrow and Thursday.  Bruce - we're still keeping our fingers crossed that your permit will come through.  Are you sure you've got the right lawyer working on this?  Seems like he ought to be able to shake it loose somehow.  Anything at all we can do from here? 
 The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel also.  They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday. They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have to bring the boat back).  I'll let you know what happens when I get through to them tomorrow.  Mark 
 David - We'r trying to get through to you on the phone but can't get across the Atlantic.  Can you try calling us?  I'm at 713 - 853-7459 & Jeff is at 713-853-6911.  Thanks 
 Just for your background info, the other reason we use deemed ISDAs on the interest rate & currency deals is that the omnibus was really drafted with commodity deals in mind.  I'd have to go back and look at it to see if it would work at all for an interest rate or currency deal.  Do you think I should do that?  Hopefully not or at least not til after 1/1.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 David - as to your point 2, we have used the "Deemed ISDA" appraoch for weather derivatives.  I see no reason we can't do something similar in Australia for power.  I've atached an example (but I'm not sure it is thefinal version).  Mark 
 Andrea Calo and Cecilia are not in the system to allow me to add them to your review.  Can you ask them to fill out the form and send it on to me (e-mail is fine).  The others were in the system and they should be able to fill everything out on their computers. 
 Please see the following note from Sheila Walton.  She has asked that the forms be returned to her by November 25th.  They can be sent interoffice mail or by e-mail.  Thanks,  Mark 
 It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or Puerto Rico.  We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be an exploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.  We can't get the boat to the USVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).  Best bet is to pick Bruce up in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a large, busy commercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the cruise ships (not fun).  There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas to St. John.  We won't be there before noon on Monday.  I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right thing here! 
 Bruce - I just had another thought (they come so rarely I feel a need to pass them along as soon as it happens).  The Full Moon party we discussed before is on Nov. 23.  Unfortunately it is in the BVI.  If your lawyer can get the permit by Monday and Fed Ex it to us, we could still get over there (Bomba's Shack is on the western end of Tortola - reasonably close to the USVI).  The boat will have a cell phone but we won't have a number till Sunday at the earliest.  Be sure to bring the lawyer's number so we can call him Monday.  Mark  P.S.  -  My sympathies on your day at Federal Plaza.  My imagination isn't up to the task of conjuring how miserable that must have been. 
 Yes - and boats.  I wasn't too worried until the last update which indicates the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there - just barely east of due south of the BVI.  They are predicting that it will resume its course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.  As of the middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the Friday charter starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's! 
 You have to be careful reading those reports - the 145mph number is the current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the south-east of St. Thomas.  The Weather channel this morning showed local radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was pretty far away.  The real question is what direction will it go from here. If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.  If it takes a turn to the north, direct hit.  I hadn't hard about the state of emergency but that could be due to rain related damage.  Many storm sites available: http://www.atwc.org/ http://www.gopbi.com/weather/storm/ http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1126/current.html http://weather.yahoo.com/graphics/tropical/tropical_html/atlantic/forecast_adv isory.html http://www.usatoday.com/weather/huricane/1999/atlantic/wstorm1.htm http://www.weather.com/weather_center/  In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at roughly 18 25' N 64 40' W St. Thomas is closer to 18 20' N 65 W 
 Interesting damage reports - particularly from St. Croix.  I had been looking at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be able to poke around in the USVI.  I seem to remember that the Moorings won't let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might want to get special permission.  Now I'm not so sure if the place will still be all ahoo when we get there.  It might not have been the entire group's cup of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way to and from St. John.  My impression is that I might be the only soul on board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a bit rough from storm effects.  I'm watching the national Weather Service updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.  Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for deliveries there.  You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas airport (next day service by 2 pm).  I mentioned in a previous note that the main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).  Fed Ex - (800) 247-4747  Mark 
 Good News:  Lenny weakening - max. winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising Bad News:  The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the north & east  It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all so small they almost don't show up on the maps.  Luckily St. Thomas is to the west and a bit north of Lenny's current position  Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th recent forecasted path maps. 
 Should I have received a copy already?  I don't remember seeing it. 
 I just got this update (emphasis added) - these coordinates put the storm just a tad south and a good (but not comfortable) bit east of St. Thomas & Tortola.  If it stays on this track, things will only improve in the VI. 
 t-shirts & bathing suits (daytime) polo/surf shirts & shorts (evening wear) beach towel (you may want to wait & buy this down there) boat shoes or sneakers sunglasses (polarized are best) prescription medication sunscreen! books music CDs camera & film snorkel mask & fins (your own will be better than the ones that come with the boat - give us your shoe size if you're not bringing your own) a few zip-lock bags may come in handy for packing wet items waterproof wallet is good to take along some $ if you decide to swim from boat to shore instead of taking dinghy  The Moorings should be able to tell you how to get from the USVI to their base on Tortola.  It may be either a combination of ferry to West End (aka Soper's Hole) Tortola and then a cab to the base in Road Town or a ferry straight to Road Town.  I don't really know.  I'm also no help on how often they run or how long they take.  If you can be at the Moorings by 11 or 11:30 Sunday morning that would be perfect.  Do you have contact info for your hotel in St. Thomas? 
 I have one change to suggest - see attached.     Enron North America Corp. 
 I may have a few minor drafting comments but this otherwise looks pretty good to me.  What do you think? 
 Test message. 
 I may not understand the question, but Legal does not need to be informed of each ETA that is executed. 
 My only concern is that the letter may not adequately tie the master agreement referred to and the products affected in a situation where we have more than one master (covering different commodities or transaction types) with the same counterparty.  I can imagine a situation where Credit doesn't want us to use a physical master but the financial master is ok or vice versa.  I mentioned this to Bob and he will watch for situations where Credit is only "turning off" one master in a multiple master setting.  We should also be listing each master affected if Credit wants to turn them all off. 
 Is this something you know anything about? 
 As you know, I will be out of the office next week.  I will have the cell phone with me:  011 44 7881 512 535  but unfortunately no way to recharge the thing after Sunday morning and no guarantee that it works in the Virgin Islands.  I suggest that if you try that number and do not get an answer that you NOT leave a message there.  It will be much more likely to get to me if you leave it here at the office (x37459).  There will be a cell phone on the boat, however, and I will call my assistant in Houston (Taffy - x57373) Monday morning with the number. 
 Jan:  Please print the attachments for me.  Thanks,  Mark

 That time works fine for me.  I am in EB3889. 
 I suggest you insert "with respect to the Transactions" after the word "Counterparty" in the second line of paragraph 1.  Otherwise they look great to me.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
 From a financial trading perspective, the Credit Group is reviewing each potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an "Eligible Swap Participant" (as defined in federal regulations as over a certain size) from trading derivatives.  Generally speaking, they don't approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit perspective but that is up to them. 
 Thanks for taking care of this.  Sorry I was not reachable. 
 Test reply. 
 Works for me. 
 We have been working on a somewat revised version of the online "override" letter.  What do you think? 
 We have an executed master agreement with Engage Energy Canada L.P. which we received signed around the end of August 1999. 
 A couple more to print, please. 
 That's fine with me - we're taking that approach on the "override" letters that override existing master agreements. 
 I'm still concerned about the circularity of the letter indicating that the GTC will control but then the GTC says the master will control.... 
 Here are my comments.  Do you want to add anything about the reason for this?  I don't think it's necessary from a legal point of view but might soften the letter a bit. 
 This phone number doesn't work - do you have another? 
 These are ok with me if Agency.com has approved.  How will PR be handling #3? 
 This is during our meeting with Michael Guerriero.  Would you prefer that I cover the ISDA call?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hi Bruce!  Ted took his first steps back to solid foods on Monday night.  He was so sick when we left you on Saturday that we had to motor the whole way back to Tortola and put him ashore for Saturday night.  We made our flight on Sunday and he went to the Dr. on Monday.  They think it was probably food poisoning but I don't see why nobody else got it.  Greg's expenses should certainly be part of the common fund.  There were a few other common expenses we haven't settled up on yet - Ted had a few groceries and a dinner and I paid for the beverage order).  I'll get Ted's numbers when I get home tonight and do a tally which I can send tomorrow. Let me know if you think of anything else.  When I first get back I usually feel the room swaying when it is small and enclosed (like an interior conference room or the shower).  It's a sure sign you were acclimatised to the boat! 
 I'm not sure which e-mail address you are using so I figured I'd send to both.  Here is my itinerary for Christmas travel:  Friday 12/24    Continental 4126  Leaves Houston 7:55 am  Arrives Cincinnati 11:20 am Sunday 12/26  Continentat 4122  Leaves Cincinnati 5:45 pm  Arrives Houston 7:25 pm  These are Continental Express flights - I don't know if that makes a difference in terminals in Cincinnati or not - it does in Houston.  I got your message at home, my SSN is ********* 
 Here is the draft of the amendment letter.  Please let me know if it is acceptable and I will have it executed. 
 Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth exchange By Corey Grice Staff Writer, CNET News.com December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT  The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. The currency? Bandwidth.  A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today opened the doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its intention to sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May.  Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like oil, natural gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and given it a telecommunications spin, offering space on high-speed networks to communications carriers.  In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or service gaps in their networks would have had to enter long-term contracts with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth needs. The exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman for carriers to find short-term contracts or quick fixes as they complete network construction or try to manage heavier-than-expected network traffic.  For example, Global Crossing plans to sell capacity on a high-speed fiber optic link between New York and Los Angeles over the exchange.  Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market next May.  Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its own commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New York today.  RateXchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other telecommunications products could become a $8 billion market by 2002. 
 Here are my drafts of letters for ECT and Seagull regarding the transfer of Seagull's positions at E.D.&F. Man.   Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Here's my letter.  Any comments?

 Sorry we've been out of touch lately.  We were on vacation (sailing in the Virgin Islands) the week of Thanksgiving and were pretty busy getting ready for it the week or two before that.  There was a big swim meet in San Antonio last weekend that T wanted to see so we drove out for that (yawn).  I didn't even know you were leaving BA!  I knew you had been sort of looking around for a while but didn't realize you had made a decision.  What's the story?  We're planning to have people over (it's the egg nog time of year) on the 18th - I'm guessing 8 - 10 pm but we'll let you know the details. 
 Sorry for the delay on getting back to you - looks good to me.

 11:30 (10:30 Central) works for me. 
 Thursday afternoon and Wednesday both look pretty good for me so far. 
 Here is a draft letter to the Exchange requesting permission to effect the Seagull transfer. 
 I left a voice mail for Paul but have not heard back yet. 
 I have spoken with Martin and he is going to forward some proposed language to me.  I will need to draft a reply letter to try and solve their issue. 
 You assume correctly. 
 Your understanding is correct - the trades are binding on the legal entity holding the user id and password.  Any trades done which either the counterparty or we want to be with a different entity should be assigned pursuant to a written assignment agreement.  If the counterparty continues to misuse the system, maybe we should deny access to the types of products particular entities are not "supposed" to trade. 
 Excellent solution! 
 Lucy:  Cemex has previously signed a confidentiality agreement with us based on our form of agreement.  Their form is significantly more burdensome for us.  I would prefer that we send our form and let them know that it is substantially similar to one previously executed in connection with another matter.  Mark 
 Hi Marc!  Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat. night for "Holiday Cheer" which at our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.  We'd love to see you guys. It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go to, you could make this one the kick-off.  The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of champagne we're going to share at home that night.  I asked T if we should plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.  That, of course, will change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!" around 12/29 or 30.  How's BMC?  What are you doing for them?  Do you know Clayton Williams?  I think he still works there.  Give us a call so we can catch up.  Tell G we said hi & hope to see you Saturday! 
 Looks good to me. 
 Any chance of getting the confirms to say "Ashland Inc. through its Ashland Specialty Chemicals Comapny division"?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Can you take care of this for me? 
 Here is the Confidentiality Agreement we signed last year. 
 CSC is Computer Science Corp. Joel's number is x57723. 
 Some of these are not final. 
 I would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this problem.  What do you think of a side agreement among both KN entities and Enron which specifies that a user ID and password have been issued to both of KN's legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain products (e.g. all financial products) entered into under that user ID and password will be deemed executed by KN Trading (their financial trading entity) and all others will be deemed executed by KN Marketing (their physical entity)?  Do you see any problems here?  Issues re: joint & several liability under the ETA but not the Transactions?  Let me know if you need further clarification of the problem.  I haven't run this by Louise yet - she may raise system or commercial objections.  Mark 
 My comments are marked below in red. 
 Same "calendar day" comment on the Gas Daily index.  "Succeeding" should have two c's.  On the Nymex index, what are we taking the "unweighed average" of?  This isn't clear to me.  Should "la" towards the end be capitalized? 
 Can you please check on this?  I thought we had wire-transferred the money to Sullvian & Cromwell. 
 Looks good to me!

 As per Gary's request, here is the revised letter.  If you will send the executed copies to me, I will arrange to have them signed on behalf of Enron. 
 Good catch!  And I agree, we're done. 
 You can send it to :  Mark Taylor Enron North America - EB3889 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX 77002  Thanks! 
 Adele:  Here is a draft of a letter agreement amending the online Electronic Trading Agreement.  Please let me know if it is ok and I will have a copy executed and faxed over to you.  My apologies for the delay - I thought I had sent this to you last week but I can't find any record of it so I must not have done it.  Mark 
 Where do I go to see the products? 
 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I never did come up with a good solution last year to the "cat climbing the Christmas tree" problem except fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the tree they didn't shake off.  This year she seems content to just hide underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just gotten too big.  I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about double-sided tape?  I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the tree).  And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden and metal ornaments - nothing breakable. 
 Cindy:  We have the signed letters - where should we send them? 
 Here is an example of what such a letter might look like which may satisfy several of the concerns you raised in our call this afternoon. 
 Paul:  It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be covered by an ISDA with some creative confirm work on our part.  It's certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.  The financial power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the question fully reviewed.  I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as the power pool is restructured:  to the extent we have any influence over the resulting structure, it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard financial trading structure.  Just random thoughts.  Mark 
 Let me check with Mr. B.  I don't think we have any specific plans - probably last minute shopping/wrapping.  We're both leaving on Thurs. and returning on Sun. 
 I do have some issues with the proposed language and will be discussing the details with Dale tomorrow. 
 How do you want to handle these? 
 Until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading (e.g. Chinese walls, public vs. private reference credits, etc.) I would encourage caution in how far you go with specific names.  Once they are tainted, it may not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for some time.  When would you like to go to New York to meet with Sullivan & Cromwell?  Let me know and I will set something up.  Mark 
 This looks fine to me.  Is this the way our confirmations read for telephone trades?  If not, do we need to make this change there also?  Mark 
 Looks good to me - It should probably get one last look by Mike Corbally, too. 
 That's fine with me - I don't anticipate any problems at this point.  Don't worry about losing days, though.  We can always make under the table adjustments next month if necessary. 
 There are conflicts for the 2:00 time slot and so many year-end deals taking up everyone's time and attention that I think it makes sense to reschedule for a later date. 
 Mark H. has asked me to prepare an outline of an "acceptable" regulatory framework for OTC energy derivatives that we could use as a fallback position next year.  Here is a draft I've come up with.  Any suggestions? 
 Friday at 10 looks good to us. 
 Thanks for your Christmas letter.  It was good to see how Celena has grown!  I'll be back in NYC Jan. 6 & 7 - any hope for dinner or at least a drink on Thurs. eve.?  My flight is scheduled to get in around 6:45 pm.  Mark 
 Mark,  You might want to check with Paul on this.  How have we arranged our IPE trading?  Since we are talking about exchange-traded contracts here, not dealing with customers, it may be possible to use an entity other than EEFT.  Hope all is well.  Mark 
 Louise - If you are back in Houston I'd like to get together and discuss the credit derivatives project.  Otherwise, maybe we can chat by phone?  Mark 
 I see what you mean.  Another thing we need to consider is whether or not this is part of our market maker status for the exchange - do you know if Bob wants Steve's activities in London to be part of that? 
 I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem getting one for them. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 It's ok with me.  Please check with Tana and Susan as well. 
 I agree completely, have talked to the Mayors Office - Citizens' Assistance Office, the Traffic & Transportation Dept. (who gave me Ms. Dorsey's name) and have written to Ms. Dorsey.  I suggest you also complain to our City Council member and the other at-large members.  Since Dorsey is the Bikeway Coordinator, she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated bikeway but Council members want our votes:  GABRIEL VASQUEZ gvasquez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think he represents the Heights ANNISE D. PARKER aparker@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think Gordon has already written to her GORDON QUAN gquan@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us ORLANDO SANCHEZ osanchez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us CHRIS BELL cbell@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us CARROLL G. ROBINSON crobinso@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us  The last 5 are "at-large" members of the council.  I got all of these from the City web site so I can't be sure it's a current list.  Another argument for two lanes on Heights is that with only one lane, some percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less safe for residents there.  And p.s. the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere - there's no connecting route at either end that I am aware of - do they expect all these hypothetical bicycle commuters to get on I 10? 
 I have now heard back from Ken Raisler's office that the only time he has left next week is Thursday morning.  Does that work for you guys? 
 It looks like this didn't go through last night. 
 We sent ISDA our comments a couple of weeks ago.  I have resent them to Corinne this morning and sent a copy to you.    Enron North America Corp. 
 We are scheduled at Ken Raisler's office at 9:00 on Thursday.  The address is 125 Broad Street (on the eastern end of Broad St. - right by the East River).  See you there! 
 Any thoughts on this Platt's issue? 
 I called and asked for an information packet on the Enron insurance plan (it is through MetLife) last week.  I will let you know as soon as it comes.  Thanks for the update on Tim & Sharon.  I guess the down-side of a 2 year old is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality, but the up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to learn a new language easily.  Feel free to let me know when the bank statement comes - I seem to remember that we came up with a scheme to deal with that last year.  I'll bet we can do it again!  And until then we can just bask in the light of this amazing run in the ENE stock price - wow! 
 January 7, 2000   Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85   A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ENTERTAINMENT   Filed at 3:21 p.m. EST  By The Associated Press  LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers, has died. He was 85.  O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book for several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not given and there were conflicting reports of the date.  The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but newspapers and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian had lived in France since 1949.  O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars.  A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles fought under sail.  The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the story of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much like sailing.  Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical fiction'' genre in which they generally were reviewed.  In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist you have never heard of.''  ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, praising ``the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting, and the brilliance of the writing.''  O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to engage the enemy.  A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but O'Brian didn't think definitions important.  ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he once said. ``Explanation almost certainly would be.''  O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to invent a new style of fiction.''  ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has described the whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical accuracy.''  O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions about his personal life.  He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and it wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily Telegraph said in an obituary Friday.  The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but changed his name in 1945. During his school years, he was frequently ill, spending much time reading. His writing career began at age 15, when he published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow leopard.  During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with Britain's Political Intelligence Department.  In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern France. His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956, about a Pacific expedition.  O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight home.  The rest, as they say, is publishing history.  Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 20th book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily Telegraph reported.  O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and Colette.  O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.  Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard, from his first marriage. 
 Here is a revised version - let me know what you think. 
 Adele,  Here is a revised version.  Let me know what you think.  Mark 
 This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private placement) in an internet/communications company.  My response was that Enron prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy commodity.  I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.  While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over the management of that competitor. 
 Good idea! 
 This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another.  Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like "Except as set forth under paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe master agreement shall prevail.  If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to "The agreements listed beloweach comprises a" or better yet "Each agreement listed below is a" rather than "The agreements listed below comprise the". 
 We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.  Counterparties with a North American financial master agreement should only map to North American financial products (including all weather and paper transactions). Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European derivative transactions.  Please call me or Tana if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Mark 
 I'm off to New York for a meeting but thought you might like to see this:  Wednesday January 12, 11:30 am Eastern Time  RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised  NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised Enron Corp's (NYSE:ENE - news) price target to $75 from $60 and cut 2000 earnings per share estimates.  -- raised price target because ``as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over the next 12 months, we anticipate that an additional $15 of value will be created for shareholders, with considerably greater value possible as the market develops.''  -- cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to fine-tuning." -- introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75. -- "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in  2000. Enron has built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in 2000."  -- ``Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in trading electricity and natural gas. After executing the first key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting rising transaction volumes, establishing the credibility of this new industry.''  -- ``The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise.'' 
 Would you guys please take a look at this and let me know what sorts of restrictions you would suggest we try and put on these guys and what sorts of legal disclaimers/notices should be on the site?  Thanks,  Mark 
 Looks like Mr. B has a late swim practice tonight so we won't be at Adobe :-(.  Maybe next time.  If I don't see you, have a very merry one and let's talk next week.  mark 
 Have you seen this? 
 The SRRS indicates there are no requests awaiting my approval. 
 The flyer didn't come through - do you have a copy? 
 Don't be too hard on him just yet.  Remember that we talked about many similar issues here when they first came up.  Maybe after we've been through these with him once he will negotiate them in the first case and only bring the tough sticking points to us. 
 Just so you know what may be coming, I have spent roughly half of my time in the office over the last six weeks negotiating these sorts of requests.  It is very time consuming.  My comments below in red.  Best of luck and feel free to call with any issues.  Mark 
 Approved 
 I have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ECFC version to the EOL people to be uploaded.  I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about. These GTC's use the defined term "Commercial Term" which is defined as follows:  "Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law that is issued in connection with a Transaction.  We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty (usually volume and price) and the Long Description.  We've gone to some lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long Description contain all of the necessary terms.  It's not clear to me that we intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of Commercial Terms.  Are these transactions not intended to be binding until the confirmation is signed?  Any thoughts on this? 
 Hey Mark - I thought you had my new (as of July 1997) address - sorry about that.  I'm now at:  1322 Rutland Houston, TX 77008  (713)863-7190 - home (713)853-7459 - work  I heard about Mrs. Boone in the Scots News.  I thought it was a nice write-up.  The Boones were very special people and I regret extremely that I didn't get to know them better.  Hope you guys are doing well.  I was in NYC in Nov. but was so busy I didn't have time for visits or fun of any kind!  Hope to get back soon but there's nothing for NY on the calendar.  Probably DC early Jan., London late Jan. and Buenos Aires and Sao Paolo in Feb.  I saw the magazine article (with such good photos!) a couple of months back.  My mom actually called to tell me about it.  Did you guys get my Christmas card?  I thought Celena might get a kick out of it.  Tell Debbie & Celena I said "Hi!"  Take care,  Mark T. 
 I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on various legal issues and company policies in trading.    Michael Etringer  01/14/2000 05:00 PM 
 I thought your Mom might like the first three. 
 January __, 2000    Via Facsimile  MEMORANDUM TO:=09Paul Simons=20 =09(Enron Europe Limited)=20 =09=20 =09Mark Taylor=20 =09(Enron North America Corp.) FROM:=09Kenneth M. Raisler=20 =09David J. Gilberg RE:=09Enron Online/Credit Product  This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our= =20 meeting on January 13, 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ= es=20 product (the =01&Product=018) to be offered by Enron Capital & Trade Resour= ces=20 International Corp. and its affiliates (collectively, =01&Enron=018) throug= h =01&Enron=20 Online=018.  These procedures, which we will be assisting you in preparing,= are=20 designed to reduce Enron=01,s exposure to those entities on whose credit th= e=20 Product will be based (the =01&Reference Entities=018) as well as Enron=01,= s exposure=20 to other related types of liabilities.  We have previously outlined these= =20 areas of exposure in our memoranda dated December 15, 1999 and December 22,= =20 1999. =20 1. Disclosure =01* All Reference Entities should be advised, by letter, of = the=20 fact that they will be included in the list of entities that will be the=20 subject of the Product.  These disclosures will of course be separate from,= =20 although related to, the disclosures to be provided to counterparties to=20 transactions in the Product.  ? This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of= =20 the Product, and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner = in=20 which it will be traded (e.g., through Enron Online).  ? In general, however, Enron need not request that the Reference Entities= =20 consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference=20 Entities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2.=20  2. Consent =01* Enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai= n=20 types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference= =20 Entities.  ? In particular, consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit= h=20 which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or= =20 other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t= he=20 Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha= t=20 could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme= nt.  ? Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20 counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron= =20 trades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar= =20 services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations.  ? Where consent is sought, Enron should include a request that the Referenc= e=20 Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20 included in the list of Reference Entities.  If a Reference Entity fails or= =20 refuses to execute the letter, Enron will need to make a determination, on = a=20 case-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o= n=20 the list of Reference Entities.  However, it should be recognized that, by= =20 requesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as= a=20 Reference Entity in the absence of consent.  3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc= t a=20 complete =01&Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product= and=20 Enron=01,s other trading activities.  This is due primarily to the fact tha= t=20 activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as= =20 Enron=01,s other trading activities.  However, Enron should implement a mod= ified=20 Chinese Wall between the trading operations.  This approach would enhance= =20 Enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety= or=20 breach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20 information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20 Product. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures.  ? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20 separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc= t,=20 on the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand= . =20 Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as= =20 other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the= =20 floor set off by partitions or similar features.  ? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio= n=20 between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t= o=20 the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20 domain.  In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe= ct=20 to the procedures through training programs.  ? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit= or=20 communications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20 determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would= =20 otherwise be prohibited under the procedures.  These procedures will be=20 similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ= ity=20 trading activities.  4. Restricted List -- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&restricted = list=018=20 of those entities on which Products may not be traded.  ? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i= s=20 not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20 relationships with such entities; e.g., those entities with respect to whic= h=20 Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their= =20 inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20 material, non-public information.  In addition, those entities with which= =20 Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to = be=20 excluded, depending on the terms of such agreements.  ? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20 information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20 Pursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation= s,=20 and therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20 Entity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20 regarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension= =20 necessary or advisable.  This would include situations in which Enron is=20 considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.  I= n=20 addition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud= ed=20 or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as= =20 well; e.g., where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20 respect to such Entities.=20  ? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for= a=20 Product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests= =20 Enron to do so.  The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20 closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th= at=20 minimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20 effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20 information.=20  ? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should= =20 include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi= th=20 any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the= =20 restricted list.=20  As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi= ll=20 need to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.  In= =20 addition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20 procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20 arising in connection with its offering of the Product.  However, the=20 implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr= on=20 in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by= =20 Reference Entities. Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues. =20  K.M.R.=20 D.J.G. 
 I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as well as prints.  I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll. 
 I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.  Just in case you are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes ago: Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.  He will appear on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end financial and operating highlights. 
 I would like to attend. 
 Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls.  My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity.  We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible. 
 Yes, I think they could develop some initial thoughts with that kind of description.    Michael Etringer  01/19/2000 04:40 PM

 Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday? If so, it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits.  I'm not sure exactly what it might be - possibly for slander or tortious interference with contract, something like that.  I could discuss it with our friend Richard Sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify the perpetrator. 
 Looks good to me - there is a chance that I will be out Feb 14 - 18. 
 The vacation time looks good to me.  My trip is nowhere near final yet so let's hold off on rescheduling the credit group lunch.  Don't come back until you're well!

Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.  Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day.  Wholesale Energy Business  Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March 2000.  EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000 transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction methods.  Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with expansions planned or underway on several of its systems.  Retail Energy Services  With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place to service customers worldwide. As the strong contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services' goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and energy services, nearly double the level in 1999.  Enron Broadband Services  The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.  A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model.  As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Internet services.  Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies. The company, which owns approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.''  This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries, the ability to penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband services markets, including the energy outsource market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of changes in interest rates, the timing and success of Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, communications, internet- related and other infrastructure projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements.

 I have sent an analyst's report on Enron as an attachment to your msn address. 
 Thanks for the presentation - well done! 
 Yes - I actually read that first - I guess now we really have to make it work. <g> 
 Here is the Strike Price Election Notice letter I drafted for the Ormet transaction.  Please let me know if this works for you. 
 I have put it on my calendar. 
 I should be here.  Nella can set something up with Taffy.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
 I don't see any problems.  It will become more challenging as we start thinking about trading. 
 Thanks for forwarding on the MSJ opinion.  Any objection to my sending it on to our US counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell) who are coordinating many of these issues for us? 
 In US financial trading (derivatives) we send the attachment each time, but it should only be 4 or 5 pages long.  This may be different in the physical trading world - I'll check into it. 
 It never ends. 
 Glad you liked them.  Yes, cats do seem to like to explore all sorts of spaces - grocery bags are always a good bet.  I remember Dusty, the cat we had in Bethesda, used to like to sleep at the foot of my bed - under the covers.  Go figure.  I'd be happy to send you acopy of the photo of me.  And yes again, the online platform mentioned in the analyst's report is the system I've spent so much time on over the last nine months or so.  It's kind of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to really make it work!  I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance.  I had a couple of questions which I called the company about (premiums, pre-tax vs. after tax, etc.) and would be happy to go over it with you.  Do you want me to send the stuff to you or should we just chart about it frst?  Love, Mark 
 FYI 
 II have tried to approve this through the Data Manager - not sure if it worked.  I know we must have been through this any number of times before but each time I read one of these I wonder how we are supposed to figure out the Notional Quantity.  It says "calculated from the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website" but how do we know how to calculate it?  Where does it say whether that number is a daily or monthly number?  Gallons or Barrels?  I remain confused. 
 My comments/suggestions below in red. As always, I'm happy to discuss. 
 Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?  The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy derivatives markets that would be helpful. 
 Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.  Let me know what you think. 
 Just a couple of comments and questions:  Is it appropriate to refer to these as "US" transactions since the prices are clearly from outside the US?  I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I think this may be confusing to our customers.  The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work for pulp transactions?].  I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current confirmations?  In the definition of the Index for the Finnish product, the word "relevent" should be deleted. 
 I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it definately a physical transaction?  where does the power get delivered?  If it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to look it over. 
 Here's one. 
 I have enlisted the assistance of Carol St. Clair to handle the ETA comments and negotiations.  I will be meeting with her this afternoon to go over the details of what we have been doing so far.  It would make sense for you to meet her at some point in the near future.  She is not a junior lawyer by any stretch and should be able to handle most issues that come up with minimal assistance.  In fact, as she becomes more familiar with EOL and its structure/issues generally, she will make a great back-up for me for all EOL issues. 
 There are about 15 - 20 pages you would probably want to see.  If that's not too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.  You can always call me from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of me.  It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys - it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been packed!).  Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but nothing is scheduled yet.  Love, Mark 
 Sorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not possible to provide for different online contracts for different counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459). 
 Any concerns? 
 Happy 1999 and welcome back.  Sorry to hear about your travel problems.  I know how much fun a night in the airport can be.  I'd be happy to talk about the US commodity laws at one of our group meetings.  I'm going to be in London the last week of this month - maybe we can set something up for then? 
 Yes, thanks - I think Tana is going to call to get some help interpreting the numbers. 
 Christian has not yet gotten back to me but I have asked him to check on the dates we discussed for early/mid March. 
 Do we know where J Aron wants us to settle the trade done from London?  If it is still settled by payment to New York, this one trade probably does not cause too much heartburn. (See the note from Steve Douglas in Tax next following.) 
 We have asked the EnronOnline team to send the Master User ID and Password to the person who signed the PA.  Our theory was that the signer presumably has the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the password can also bind the counterparty.  If they want to give it to someone else, so be it.  But we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due diligence on that name as we have on the PA signer.  I was told we were not looking into the authority of the "nominated" Master Users inn any way but that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the PA signers.  It just seemed safer to me to take this approach. 
 The package you sent arrived today.  I'll open it when I get home.  I sent the MetLife insurance materials by regular mail today. 
 These look ok to me but I think somebody who knows what they're talking about should look at them too. 
 Jeff:  Sorry for the delay - I'm still trying to track this down.  Obviously I don't know the answer right off and no one I've asked so far knows for sure (although those who know a little something about the area don't think it looks good).  I hope to have a final answer for you early next week.  Mark 
 How do these look to you? 
 You can ignore my previous e-mail. 
 My only concern is that the Floating Price is the Index for the Determination Period (which is a month) but the Index is a daily index.  Should we be taking the average for the month? 
 Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.  I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think? 
 The Thursday times look better for me. 
 That looks good to me. 
 Here's another one. 
 This may be one of the things we have to deal with in connection with the SA restructuring.  In the past it was easy enough to justify using Don's budget since in theory all of your work was for his benefit.  Now it isn't quite so clear.  I think we need to figure out exactly who you are supporting - is there a separate RC for Argentina trading? 
 I sent the web address of the address of the site we were talking about last week as part of another e-mail(1/27).  This is just to check and make sure you knew it was there and have been able to access the site. 
 The web site address is at the bottom. 
 Dear Schuyler:  It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney people on swap documentation.  We used to send our new lawyers and more experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more experienced lawyers to the advanced course.  It appears that Euromoney is no longer putting this on.  Are you doing something similar through another provider?  Mark Taylor 
 The system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could probably draft around it on a case by case basis.  It strikes me that while we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, the credit considerations are more problematic.  I would guess that the back office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the trades.  This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some respects.  When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the appropriate headroom.  I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would  that be acceptable to everyone?  Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.  That would let them do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other entities.  Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for credit on its own somehow.  Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would be difficult (upstream guarantee problems). 
 We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece together the following:  Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline (note spelling) trading page.  Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA and ETA executed.  Other users will be given a user ID and password that give them "guest" access to EnronOnline and trading access to the auction page.  On the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact (either to buy or sell) with Enron.  The page will list a reserve price and identify the number of credits to be auctioned.  We are willing to commit to transact up to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve  price) but may transact larger volumes if we choose.  Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of winning bidders.  Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full amount of their offer to buy.  It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction period but we would like to have that option.  I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.  Harry is preparing the "GTC" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on our standard contracts for these products.  We need to put the legal framework together for the rest of it.  If the existing PA and ETA are adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind. We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of paper.  It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those counterparties would make sense.  Can we talk on Monday? 
 Just out of curiosity, who is Thomas Geisel?  I assume he is an Enron=20 person.  Do we already have a lawyer responsible for these issues?  I seem = to=20 remember that Robert and Justin were handling the IPE and Martin and Mark= =20 Elliott the NordPool and ELEX issues.  It might make sense to have one pers= on=20 be the go-to guy for exchange issues with another designated for each=20 exchange.  What do you think?  It worries me a little to have only business= =20 people involved - particularly if this is an early stage where we may have= =20 our best hope for effective legal input. 
 Just on the off chance you haven't had enough regarding EnronOnline to think about recently, Louise has announced meetings on Thursday and Friday of this week to discuss "Phase II" of the project.  It seems like an opportune time to come up with our wish-list of possible changes to the site and the legal structure. 
 I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but here it is. 
 That sounds right to me - we were going to pay for extra trips (like the ENA legal conference int eh fall) but this meeting is for all lawyers so they would have to pay for this regardless. 
 Jan:  Thanks for your note.  Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.   JAN M KING 02/09/2000 12:30 PM 
 The second product listed here is physical.  It looks ok to me but I don't really know - can you take a look and approve it or comment to Dale please?  Thanks! 
 Here's another one. 
 I have not received any comments.  I consider it final.  Let me know if you need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.  Since I don't know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they need it you send them copies. 
 Here is S&C's first draft. 
 Mark Haedicke and I are scheduled to participate in an ISDA sponsored conference call which begins at 9:00 Eastern time tomorrow morning.  If that call runs over, we may not be able to call you promptly at 10:00 but will call as soon as we can. 
 Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the "auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?  Mark 
 I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri). 
 Are either of you guys aware of this web-site?  It looks like our weather people have put this out on the web ahead of us.  I think we need to talk to them about what they are allowed to post and what sorts of disclaimers should be there as well.  I just wanted to check with you before I call the weather desk here  Mark 
 Paul is out sick today - I'll see what I can find out tomorrow. 
 Collateral Arrangements. Counterparty shall (at Enron=01,s request) either:= (i)=20 within one Business Day of such request by Enron, provide to Enron a letter= =20 of credit in respect of Counterparty's obligations under any Transaction, i= n=20 such form and for such amount and from such issuer, as is acceptable to Enr= on=20 in its absolute discretion; or (ii) within such period as is specified by= =20 Enron, provide for the benefit of Enron a parent company guarantee in such= =20 form and for such amount as is acceptable to Enron in its absolute=20 discretion. Failure so to provide such letter of credit or parent company= =20 guaranty shall constitute a default hereunder giving rise to the immediate= =20 right of termination by Enron under this GTC. 
 Here are my comments (together with my voice mail comment to Dave regarding an earlier deletion). 
 Here are the procedures toegther with our comments.  If you have access to Word, you can see the changes and who made them. 
 I'm afraid I disagree with Justin but prefer not to do so publicly.  It seems to me we need a verifiable end time for the Auction Period and should choose a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties (presumably UK for EnBank but Central for emissions credits). 
 Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade UK derivatives should have access.  Mark 
 It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.  They want this auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the expiration time.  There is still no commitment to sell anything.  All transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.  I have taken a stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind. 
 Would you please check and see if we have any JEDI swaps wtih these counterparies? 
 Here's a stab at tthe procedures which provides for hte ability to revise or revoke bids during the auction period.  Comments? 
 FYI 
 I'm not sure which "process" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is unclear).  The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US. For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on both sides of the walls. 
 With the final comment from Sullivan & Cromwell: 
 Is this a document that is available generall?  If so, can we get a copy? 
 Yes, this looks better to me. 
 FYI 
 I'm not sure I agree with you.  There is a big difference between listing the price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high ground if the reference entity later decides to object. 
 I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use the camera - and thought you might like these.  Unfortunately the only shot on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group shot.  There were several others that you can tell would have been great shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.  The sunset was taken during our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing his lunch down below).  Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?  Mark 
 Edmund:  Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of questions and minor points ont eh GTC -  In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed confirmation to control over other evidence.  Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters.  I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is this particular to credit derivatives?  With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to "deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction? If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control.)  I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 60 days).  I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March. The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention.  This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a different interest rate to non-US$ payments?  It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.  Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason?  Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points.  Mark 
 Jennifer:  Our records indicate that a draft was delivered to you earlier this week.  If you do not have it, please let Marie Heard (x33907) know and she can get you another copy.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 There are a few points in here that you might be interested in - or not. 
 I received the proposed list of reference entities today.  Here is a draft of a memo that I cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others within Enron for the restriced list.  Would you let me know what you think? I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it.  It isn't clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come.  Since the communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is Kristina the right person?  I know that EES has some kind of joint venture with AOL - should Vicki sign off?  If it is going to such persons, should the memo come from Mark?  Cliff Baxter?  John Sheriff?  Jim Derrick? 
 Enron North America and Enron Europe will offer credit derivatives through= =20 the EnronOnline website in the near future.  These products will provide fo= r=20 regularly scheduled payments by the purchaser and a payment by the seller i= n=20 the event of the bankruptcy of a specified =01&Reference Entity.=018 =20  For a number of reasons, including those identified below, Enron maintains = a=20 =01&Restricted List=018 in connection with its credit derivatives business,= which=20 will list those entities that may not be included in the list of Reference= =20 Entities or that have been deleted from the list of Reference Entities.

 My recollection is that we did this on purpose - that the industry works this way for all participants (or nearly all) so we built our documents to reflect that practice.  Do I remember correctly? 
 I just called Diomedes' office to try and get on his calendar next week. They told me he is not there and won't be back until after Carnival which I guess means March 9 at the earliest.  I am in Portland the 6th & 7th (Mon. & Tues.) and Amsterdam the 13th - 17th (Tues. - Fri.).  Unless an emergency comes up it looks like the earliest I can reasonably expect to make it will be towards the end of March (27 - 31?). 
 Here is the list of reference entities I received from Debbie with the confidentiality agreements and the reference entities they relate to indicated.  If the reference entity name is in bold we have a confidentiality agreement with the entity itself. I notice that AOL, Nortel and Qwest are not on the list (they were on the original list for actual trading sent to me) - were they removed by you guys?

 Brent - what is your home number?  You can get me at the office today (Monday until around lunch time, then you can try my cell phone 713-206-8080. 
 I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make sure the second item listed in them works.  Is everyone comfortable that the volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce megawatt hours?  I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - it wasn't immediately obvious to me.

 This is getting a bit confusing - is this list included in Bryan's "Final" list? 
 Should we have Alan in this as well? 
 Looks fine to me. 
 These look ok.  I'm still unhappy with using an average of the index for each day when there is only one index for the entire month but I guess we're stuck with it for now. 
 Also fine - with the same "averaging" concern. 
 This one looks like it is in the "rejected" category.  How should I proceed? 
 My only concern is that it looks like we are modifying the NYMEX price twice - once in the second sentence and then again in th definition of Index. 
 Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light). 
 Carol:  As Tana mentioned in our meeting, the Credit guys are in discussions with Aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap (we think it should be JEDI, they think it should be ECT).  There is a master agreement in place between JEDI I and Inland (which suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been transferred and still binds JEDI I).  Mark 
 I have read the Lucent CA and it is OK to go ahead and keep them on the list - the CA seems to cover a relatively small transaction and expires on March 25 anyway.  We are in the process of pulling the CA's for Dow, DuPont, GE, IMC, 3M, Pitney Bowes, Praxair and Sprint.

 Too bad you didn't call when you got in - I wasn't able to find Mr. B until about 8 - we missed the first half but went anyway.  Have you guys been up to anything fun lately?  Did you know T has a new job?  He's at an internet start-up called iVita. 
 He's doing PR and IR for them - what they do isn't entirely clear to me - something to do with accounting software I think.  They are going to launch a web site next month.  We'll have to get together and let him give you all the details.

 What is the list of proposed Reference Entities for EnronOnline (to go live March 8?)? 
 Richard - do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending litigation?  How should we handle these?  Mark 
 Peter:  I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as collateral in Canada.  We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.  Would you mind checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary office)?  I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens on ourselves that aren't required by law.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Do any of you guys know about this deal? 
 Paul -  Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the list that Michael referred to.  The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.  Mark 
 Did you get a chance to look at the Credit GTC? 
 Carol St. Clair will be the swap lawyer for this transaction. 
 This is the site you had trouble looking at a few weeks ago - I had to send the address a couple of times. 
 Thanks - I needed a good smile today. 
 Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.    Enron North America Corp. 
 There are still certain jurisdictions where we are not offering the product: Germany and Canada come to mind. 
 Richard:  In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Bryan -  In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a variety of people.  Mark 
 David -  The Password Application and ETA look fine to me.  Mark 
 That is correct. 
 It never ends. 
 Do you want legal bills for this aspect of the project sent through on the EnronOnline work order or separately? 
 Thanks for your card and hello to the whole family.  I didn't know you guys were in Mass.  Is this a long term move?  Things are still pretty much the same in Houston.  We'd certainly look forward to seeing more of you down this way! 
 As we discussed, attached is the new list of proposed reference entities.  I have also attached my previous memo outlining the propsosed business and our concerns. 
 Can we do the call at 3:00 Houston time? 
 I'll be there - is it really only to last 2 hours? 
 Why is Enron's stock so volatile now? Since today's session started, ENE has lost another $2.50!  Mr. Ken Lay replies I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several reasons it's more volatile. But before I comment on that, our stock price is still up even if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the year when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off the table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a growth stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, just like all the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market, technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but often $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility on the upside, but I hate it on the down side.  We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's being bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and put it back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little nervous, but this is probably the world we're in now. I'd rather be in this world with a 50 P/E than the more stable world with a 20 P/E. 
 I have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com page.  That process is now underway.  Going forward, I would hope that we will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites before a reference entity is used. 
 I'm not sure anyone told you about this - can you make it on Friday? 
 I'm not sure what "penalites" they're referring to.  I assume it's a physical concept.   If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right person.  If it's gas, probably Stacy. 
 Please give me a call and we can discuss.  Shari is now definately moving to power trading (not public yet) so we really need to figure out how we are going to cover all the bases - short and long term.  I will be out the 14th through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.  It would be grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself that much.  Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is covered. 
 I am not available at all on Friday through Tuesday but the meeting can go ahead without me if necessary.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is a set of disclaimers for your website.  Have you looked into getting the name trademarked?  If not, let me know and I can try and move that along from here. 
 Sorry - it looks like I can not attend.  My travel schedule is pretty tight this month - do you think it makes sense to set something up for April?    Enron North America Corp. 
 David -  I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.  Thanks,  Mark 
 That's perfect - let's aim for May - thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 Ken:  Mark H. asked me to forward to you this initial draft term sheet.  We would like to talk to you, and presumably one of your colleagues, tomorrow regarding the possible antitrust implications of the proposed structure. Please give me a call and we can schedule a time.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Moses, Jesus and an old man are golfing. Moses steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto the green.  Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the water and chips the ball onto the green.  The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth. As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.  Jesus turns to the old man and says, "Dad, if you don't stop fooling around, we won't bring you next time." 
 Dave - Do we have a copy of this marked to show the changes fromt he NA ETA? 
 I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement. 
 May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single page.  This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid out here.  I was also under the impression that a completed registration form was required before a user ID and password could be issued.  While I don't object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form. 
 Then from a legal perspective I don't have any issues.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Edmund -  I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives (I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can discuss my concerns? 
 Ken - here is another (brand new) issue Mark H. asked me to forward on to you that he would like to discuss this afternoon in the anti-trust call. 
 This looks good to me.  Thanks! 
 I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:  1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron relationships.  3. Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the "other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns. Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).  Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only offered pursuant to an unsolicited request. 
 Rod - can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it is related to the Duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality agreements listed below?  I need to know who the parents are and who the subsidiaries are and, if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the reference entity.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Tana -  Please forward copies of the ETA and PA to Paul Davis (e-mail address above).  If you don't have them in your directory, Frank Davis should be able to get them to you.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Martin:  My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 38th floor.  The room number is EB3850.  Sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to HR about a badge.  HR should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.  If it isn't and your HR person is not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to let you in.  Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.  If you haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on Monday morning.  They are more reasonably priced than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract).  We're looking forward to seeing you!  Have a good trip.  Mark 
 Yes, this is fine with me. 
 Edmund:  Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.  I don't think it makes sense to review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.  Please let me know if the situation changes.  Mark 
 Can I get a copy?  I don't really know what we're talking about. 
 Rod - I got your voice mail & we can talk when I get back.  Here is a note I sent to Edmund last week with a suggestion - let me know what you think. 
 I certainly haven't seen anything and there is nothing in our database - you might check with Shari Stack (I'm in Portland until Wed.). 
 Lori - here is the initial "wish list" from the credit derivatives people. If you can focus on these first and let me know about them I'd appreciate it. 
 Any idea what Bryan plans to gain this way?  It's not clear to me that a hard wall solves our problems with RE approvals but that's because I don't know. Maybe Ken can shed some light on this. 
 David -  Thanks for your note.  Just to keep you posted - I plan to be there with my boat but will return to my slip at Kemah Harbor and drive over to the party so I won't add to the size of your raft.  Mark 
 What time is the game on Saturday? 
 I have received reactions from several of the other Enron operating companies (EBS, EES and GPG) requesting that the following entities be placed on the Restricted List for credit derivatives Reference Entities:  AT&T Corp. Baltimore Gas & Electric Company Bell Atlantic Corporation BellSouth Corp. Cable & Wireless plc Comdisco, Inc. Cox Communications, Inc. Intel IBM Lucent Technologies Monsanto SBC Communications Sun Microsystems Union Carbide Viacom Wisconsin Electric Power Company Wisconsin Gas Company  These companies were those on the attached list (forwarded to the various General Counsels on 2/28) which were found to be objectionable for one reason or another.  I have not yet heard from the former EI companies. 
 Mark - This doesn't look familiar to me - is it yours? 
 I have not been given any reasons - the most "considered" list came from EBS where I feel sure some of them were commercial.  I'm not so sure about the EES and GPG lists.  These lists are going to some fairly senior people.  I'm a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary.  My suggestion would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you particularly want to list. 
 We had hoped to have an answer from local counsel in Japan by the end of last week.  Unfortunately we have not yet heard from them.  Alan Aronowitz has sent an e-mail asking for an update on their progress.  As soon as we have their answers to our questions, we will be able to prepare an ETA for counterparties trading from Japan. 
 Hi Mary.  Barbara tells me there's a better-than-good chance you will be coming back to join the department.  Hooray!  I was hoping we could chat about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time around.  I'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when I get back and you should feel free to talk to Carol and Sara in the meantime.  Mark T. 
 Mark H. suggested this morning that he, you and I should plan on getting together for dinner on Thursday evening.  I'm leaving for the airport here in a few minutes and will be reachable in Amsterdam at the Grand Hotel or on my mobile - 44-7881-512-535. 
 Hmmm. - Barbara wasn't 100% sure of your e-mail address....... 
 one more try..... 
 I will not be able to attend Thursday's call. 
 Did we ever talk about this?  The traders (Bob Crane in particular) are giving Dale a hard time - they want to start trading this way immediately. 
 my comments made below 
 Just between you and me, I'm astonished -- delighted but astonished, that they fugured their way through all of those Japanese holidays and the aftermath.  I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I haven't read it yet.  I don't anitcipate any problems.  I can't tell from these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11 or going live for Japanese counterparties then (all of whom must then have already executed PAs and been approved). 
 Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.  I'll coordinate through QD. 
 I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular publication?  If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and check for older prices there and you can cite to that.  Let me know if that doesn't work. 
 Do we have a Netherlands ETA? 
 That's fine with me. 
 David:  Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by non-Australian counterparties.  The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process going forward.  Any chance you might be available for a telephone conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?  Mark

 Pets In the Office It's A Growing Trend  In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some companies. Workers are bringing their pets to the office.  Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has been taking his golden retriever, Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early Show and talked with Co-Anchor Jane Clayson.  The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. "He brings a lot of emotion and people love it. He's very relaxed."  But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to the office if he wishes. Not everybody can bring their pet to work.  "A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not a rowdy dog.  "He just hangs out," explains Paucek. "He's easy to get along with."  Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife brings him in and drops him off at the office," Paucek says.  While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also many legal issues to consider. John Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing.  "More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," says Challenger  He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy.  "One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a policy like that, is take a poll of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain employees that don't feel comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy."  There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee.  "The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect," says Challenger. "The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone, it can't be the company's fault."  Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office.  "Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, will you put them in a certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? Many don't feel comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats and dogs and what about birds? What about the noise of birds?"  Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, "It gets chaotic."  In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. They found that:  21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the job 33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals   If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should:  poll employees before they let the pets come provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office establish an off-limits-to-pets area make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times   If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should make a rotating schedule.  When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when he and Hoss arrive at work, "I get off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the employees. He has his own web page." 
 This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an objection. 
 This doesn't seem to allow me to approve. 
 Here is the e-mail we received from ISDA.  Since we only have $500 left and they are suggesting $1000 for the lunch, I'm not sure it makes sense to send someone.  I've left a voice-mail for Stacey to ask where they stand and whether or not they still want us to send someone. 
 Hey guys!  Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!  I'm still working at Enron in Houston - it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.  I'm in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and issues.  I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well.  I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but haven't heard from him since.  Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New York managing a couple of international mutual funds.  He & Debbie adopted a little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in the middle of Manhattan.  I get up there on business a few times a year and try to stop in to say hi.  I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class "reunion" last June.  There were only 2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!  Oh well, maybe the 25th will be a bigger draw.  C.F.&S., Mark 
 Stacy Carey called back to say that the $500 would appreciated as would a person to attend.  I didn't know if you had anyone who could go so I suggested that someone from your office call her on Monday morning to discuss details.  Stacy's number is (202)457-6545. 
 Cynthia:  Here is a first draft of an agenda for our meeting this afternoon.  Mark 
 Here is the revised Koch confirmation marked to show the changes. 
 I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date as the Buyer Payment Date.  In the version I send to Koch I will change that to Trade Date.  You can always change it to a later date if you want to tomorrow. 
 I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC. 
 Attached is the confirmation revised to include Ken's most recent comments. 
 Tana - please mark up the draft with these comments so I can see what they look like. 
 Jay -  Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.  The problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.  Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate regarding the services they provide to us?  Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be trying to do this the "right" way.  Mark   James Bruce   03/30/2000 02:33 AM 
 There are no requests awaiting my approval. 
 Thanks for the messages - I have not heard anything since they left.  VERY good news! 
 Scott:  The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.  Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.  Thanks,  Mark 
 I'm not sure - I thought we were not adding any products -- just opening existing products to Japanese counterparties.  Is he talking about the existing GTC's for petroleum products?

 Are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in Monmouth next week?  I'm setting up dinner with Doc (instead of the Private Dining Room affair) in case you're interested. 
 When I try to open the link I get an error message saying "You are not authorized to perform that operation."  There are still no requests awaiting my approval in the SRRS icon on my desktop.  Sorry! 
 Doc:  The schedule calls for the meetings to end at 5:00.  There's also a play (The Merry Wives of Windsor) that night and we can work around that if you were planning on going.  Mark 
 Thanks for forwarding all of this stuff - so far it has all been mine.  I think your name must come up automatically for some of these folks when they just type in Mark Taylor.  It's not nearly as bad as when there was another Mark E Taylor - and he wasn't nearly as nice about it either (instead of forwarding them to me, he would send them back to the senders with sometimes nasty notes like 'try to get it right next time').   Luckily for both you and me he is no longer with Enron -- can you imagine how bad it would be if there were three of us?  When I get these, I usually send a note back to the sender letting them know that there are two of us and they need to pay attention when addressing things to one or the other.  Mark 
 "Good meal" in Monmouth?  Not sure if that is really possible by your standards.  I had the Barnstormer in mind.  It pretty much has to be better than the food at the Stockdale Center. 
 You might want to take a read through this one more time just to make sure I have it the way you want it. 
 We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact them.  Thanks for you help.  Mark 
 Approved. 
 I had a note back from Doc asking if we wanted to go to the play after dinner.  If we're not interested he can go on Sunday but if we want to go he'll get us tickets.  I can go either way - what do you think? 
 Thanks for your note - I'll keep those items in mind.  It seems pretty clear to me that the Pres. has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and some gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed.   I asked Mark Kopinski, who is also coming to the planning meeting, if he wanted to join us for dinner so I've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the play or not - I'll let you know what he says - I have mixed feelings since I'd like to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent chatting. 
 Please order enough books for the swaps group and a few extras. 
 Alan:  Regarding the legal comments below:  My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:  i.e. the umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice of law provision.  These agreements have been approved by local counsel in Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that bridge is still ahead of us.  I don't know what the "international contracts" are that Rousseau refers to. There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions. The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed.  In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go.  Mark 
 Rousseau:  I have copied you on an e-mail to Alan Aronowitz which may answer your questions.  If not, please feel free to call and we can discuss your issues. If I am not at hand when you call, my assistant can book a particular time on my calendar so we won't be trading calls forever.  Mark 
 Mark K thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets for us that would be great.  My flight out isn't until around 11:00 Friday morning so I can always stay up late to chat!  I'll be there Thursday morning, too - I'm supposed to attend a lecture at 11 but am free before that - any Chemistry classes or labs I should sit in on?  Mark 
 Any further news from Russia?  There's a good chance I'll have to go to DC for a day tomorrow & if they're back I might be able to get up there to see them - I could try and get an early enough flight tomorrow afternoon that I could spend the evening with them. 
 FYI 
 What do you think?  OK with me, although I think I'm supposed to leave for South America on Sunday evening (gone 5 days or so - this is the trip that has been postponed twice already so I won't be surprised if it is delayed again). 
 Nobody is leaving - it's a new position. 
 Allison -  I don't think they were expecting Cynthia to attend these meetings with me - there will only be one representative from each of the three companies.  I did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me though and to know I was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone else.  My flight out isn't until after 7:00 pm. and I assume that the Luken meeting will be over around 3:00.    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI 
 Just a heads up - Mark H. asked me to set up a day that he and I could come to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over EnronOnline.  I'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential dates. 
 Hey Marc! - We're in town this weekend - let us know if you plan something. 
 Mario -  We have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the EnronOnline launch in Japan.  The advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements are enforceable under the law chosen (e.g. New York for the PA and ETA) they should be enforceable in Japan as well.  Local counsel is aware of our business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls.  We have not looked into the registration of domain names in Japan.  Please let me know if this is required.  Mark 
 Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the airport in Minneapolis.  I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital campaign planning committee meeting.  Mark Kopinski was there and he and I had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. professors) who is still teaching.  I'm now on my way back to Houston - flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.  Hope you are well.  Love,  Mark 
 Are you sure about this?  I didn't know I had a NY bar number. 
 Looks good to me. 
 Robbi:  The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill (bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you. Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.  Mark 
 I don't think this one will work for us - we would prefer a college degree. 
 Angelica lacks an undergraduate degree. 
 Yes, so far that is the plan. 
 The PA and ETA for Japanese counterparties will be identical to those for North America unless they need revision for some commercial reason.  I will try and get to the FAQ's tomorrow. 
 Sorry I didn't get to you today - I have kept a slot on my calendar at 9:00 Houston time tomorrow if that works for you. 
 I will not be able to attend. 
 I will be out the 5th but plan to be here the 12th and 24th. 
 I have not - happy to coordinate with you. 
 See my answers below. 
 Can't we just transfer the billing to me? 
 Alvin:  It was good to meet you at lunch the other day.  Here are my address details if you need them.  Mark E. Taylor Enron North America Corp. (EB3889) 1400 Smith St. Houston, TX 77002  (713)853-7459  Mark.Taylor@enron.com 
 We generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties - regarding tax or other legal consequences to their trading.  The only thing we could safely say would be something to the effect of "If you are concerned about the tax consequences of your EnronOnline transactions, please consult your tax advisor." 
 Here are my FAQ comments - all of the existing answers are still correct. 
 Nedre:  We have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one of them - the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's reactions to the interviews.  If you have other resumes we would be happy to look at them - my own view is that while these candidates would be OK, they are not superstars (like the person we are losing).  Mark 
 Stanford:  My only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the exchange consents - that would mean changing the date to September 7, 2000 at the end of the sentence.  Otherwise it all looks good to me.   I will forward everything on to Mark Holsworth for his final review - particularly with respect to the affiliates issue.  Thanks very much for your help in getting this done.  Mark 
 Mark:  Here is the most recent draft of the Reuters document.  You will see that while they didn't give us everything we asked for, they made significant progress on the indemnity.  I'm not sure they have satisfied your concern regarding the Enron affiliates issues - they have added in subsidiaries in several places but refused to change the definition of "Distributor" to include affiliates.  If you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through (to see all of the marked changes) let me or Dave Samuels know and we can forward them to you (I think there were at least 4 versions since the draft we discussed with them the other day).  Since I will be in Brazil on Monday, it might make sense for you to coordinate your reactions with Dave.  If you need me, please leave a voice-mail or ask  my assistant (Taffy x57373) to track me down.  Mark 
 Hi Dave:  Thanks for your note!  It's hard to believe that Washington House was over twenty years ago now.  I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law school in Michigan.  My first job after graduating was for a law firm in Houston.  They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to help out.  The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total.  One of those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong. I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues. We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit periodically.  I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping them get some products ready to trade online.  I get back to Washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 11th & 12th.  I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C. from time to time.  Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for American Century.  I was on the Alumni Board for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch very well.  There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations.  And I understand there are big plans for more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library. Enrollment is up above 1000.  Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well! There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look.  I guess we really did learn something while we were there.  Let me know if you ever get to Texas.  It would be fun to get together and catch up.  Mark Taylor 1322 Rutland St. Houston, TX 77008 (713)863-7190(home) (713)853-7459(work)
