hanks for letting me know it was still an issue.  Mark 
 The system won't let me connect to approve your reviewers from outside the office.  I'll do it first thing Wednesday morning but since they'll only have 2 days left to fill out the forms at that point, if there are any you particularly want, I suggest you call or e-mail them to let them know it is coming. 
 Unfortunately I am already booked for Wednesday. 
 Taffy - please print this out for the EnronOnline file. 
 What a great poem!  Sorry for the confusion on getting together - I'll try to start earlier next time. 
 Have you guys seen this?  http://www.tviweb.com/cgi-bin/texis/newdotcom/dotcom_main3/++wwBmevCSC6qwwwxFq DyODntOayoGnqBqFqVRrna0DnGtOagdDDnqBodD/bus_details.html 
 Bob - These are the only versions I have in Word format - they were probably modified slightly in the online version (e.g. Enron party is now EnronOnline LLC). 
 Thanks for your note - that will make packing easier.  My flight is CO4240 from Houston Intercontinental Airport arriving at 10:29 Wednesday night - operated by Continental Express.  I don't like to take those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop flight.   It makes for fewer delays and it's that much harder for them to lose your luggage. 
 Please send a copy of the Energy Gateway docs to Luis Derrota - EB838. 
 If they've done it, it was without consulting me.  Other than the content stuff (e.g. which provide links to Reuters) I don't think there is anything out there yet.    Travis McCullough 11/20/2000 09:03 PM

 It's possible that someone in Alan Aronowitz's groups has looked into similar issues.    Steve Kim 11/20/2000 01:54 PM 
 Please let me know when the vaccine is available. 
 We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term Capital Management debacle of last year.  These same issues may not apply in the UK.    Marie Westin 11/20/2000 05:23 AM 
 Here is the first draft. 
 Yes, I'd like the tickets if they're available. 
 I don't know if this will be helpful or not.... 
 Done - sorry for the delay. 
 Glad you liked it.  There is a while series of e-mail symbols people use like smiley faces - they even have a name: emoticons.  They don't often look like you'd expect and most of them are sideways -  only one I know is the smiley face  :-)   Hope you had a nice birthday!  Love , Mark 
 Let me know if this is not what you need.

 I decided I needed the book we discussed so I went online to Amazon.com and ordered it!  While there I found references to a number of books I tought you might be interested in:  the Hornblower series by C.S. Forester the Bolitho stories from Alexander Kent the Drinkwater series from Richard Woodman (e.g., "An Eye of the Fleet") the Ramage series from Dudley Pope Revolution at Sea Trilogy/James L. Nelson Lobscouse & Spotted Dog : Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels by Anne Chotzinoff Grossman, Lisa Grossman Thomas 
 I'll be there.

 I won't need the final locations until Joya has to submit the churn request. Since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 12/22 I wouldn't think we'd need it until the 15th - Joya will have a better feel for how far in advance we need to schedule the churn.  The legal assistants (and any lawyers who start before the construction is done) will be put in the cubes we have.  When we run out of cubes we have space to build more.

 Here is the revised BETA - let me know what you think.  The changes are marked in blue. 
 Here is the BETA with our initial comments. 
 As we discussed a couple of weeks ago...... 
 Tammy:  Brent still reports to me and I believe he should be paid from my RC.  Please let me know if this causes a problem.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Can one of you guys handle this in Stacy's absence? 
 Does this raise uncertainty for products offered by non-banks? 
 This looks ok to me.    Melba Lozano 12/06/2000 04:46 PM 
 These look OK to me.    Andrew Wilson@ENRON 12/08/2000 11:11 AM 
 FYI 
 Peter:  Here is our first attempt at EnronOnline Long Description language for the double transaction calendar spread product.  We had to guess at several aspects. Please let me know if we got close.  Mark 
 Thanks so much for the Christmas present.  Everyone is enjoying it very much.  Bob Bruce's first reaction was "Wow -- I hope this isn't in lieu of her ever coming back!" 
 Marc:  In what currency will the proposed DPC hedge be denominated? 
 So now it's clear? 
 I thought I'd send this around just as a reminder of the RMT guidelines.  As far as I know these have not changed since Rhett's memo last year. 
 Approved. 
 Thanks for your notes.  Just so you know, I have the Polo Sport perfume and a Victoria's Secret gift certificate for Emily.  Were there lists for you and Dad?  I can't seem to find them. 
 My feeling is we stand by our confirmation - what do you think? 
 Maybe we can chat about this first draft this afternoon. 
 With my revisions. 
 This confirmation should have the regular Omnibus Annex A attached as well as the additional Chilean Annex which Tana forwarded last week.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Mark     Craig Breslau 12/13/2000 01:51 PM 
 In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a slightly revised version.  Also attached is a revised BETA.  The changes marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).  Unfortunately I didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked. 
 Bob:  Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere.  The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]  For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons).  Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot.  Mark    Bob Shults 12/12/2000 10:26 AM 
 One of the areas causing us legal heart-burn in the weather derivatives area here in the States is the insurance and re-insurance company counterparties. In most states there are different laws applicable to insurance companies - most of which are regulated - including entirely separate insolvency regimes.  Just another item for your radar screen. 
 I'll be there! 
 One of the problems with Indian derivatives is that when foreign exchange is involved, Reserve Bank of India approval is required in advance of the transaction.  A $US deal would involve foreign exchange from an Indian counterparty's point of view.  Certain transactions have pre-approved status but an ECT commodity swap is not one of them.  I'm still trying to track down whether a commodity deal can be done at all, even with RBI approval.   I've also asked whether, if approved commodity swaps are permitted but not by ECT, it might  be possible to use an Indian bank or other approved dealer as an intermediary.

 Brent:  Thanks very much for this report - these are VERY helpful in keeping me up to date on what's happening in your part of the world.  Mark 
 Yes - it's definitely time to think about this.  My suggestion would be that we try to get Don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary regardless of who she was working for (EI or ECT).  Of course, if he balks, we'll foot the bill. 
 Robert:  I believe that Sylvia Sauseda usually handles these matters.  Please let us both know the date you will be arriving with as much notice as possible so that we can have things ready for you.  We're looking forward to seeing you! 
 Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, insertions in bold).  Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any questions or comments:  A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option contracts. SP:  What's a futures contract? A:  It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of  commodity through a regulated  exchange. SP:  How is the contract different than a non-futures contract? A:  Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts.  The big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not. SP:  I though the futures contracts went to delivery.  I remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards? A:  Well, er,  yes they do sometimes  go to delivery, but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.  They are supposed to more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial transactions.  It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract. SP:  Well lets get to the point,  why are physical buy sells so bad? A:  That's easy.  Because they look like futures contracts.  They are not intended to go to delivery.  And if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. SP:  So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC? A:  You've got it.  But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing.  So you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option. SP:  Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract? A:  What do you mean? SP:  Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 29 days, would we have a futures contract? A:  Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.   I'm telling you once and for all that physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the hell out of my office!--  Is this the basic idea and if so,  how much can we blend physical into it to cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?  --Christian  Basically, yes.  A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also the parties' intentions.  If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to settle financially, we have a problem.  The closest thing we have to an exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to deliver.  That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.  We argue that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when there is a failure to make or take delivery.  Unfortunately, in the power world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.  However, each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.  The book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the book-out.  In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery (although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time). 
 I am also admitted in New York which has recently instituted a CLE requirement. 
 FYI 
 Marc,  I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of L/C we would require.  Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.  Let me know if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away - shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.  Mark 
 Marc,  Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those copied on your note to me.  What do you think?  Marc,  We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.  We have had that advice updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.  The result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the transaction can proceed.  While I have no legal objection to sending a form of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.  Mark 
 Debbie:  I think we should probably do a special form for this particular transaction.  I've left a voice-mail to Marc to that effect.  There are several issues here that don't exist in our run-of-the-mill deals that should be covered in the L/C language.  Mark 
 In light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts, the Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the field. We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing, so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.  We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.  It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.  Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung. Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper.   You guys around this weekend? 
 We have asked for a legal opinion from the counterparty's Indian counsel but have not received it yet.  That's the reason I'd like to do a special form of L/C - we need to add some language that indicates enforceability of the underlying agreement is not a prerequisite to a draw. 
 Marc - I know Bill well - give me a call (713)853-7459.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Hmmm, interesting question.  Most of the guys I've interviewed have gotten dressed up even on casual days, but then we're pretty causal every day so it's hard to tell.  I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.  That department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you have a pretty good excuse.  It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be seeing.  The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is always in a suit & tie.  If you're also talking to him it might make sense to bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview. 
 Sorry for the delay - we won't be able to go with you tomorrow night - hope you have fun anyway!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Dan -  I left you a voice mail about this contract.  Can you let me know who the best person would be to review one of these for Brent?  Thanks,  Mark 
 The report of my absence is premature - I will be in our South American offices Mon. - Thurs. of next week but am in the office in Houston all of this week.  I am also not aware of any memoranda on point.  I have seen the issue addressed in an off-hand way in one or more articles (not really legal analysis) and will keep my eyes open for those.  The bottom line is usually that insurance requires an actual loss and proof of that loss before a claim can be made on the insurance while in the case of the derivative, no loss needs to be shown, only the actual weather conditions described in the agreement.  Mark 
 Robert:  Actually, I will be out of the office Mon - Wed of next week.  Tana is expecting you and will be able to get you started on the swap training program.  You will probably need to give her name at the receptionist in the lobby - her extension is x33399.  If she isn't around, Jan Dobernecker (x33427) will at least be able to get you in the building.  Your office will be EB3847 and your phone number will be (713)853-6121.  Have a good flight!  Mark 
 Note Chicago - Hong Kong rtn for $475. 
 Nony:  I will be participating, possibly with Brent Hendry (Brent - are you available?), from Buenos Aires.  Will we need to set up a conference call so that both London and B.A. can be connected?  It's also possible that Martin will be back in Oslo by then.  I'm not sure what his plans are re participating.  Regarding the agenda, I would appreciate an update from someone on the internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, I'm wondering if there are enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe like we might face here and what research has been done to date in that area.  Since at least one of us will be on the line from Argentina, we might do a quick update on some of the significant problems we are having with the regulators there.  Mark 
 Marc,  According to Houston Sidewalk the game starts at 7:30 p.m.  Why don't we pick you up just before 7:00.  Let me know if that's a problem.  Mark 
 Michelle is going to discuss this with Sharon Butcher (an outside labor lawyer we use).  Apparently there is some corporate policy against indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here due to the nature of Argentine law in the area.   We'll keep you posted. 
 Marc,  The game starts at 7:30.  Why don't we stop by to pick you up at a little before 7:00.  Let me know if this presents any problems.  Mark 
 FYI 
 Carolina,  I have finally received my tickets.  I will arrive at Ezeiza on United Airlines flight #761 on Sunday, March 14 at 11:15 a.m.  Can you arrange to have a driver meet me at the airport?  I will be staying at the Sheraton. Thank you very much for your help.  Mark 
 I tried dialing 8-9-0-0- and 8-9-0 right after we finished talking and neither one works.  We'll have to keep hoping. 
 Thanks for your help - is Scott is in Houston today?  Maybe I could meet with him here.  Any chance he will be back in BA by Tuesday? (I am scheduled to leave Tuesday night.) 
 1. Jason Rose 2. Jason appeared intelligent and poised.  He was well prepared for his interview. 3. While Jason has some legal-related experience, I wonder if a second year student might not be a better catch for us.  If we don't have that as an option, I think Jason would be fine. 
 Thanks Nony - sounds good to me. 
 Here's the agreement with my changes (I think they show up in blue).  I changed the "permit' language and one date. 
 Justin -  How do we participate in the CEPI?  Are we providing prices to them?  Mark 
 FYI - I found this on the internet today:   =ABB: Power Derivatives Trading In Germany Still Long Way Off  [Dow Jones News Service via DowVision ? Rcvd: Mar 18, 05:51 AM ]    By Axel Revheim  OSLO (Dow Jones)--Derivatives trading in the German electricity market won't take off until certain structural blocks in the power industry are cleared, paving the way for a spot market to develop as a first step, Jonas Kollberg, head of ABB Financial Energy told Dow Jones this week.  ABB Financial Energy is a division of Swiss-Swedish engineering and construction conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. (ABBBY).  A small number of large, vertically integrated German electricity companies are effectively hindering the development of free trade - presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of electricity and controlling the means of transmission, or grids.  Currently, if a third-party wants to transport power, it must separately negotiate access and prices for each grid - an impractical arrangement for the spot market, Kollberg said.  'The advantage of the Nordic model is that you have great liquidity for derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system price. You also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot market. I can't see how they're going to solve this in Germany. They have too many isolated (monopolized) grid areas,' Kollberg said.  Financial power contracts like futures, forwards and other derivatives are based on an underlying reference price, often an average of spot price throughout a region or country. There won't be any power derivatives trading in Germany before an acknowledged reference price is established, he said.  A Liberalized Market In Law Only  The practice among German utilities of pricing electricity transmission based on the distance traveled, is a powerful barrier to trading, Kollberg said. In the fully liberalized Norwegian power market, for example, independent producers are charged fees for access to grids based on an established point system. Producers pay the same tariff, regardless of how far the electricity is transported.  Germany's new energy law, in effect since April 1998, paves the way for all German consumers to choose who supplies them with electricity. However, without clear, published grid access tariffs or a national reference price, few customers have, in reality, been able to move away from their regional supplier.  No decision has been made yet as to how Germany will organize its spot market for electricity sales. The first German electricity bourse is likely to be set up in either Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg or Leipzig. But interested parties such as the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be in place before futures trading can be introduced.  Nord Pool, the joint Swedish-Norwegian power exchange, recently joined up with Germany's Landesbank Sachsen Girozentrale, the Leipzig town authority and the Saxony state government to establish a power exchange in Leipzig.  Using expertise gained in the Nordic market, Kjetil Knutsen at Nord Pool Consulting told Dow Jones that the plan is to develop a spot market in Germany along the lines of the Nordic model.  There will be one system price for the whole of Germany, based on spot prices in the seven regions which are controlled by Germany's 'Verbund' regional transmission companies, he said.  'One can solve the spot price problem,' he said. The question isn't whether Germany will have a functioning spot market, but rather when, he said.  Separation Of Producers, Grids The Key  Even if Germany eventually establishes a reference price, the problem of vertical integration remains. One needs unbundling (between producers and grids) to open the way for competition, ABB's Kollberg said.  According to ABB's own analysis, between 78% and 83% of German power transmission lines are owned and controlled by the big German power producers.  As long as domestic producers have such grid control, power imports and exports from Germany won't be free, said Kollberg.  Any overcapacity of French power generation could be imported to the benefit of German consumers. however, because German producers control transmission, the tendency is to shield the domestic market from competition, observers said.  French electricity imports could lower prices sharply for German end-users of electricity. According to Kollberg, there's an overcapacity of 40 terawatts of electricity in France, while Germany too has an overcapacity of 31 TW. 
 I understand that Robin Jordan has taken care of this in my absence.  If you still need anything from me, please let me know.  Mark 
 I discussed this matter with Brent yesterday and I believe the correct title for Andrea is "Attorney". 
 FYI 
 Hey Bob -  Her name is Kartini Muljadi.  I haven't done a good job of staying in touch but the last numbers I have for her are:  Phone: 62-21-525-6968 Fax: 62-21-525-5561  If those don't work, you might check with Yao who has stayed in touch with one of the other lawyers in that firm.  He has moved over to Enron International where he is responsible for their African legal affairs.  I know he is out of town (in Africa) right now and unfortunately I'm not sure if his e-mail address has changed.  His phone number is the same - maybe his secretary could put you in touch with him.  Good luck!  Mark 
 P.S. - If you do get in touch with Kartini, please send her my regards.  I'm pretty sure she still likes me in spite of the way Skadden's relationship with her ended. 
 Is this something one of your people should look at? 
 Thanks Nony - looks good to me! 
 Scott:  What would you think about the week of April 19 for Tana's visit to London?  Mark 
 What travel dates did you have in mind?  I think you said you wanted to leave NY for London on the evening of the 16th (arriving Saturday morning), but when do you want to go to NY?  Let me know & I'll give Lillie a call. 
 FYI 
 Could you guys please get in touch with Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo & send her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate documentation for this transaction.  Sara - you should probably discuss with her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this.  Brent may have some information as well.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Hey Marc - any chance you guys might like to join us on a one week sailing vacation in the Caribbean early next year (Feb or March)? 
 Anita:  I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.  My vague memory is that only financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.  Do you remember this and can you refresh my recollection?  Mark 
 That schedule sounds good to me. 
 Looks good to me. 
 The Inn at Little Washington sounds great but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it this time.  However, as the geekiest among I consider it my duty to point out that since the millennium doesn't actually end until December 31, 2000, we do have next year!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Marcus:  I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for you appears to be at some other company entirely.  Please feel free to call me once you get this note to discuss further.  The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in London.  On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.  I believe that the advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course, all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the discussion.  I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has already dealt with similar issues. 
 Oops.  Mine didn't go either.  I've now forwarded your message.  Here's Yao's new address:  Yao Apasu/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
 Looks good to me.  There is an airport in Burbank.  All the major airlines go there as well as Southwest. 
 Done 
 The alternatives are a net worth of US$1,000,000 or that all trades be guaranteed by an entity that meets the financial requirements. 
 Is this for you? 
 Mark:  One issue to keep in mind regarding membership in this exchange:  if there is no clearing house and the exchange is the counterparty to all transactions, who bears the liability when a third party defaults?  We certainly need to know if it is the exchange membership.  If not, how is the liability limited and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade?  Mark 
 Justin:  The mention of Statoil made me think of Norway.  Alliance doesn't sound like a Norwegian entity so it's probably not an issue here, but do you think we should discourage large volume and long term multiple trades with Norwegian entities given our continuing uncertainty over netting there?  Mark 
 Marcus -  Here is the note I sent on 3/31.  David Mitchell is definitely the right guy.  Mark 
 I have asked Russell to add you both to his distribution list. 
 Attached is a first draft of a statement of our policy concerning the termination of trading contracts on the bankruptcy of a counterparty.  Please give me the benefit of your comments and I will produce a further draft for Mark's review. 
 Buck:  Here's my list of things to do on the boat.  Let me know what you think we= =20 should work on first.  On Deck: Winch maintenance (someday I=01,d like to install a self tailing halyard w= inch) Inspect rig, adjust tension Some system needed to prevent jib sheets chafing on shrouds Check jib sheet cars Brightwork refinishing Cockpit drains should be checked for adequate flow - particularly those under the engine hatch Spreader boot needs to be reinstalled on starboard spreader Windex needs to be straightened/tightened  Electronics: VHF - check Depth Sounder - not reading consistently, odd read-out Wind Speed indicator - not registering Knot Meter - paddle wheel needs to be installed Loran - operating properly? Engine gauges - check ammeter, tach  Fresh Water System: Galley faucet not working (and sink drains very slowly) System should be disinfected Broken hose under sink in head  Check leaks around ports, probably rebed ports  Interior teak oiled  Stereo: Only working on one channel Install CD player 
 Sorry for the delay in getting this back to you.  Give me a call and we can discuss in more detail.  Mark  P.S. - have you been watching the Horatio Hornblower movies on A&E?    Christian Yoder 
 Scott:  I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these CFTC  issues.  I'll let you know how it goes.  I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in Houston.  I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.  Mark 
 Sorry about the previous message (re: bankruptcy legislation).  Please ignore. 
 Heather:  Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:  Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are: a. banks; b. non-bank financial institutions ("NBFI"); and c. foreign invested enterprises ("FIE").  Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned enterprises ("WFOE"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures ("SFJV") and include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.  I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd be happy to send a copy on. 
 I put a call in to Cadwalader this afternoon to see if they had someone following these bills in DC........great minds! 
 Martin:  Mark H. has asked me to participate in another conference call scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Houston time tomorrow which will almost certainly last at least an hour and possibly more.  If you think 30 minutes will be enough, I wonder if we could reschedule our call for 8:30 (3:30 your time)? 
 As discussed. 
 Thank you both for the very quick turn-around.   Yes, I agree and hope that OM will consent to the proposed changes.  Mark T. 
 It worked!  Looking forwad to seeing you later this week.  Mark 
 Becky - I will be out of town on Thurs.  I may be able to participate from NY but my schedule is still up in the air.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 It has worked fine for me so far.  I would prefer to continue to receive them by e-mail rather than have to go to the Intranet to get them.  Mark T. 
 Larry:  I'm not sure if you are the keeper of the Contact List, but since I received it from you I thought I should point out a couple of errors in the info. relative to me:  my fax number is 713-646-3490 my email address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com  Thanks  Mark 
 Looks good to me.  Mark 
 Taffy - would you please add these meetings to my calendar.  Thanks  Mark 
 Congratulations and well done to you and all the others who have worked on getting this agreement in place!  I know this was a long and difficult battle.  Mark 
 Hey Jeff:  I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.  I didn't realized you were at Mayer Brown.  I don't even know if we've talked since I left New York (almost 5 years ago).  I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital & Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal issues in derivatives trading here.  I don't get to Chicago often but if they ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!  C., F. & S.,  Mark 
 Dorice,  I was not expecting a letter from Crawford Bayley but I have dealt with them in the past so I suppose it is possible that the letter is intended for me. I have no objection to your opening the letter to determine its contents. You might wan t to wait a few days for the other Mark Taylor's reaction.  Mark 
 Dorice,  Please fax the bill to me at 713-646-3490 and just put the original in the regular interoffice mail.  My RC is 1157  Thanks for your help.  Mark 
 Hey Marc - I was in New Orleans last week, NYC & DC the week before.  Now back home & ready to relax a bit.  Hope you guys came through the storm ok this morning.  Our cars are stuck in the garage because the alley is filled with downed tree branches.  I'm not even sure who to call to get it cleared out.  Ted got a ride from a friend and I took a cab.  Let's get together soon!  Mark 
 No trouble in N.O.  I was there for a conference with all 300 Enron lawyers & paralegals from all around the world - it didn't seem prudent to go looking for trouble with all those Company folks wandering around the Quarter!  I just came on home Friday evening & went to bed.  T. said you looked like you were having fun Friday night but didn't stay out late enough to find out how much fun..... 
 FYI 
 Torrey:  I am the lawyer in ECT legal responsible for our relationship with the NYMEX and monitoring our compliance with NYMEX position limits.  Phillipe Travis tells me you may be able to help him in preparing the reports of our positions with the option delta factored in.  Thanks very much for your assistance.  Mark 
 Wow - that is one nasty looking storm out there - I wish I'd gotten in early enough to get a covered parking spot.  Oh well, may sufficient hail storm damage will get me a new car!  How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?  I have a couple of meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when you're ready to leave for the day?  Just let me know.  Call if you want - 713-853-7459.  Mark 
 I know you are getting the legal bills paid through Don's budget for work done in Argentina.  Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in Brazil the same way?  I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.  Since it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these things.  Any thoughts? 
 Mark:  I am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using a VAR-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years ago failed (Bob Williams and I worked on that project).  Many of the risks that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were close to meaningless.  If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii) the widespread use of multiple "Omnibus" short-form contracts for trades before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).  Item (i) could be fixed with legislation (as it has in New York).  Item (ii) could be reduced if the traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign master agreements.  I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side in the contract negotiation/formation process.  That buy-in needs to be at all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from the top.  Mark T. 
 I will probably go straight to the game from here so won't leave til 6:30 or 7:00.  Why don't you give me a call this afternoon - say around 3:00 or 3:30 & we can get together. 
 713-853-7459 
 Looks good to me.  Taffy, please add this to the calendar. 
 Tom:  I saw this on the Internet today:    ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS INTRODUCES ON-LINE TRADING OF BANDWIDTH DERIVATIVES BUSINESS EDITORS/TECHNOLOGY WRITERS SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MAY 11, 1999--ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS, INC., THE WORLD'S [Business Wire ? Rcvd: May 11, 08:08 AM EDT ]    BW0167 MAY 11,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN  ( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line Trading of Bandwidth Derivatives  Business Editors/Technology Writers  SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 1999--Arbinet Communications, Inc., the world's leading trading network for telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and options in telecommunications bandwidth later this month.  Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's access-controlled website where buyers and sellers can post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening process for credit, documentation and interoperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference, Booth No. 1004.  As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled derivative product that will allow anonymous web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs. Implementation of this product is an extension of Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM)).  Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure to future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level playing field where even small operators can realize the pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellers can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future.  Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as submarine cable operators. Buyers can be natural consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers) or speculators.  "Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the bandwidth market," said U. Kanad Chakrabarti, vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. "As a non-proprietary player, we can offer impartial execution for our clients, which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this."  All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site, www.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999. The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellers to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but currently not fully priced by telecommunications players.  "We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading company," said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and founder, Arbinet. "Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which gives us complete objectivity in trade execution.  "This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom minutes on behalf of international and multinational telecommunications carriers."  For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com.  Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange and switch-based clearing network for global telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for international carriers in 1998, which it estimates represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year. The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies including Internet Telephony Service Providers and major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong.

 Sorry for the delay.  Here is a revised version of the certificate.  My proposed changes should show up marked when you open it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mark 
 Suzanne:  Please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ECT Legal Dept. asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you know their t-shirt sizes.   Once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes, please give the list to Dan.  Thanks,  Mark 
 I think we are doing Hawaiian shirts - we just don't want everyone to know yet.  Yes - please include all the offices - also include Singapore & Buenos Aires.  Tana will let you know which people in the London office will be coming. 
 Mark -  I think you are right - this is no doubt the best we can do.  Let's go ahead and take care of execution.  Thanks very much for all your help.  Mark 
 Let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.  The guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why they're signing it.  Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?  I'm taking a few people to dinner & you might enjoy it.  Mark 
 What documents do we use for these deals?  Is it the German translation of our Industrial Master?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Scott:  It's great to see a senior commercial person take an interest in our issues! Any chance this can be videotaped so we can see it here?  Mark T. 
 I found this on our intranet site: 
 Just a note to let you know I will have to miss our meeting on Tuesday - I will not be back from New York until around noon. 
 Any chance you can think abot this a bit for our Monday meeting? 
 FYI 
 Janice:  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you - Elizabeth is now working in the power trading area and Sara has been out of town.  I agree with you that the letter seems harmless enough and I wouldn't blame the commercial folks for being upset if it looks like GS is trying to do and end-around on the process.  Yes - let's send it and get an opportunity to participate in offering the products.  Mark 
 Any seats left for the sushi demo?  If so, I'd like to attend. 
 Looks good to me. 
 Hey Buck -  How've you been?  I assume business has been good since I haven't heard from you lately.  Don't forget to send me a bill  for the work you did on the boat last month......  Mark 
 Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first of the year.   A month or two ago Mark H. mentioned that there might be an ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to schedule something around then.  I believe that's around the 28th.  Let's try to set up dinner again!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Ken:  I thought you might be interested in the attachment.  Mark 
 Those should be paid like his regular expenses.  Please let me know if someone raises an objection.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 No problem. 
 Yes, I think that's how it's supposed to be.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I approved an access request for this that came through yesterday.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 FYI: One of our legal consultants has mentioned that another of his clients is setting up an internet derivatives trading system.  They are using an outfit called Intuitive Products International based in New York and London to assist with system design.  Tana Jones (x33399) will be setting up a demo by these folks with our legal department needs in mind - if you'd like to attend, we'd be happy to have you and ask them to expand their presentation to include internet trading. 
 I'm looking for an article that appeared on page 12 of the May 17 issue of Investment Dealers' Digest entitled "CFTC contacts Blackbird, which reignites debate." Mark Taylor 413/1157 
 Does the proposed reorg now contemplate that a US entity will act as principal for financial transactions? 
 Christian,  I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the Armada.  The "Spanish Armada" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.  The Armada was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the English Channel.  Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.  Of course, the English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and you'd have to say "on" in the early 1800's  when Nelson "broke the enemy line" at the battle of Trafalgar.  I believe that was during a time when the Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.  The battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.  I'm pretty sure it's somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish. Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?  The English victory has in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.  As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always referred to as the "trading policy" but is officially referred to as the "Risk Management Policy."  It most definitely covers Portland trading operations.  I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.  Ted Murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.  I don't have a current version but will ask Ted for one.  Mark    Christian Yoder 
 FYI:  Alex Mashinsky of ARBINET will be speaking on "Commoditising Telecoms: The Development of a Spot Market for International Telecoms Trading" at Risk99 in Boston June 8 & 9. 
 Cynthia:  As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent Congress.  I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed revisions.  We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the outcome this time around.  Are you the right person in your shop for us to talk to about this?  If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks,  Mark 
 I will be in New York on June 17 & 18. 
 Regarding Louise's second paragraph, I guess I had always assumed there would be different governing law provisions at a minimum - and dispute resolution fits similarly - with parties in various jurisdictions.  Any thoughts? 
 Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in them would apply to on-line trades.  The availability of the on-line system may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed. 
 I have not yet had a chance to read this but thought I should pass it along asap. 
 Here is another services agreement - this one used as a form by EES. 
 I have not yet had a chance to read this but thought I should pass it along asap. 
 Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook  FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are ``poised on the precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next, according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.  ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications:  Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak capacity requirements. Because demand growth is outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years. Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive year of above-average hydroelectric generation -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in 1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, the West will find itself at an even greater risk of price spikes. Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 2000, the result of both higher regional spot natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the value of ensuring reliability for consumers.  The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and highlights the following key results:  Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand growth is strong, creating a long-term regional capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region. Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices is for negative real growth through 2010, but the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is slowly added over the next few years. Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue to rise (but still remain below many other regions) as new, more efficient generation is added. Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by 2010, with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if any, real price appreciation through 2010.  ``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the other five regional volumes, offers comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from working one- on-one with the market's key players.''  About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook  ICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, an authoritative assessment of North American regional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respected consulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project due diligence evaluations for the North American electric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is available for six regional markets -- West, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada -- well as a National Subscription, which includes the six regional studies and a North American summary volume. Additional information on the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, including a prospectus, sample volume, and order form, can be found at http://www.icfkaiser.com/consulting/products/BPS.htm.

 Justin,  I note that the ETA has been revised to include a paragraph which provides that Enron's electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation.  Is that how we want this to work?  In the telephone trading context we assume that the executed confirmation will control over the oral conversation, even when we have a recording of the conversation.  Mark 
 Sorry - I'll be in NYC that weekend and I believe that's T's big swim meet in Atlanta.  But thanks for the offer! 
 I'm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or not - can't wait to hear the details  Yes, it was a fun weekend - we were in Austin.  T. swimming at the Lake and I stayed around the hotel using the gym and getting a massage.  Good food, too.  The only downer was the drive. 
 Darlene:  I'm busy on Thursday but Friday looks good.  Mark 
 Our meeting for this morning will have to be canceled due to scheduling conflicts.  Please make every effort to reserve this time slot (first and third Wednesdays at 10:00) in the future for our group meetings. 
 Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms - including the Omnibus Annex A.  Please give some thought to whether there are any other revisions we should make at this time.  We make every effort to minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many necessary changes made at this time as possible.  Mark 
 I currently have a 28800 modem but would like to get the fastest (within reason) modem we have available for a Compaq LTE 5280.  Please let me know if this is the kind of thing I can get by Friday since I leave for London Friday afternoon and would like to take the computer (complete with modem) with me. If the new modem is not available in that time frame, I at least need a new pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken.  Thanks and please charge 413/1157.  Mark Taylor x37459 
 The current versions are all the way at the bottom. 
 Here is the current version.  The numbers on the Annex have been deleted. 
 Hey Tim -  Thanks for the note - I needed a smile today.  I've been extremely busy and am leaving this afternoon for another trip to our London office.  Were you able to make any headway with the Bank regarding the NY house?  I just wondered if Greg had been able to help at all.  Mark 
 One more try...... 
 One more try...... 
 Hi Marc -  I just got back from London last night.  Looks like our IT people found out about this yesterday too - don't know if it hit us or not but they made everybody log off & back on again during the day yesterday - I'm assuming that was to install a new virus shield.  Didn't affect me since I wasn't here anyway.  How've you been?  MT 
 Does this make sense to you? 
 Has Louise mentioned anything about this to you?  What are we supposed to do with it? 
 We're home this weekend - might go sailing (you're welcome to come if you want) but nothing big planned.  I'm in NYC next Wed - Sun., T's in a swim meet in Atlanta next weekend, NYC after that.  Nothing planned for the 26/27 weekend & still toying with the idea of Seattle for the 4th. 
 Here's a very rough draft of a set of slides we might use.  Let me know if this is even close to what you have in mind.  I can have one of our paralegals and our graphics dept. fill in whatever we need and make it look good tomorrow.  Mark 
 Attached is the form of schedule to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement we use for purely financial transactions - swaps and options.  There are a large number of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and negotiating from here.  To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.  I'm not sure they will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I suspect you need.  If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.  When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from commodity to commodity.  I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms. In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).  If your situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic changes to these forms might be in order.  With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent that they don't even use forms as such.  I will ask Julia Murray to contact you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk about those types of transactions.  Unfortunately, I don't know of an electronic table of contents to the forms.  There is a project underway to create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought.      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.  If not, would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?

 I've been working the whole time - no vacation or sick time to report. 
 Here's a revised draft. 
 Alison:  Kevin & I are putting the final touches on our presentation - will we be able to have a projector for a computer/powerpoint presentation?  Mark 
 Yes, we would like to use the PowerPoint presentation.  Sorry for the last minute request.  If it's a big problem, I might be able to get our graphics dept. to turn it into 35mm slides.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I think this has already been sent to you.  Just wondering, though, why this is being lumped together in one complex transaction instead of splitting it into two. 
 Both of those times work for me. 
 I have my Wine Country book here at the office today but don't know where to send it - if you're in Houston I can have a messenger bring it to you.  Mark 
 Here are the powerpoint slides for our presentation tomorrow.  Kevin should be sending you some additional pages that are not part of the slides but that we would like to hand out.  See you tomorrow!  Mark 
 Louise - I'm already booked for Friday morning (including a 10:30 at S&C) - hopefully I can get a download from Justin & Scott on Monday.     Invitation Chairperson: Louise Kitchen  Start: 06/18/99 08:30 AM End: 06/18/99 10:00 AM  Description: Meeting to discuss CC's Foreign Jurisdiction Report - London 2:30 / New York 9:30    This meeting repeats   starting on    (if the date occurs on a weekend the meeting ). Meeting Dates:    Justin Boyd/LON/ECT Scott Sefton/LON/ECT Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT  Detailed description: 
 Sylvia:  I have been unable to reach either Jeff Keeler or Maureen McVicker to talk about this today.  I'm a little worried about who is handling the Commissioner's itinerary at this point and I don't know if anyone has reserved a conference room for the 2:30 meeting.  Fred Lagrasta is now also supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know if he needs any audio/visual equipment).  Can you check on this - maybe somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office will know where this is supposed to take place?  It is entirely possible that no one has reserved a room yet.  If you could do that and then let the attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.  Unfortunately, I'm on my way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself.  Thanks for your help!  Mark T. 
 Jeff:  In preparation for his meetings with Commissioner Newsome and Congressman Stenholm, Mark H. has asked for  information including a bullet point list of our key issues and any appropriate background material.  I have prepared a draft issues list which is attached.  Would you please take a quick look at it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it on to Mark?  He probably also needs the final itineraries.  Thanks for your help.  Mark T. 
 I hope ours looks better than this:  http://www.unioncal.com/ 
 sorry about that - misdirected to you. 
 could you please look into this? 
 I have revised the relevant experience paragraph slightly (if you open the attachment using "Launch" you can see the changes highlighted).  Kim, if this is OK with you please go ahead and use it. 
 I can certainly be available for a portion of that time - can you tell me the purpose of the call? 
 Hi Debbie:  Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!  I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy company (Enron).  I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce which is relatively new.  The most fun work project I've had was being the lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading platform about a year ago.  It has been tremendously successful.  While few people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in the world!  I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international mutual funds in New York.  My work takes me there several times a year and I usually try to see him if I have some free time.  The college is thinking about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).  Ralph V. was there - whom I hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.  I was on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.  There were only 2 of us from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see familiar faculty faces.  With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.  My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a terrible commute.  I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.  I rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me know if you ever make it down this way.  Mark 
 Sure - it's not secret.    Tana Jones 12/12/2000 09:12 AM 
 Generally speaking we have only documented that kind of concern when there were separate legal entities involved (like getting a comfort letter or guaranty from EI when ECT had to do the swap for one of their deals).  I think we can get away with pointing out the issue to both commercial sides.    Mary Cook 12/14/2000 03:30 PM 
 Did you get this? 
 Peter -  Should Tana add you to her list of people who get the daily EnronOnline customer list?  She sends it out to several lawyers to see if there is any reason not to give access to the system.  Mark    Peter Keohane Sent by: Sharon Crawford 12/14/2000 11:09 AM 
 Thanks for the e-mail - I tried to go in and update my info but the system is down and will be down all weekend.  Is Monday early enough? 
 Thanks for the number.  I did not get the cooking set for Elena - I ordered the bongo drum. 
 I spoke with Justin briefly this morning - he wants to look into this and get back to me.    Lisa Lees 12/19/2000 05:38 PM 
 Thanks! 
 Thanks - I've asked Sara to give him a call now, too.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 12/20/2000 11:51 AM 
 I am on Continental Express Flight 4100 from Houston to Cincinnati Depart: Houston (IAH), 23-Dec-00 at 11:00 AM Arrive: Cincinnati (CVG), 23-Dec-00 at  2:26 PM  My flight on Tuesday is the same as at Thanksgiving: leaving Cincinnati at 3:00.  If picking me up is a problem, just let me know and I can try to rent a car. 
 I'll be in Cincinnati, OH and then traveling back to Houston on Tues.  You can reach me at (513)541-8649 or on my cell phone (713)206-8080. 
 My understanding is that the transportation and shipping business is all=20 being done physically right now.  Our plan was to get Cheryl involved with= =20 the derivatives contracts first.  Since there is so much more written about= =20 them and more of an industry consensus as to what they should look like, we= =20 thought it would be easier for her to learn the ropes in this area. =20 
 Denis:  Try Deb Korkmas at 713-853-5448.  Happy Holidays!  Mark    Denis O'Connell 12/27/2000 06:18 AM 
 Thanks Mark.  I think this one went to a whole lot of people - I can't tell if it was on purpose or a mistake! 
 Is there a retail location in Houston, TX where I can find an AF3.0HD?  Thanks,  Mark Taylor (713)853-7459 (office) (713)863-7190 (home) (713)646-3490 (fax) 
 Yes, I think we were ok with the base language - it was just those last issues we were waiting on.    Greg Johnston 01/02/2001 03:34 PM 
 Why don't you come in Saturday night & I'll take you to dinner? 
 I did get Janet the white top (Interlock turtleneck - Medium, color - white #A32027)  from Talbots.  It was the fleece vest that they didn't have in the stores.  I did not get the towels.  Glad the computer is working better for you.  It makes all the difference in the world to have it speed up.  For me it actually becomes more useful since I cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to happen.  My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.  I wonder if people grow them outdoors when the weather warms up.  The smell might work better with more room to disperse.  This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I can stand it!  Love,  Mark 
 I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange Act issues. 
 That's fine.  We don't keep particularly careful track of these things but pretty much estimate the percentages on a quarterly basis.    Francisco Pinto Leite@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/03/2001 04:13 PM 
 Just so you can see what is happening..... 
 Looks good to me.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 01/04/2001 08:31 AM 
 Do you know if Enron is trying to have any input in the selection process?    Chris Long@ENRON 01/04/2001 09:38 AM 
 I think this will do for now.  Thanks    Becky Spencer 01/04/2001 10:01 AM 
 Sounds good to me.    Tanya Rohauer 01/04/2001 03:35 PM 
 Elizabeth Sager, who is responsible for power trading documentation in North America and was in large part responsible for drafting the Industrial Master several years ago, is reviewing the proposed form.  She will have comments for us by Monday morning, Houston time. 
 I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!  I don't remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket.  Bummer - looks like I'll just have to be the wimp this time.  There's really no way I can get away next week.  I have heard of las ventanas - but I didn't know about the evian spritzing.  Maybe next time.  Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?  I could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister...... 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of the office construction process will begin in just over a week.  That means it is finally time to move into your new offices.  Taffy Milligan will be submitting the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move. 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of the office construction project will begin in a little over a week.  There is good news and bad news.  First the bad: the office which you currently occupy will be in the next construction phase.    Now the good:  it looks like we will probably have a place for you to sit until your new office is ready. Taffy Milligan will submit the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move. 
 That's a great idea - I'll see if I can line up a boat - anywhere in particular you'd like to sail?  (BVI makes sense if there's a newcomer along.)  Where do you fly into to get to Charlottesville?    "Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com> 01/04/2001 07:20 PM 
 I'll definitely take the room.  How (and when) do you plan to get there?  Do you rent a car in DC and drive or fly into Charlottesville?    "Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com> 01/05/2001 10:15 AM 
 Approved. 
 We can try - an we'll ask the planners to put that in the design.  But Mark H. has indicated a desire to get rid of as many of the tall walls as possible and he approves all of the construction requests personally, so we may not succeed.    Suzanne Adams 01/05/2001 12:10 PM 
 Approved. 
 As per our telephone call. 
 You might find the attached of interest.  I fear it is time to consider the S&C memorandum we discussed at our first meeting in New York. 
 Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit?    Russell Diamond 01/05/2001 05:20 PM 
 Seems to me that L/C's are the way to go then, rather than asking for cash or another asset as collateral.  (Another option would be to mix and match - taking cash up to $10 mil. and L/C's beyond that.)   Lenders frequently set up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control over how much "debt" is supported by the asset base while still giving the borrower some flexibility.  As you can imagine, most other extenders of credit are willing to take the bank's L/C in lieu of a lien on a hard asset.    Russell Diamond 01/08/2001 06:42 PM 
 Yes, I'm looking forward to it.    RAISLERK@sullcrom.com 01/09/2001 09:52 AM

 Nora - I got your voice mail & will try to call you soon - I'm stuck on a conference call.  I tend to agree with you - this seems to me to be contrary to our policy.  On the other hand, it also sounds like a request we would want to make if we were on the other side.    Nora Dobin@ENRON 01/11/2001 10:06 AM 
 Sorry Andrea - I just tried to open this and it turns out to be the Spanish version.    Andrea Calo@ENRON 01/11/2001 01:53 PM 
 Thanks for the update - the fax came in and was delivered to Jeff Hodge by mistake - I'll leave it at your desk.    Holly Keiser@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/12/2001 04:53 PM 
 There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the internet trading language in the confirm they generate? 
 Here are some early drafts I worked on. 
 Re: assistant searches, I think you would be well advised to coordinate closely with Janette Elbertson. 
 I have a conflict with the Friday morning call this week.  Any chance you will be covering it?  I know you guys are busy this week..... 
 I'll let you know when I figure out what our Firm ID and Password are. 
 I just heard that there is a farewell party for Rainer on Friday afternoon - don't know any details. 
 Ohmygawd!  An e-mail message from Hal!  Now I know we really ARE in the 21st century.  I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and don't need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.  Ted will get there Friday eve.  I have meetings during the days Thursday & Friday and Sat. morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.  Otherwise I don't think we have specific plans.  Looking forward to it!  Mark 
 Sounds good to me - let's say dinner on Thursday and then either lunch or dinner - your choice - including Ted on Saturday.  We have no plans at all so far so we're flexible.  Mark 
 Tana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation after it is executed.  There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a patch-work of policies created by the operating units.  Tana and I would be happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind. 
 I see what you mean - the GTC's get attached to the confirms when they are sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are different. 
 Linda said she had an extra room booked - do I need to call the hotel directly or work through Linda?    "Andrea Williams" <AWILLIAM@skadden.com> 01/18/2001 05:50 PM 
 Peter  Welcome to Enron!  I usually get to the London office a couple of times a year and will look forward to meeting you there.  If not, hopefully we'll see you at the Law Conference in the Spring.  Most of your e-mail is well outside my area of expertise.  Are you consulting me regarding the regulatory issues and section 10.2?  If so, it would help if you told me what 10.2 says.....  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss.  Mark    Peter Traung@ENRON 01/18/2001 01:51 PM 
 Hey Jim,  Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.  Let us know when you find a place to live  Mark 
 try userid EOL67313 password WELCOME! 
 Hal  I hope you have access to e-mail in KW.  I'm down with the flu so we won't be able to make it.  I was really looking forward to this for a number of reasons - including the chance to get together with you.  I didn't have your phone number or e-mail address at home so I had a friend drop my work computer off on his way home tonight.  I've left a message for Don at home - sorry about late notice.  Mark 
 shouldn't the people who need filing cabinets order them for themselves?    Taffy Milligan 01/18/2001 09:37 AM 
 You are set to move as soon as the current construction phase is completed - we hope that will be by March 1. 
 In case you need to know.... 
 I may have missed it, but a VERY quick look at CNN's site showed no reports of computer virus activity since November.    "Taylor, Timothy G Mr HJF" <Timothy.Taylor@APG.AMEDD.ARMY.MIL> 01/26/2001 03:42 PM 
 Very good question - while you don't need to worry about otc swaps, otc options might be a problem.  However, if the customer is not a US entity, the advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there would be a problem. 
 Not sure why you weren't on this distribution.... 
 Can you follow up with Anthony Dayao? 
 I should be down for sick time for Mon. through Thurs. last week.    Holly Keiser@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/29/2001 07:46 AM 
 Works for me.    Lisa Yoho@ENRON 01/29/2001 01:32 PM 
 In case the Four Seasons doesn't work out, there are two other hotels downtown you might consider:  The Stephen F. Austin (an Intercontinental I think) and the Driskill.  Both are old (by U.S. standards) hotels that have been updated.  For several years after its renovation the Driskill was the nicest place in town - then came the Four Seasons.  The Stephen F. Austin was just completely redone a year or so ago - I haven't been inside but I hear they did a nice job.  Both are primarily business hotels so they may have good weekend rates. 
 Sounds good to me.    Lisa Yoho@ENRON 01/29/2001 02:31 PM 
 Still available?    Janette Elbertson 01/30/2001 09:11 AM 
 FYI 
 Looks good to me! 
 FYI 
 I'm very flexible on who comes along - no views at all on that score.  It would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so we can book the correct size boat.  You can always change the amount of groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved.  I called Keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra room - it looks great from the website.  Will you be golfing or should we make massage appointments?  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure which days we have reserved - another alternative might be to stay near DC on the day we get back from sailing (Inn at Little Washington?).  My guess is it's an all day affair getting from a little island to DC so we may get in pretty late.  Tell Amanda I said Hi! 
 Very funny - although I have to say I thought yours was the least humorous of the bunch.
