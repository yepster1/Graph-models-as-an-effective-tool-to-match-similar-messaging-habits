kruptcy is our other option.  The working environment is not good. The firm needs to lay off people now, as opposed to dragging it out.  I think the good groups will be sold off to the highest bidders, or competitors just buy up all our talented people when the company under.  Any news about your job offer?  Are you looking again?  Mike 
 Ok, let me know if you got an extra ticket. 
 Sara will be responding from Enron.  She is conferring with the traders this morning. 
 Kerry,  Did everything go ok today?  Also, I cannot get into my hotmail.  Can you forward me any e-mails.  Thanks  I LOVE YOU  MIKE

 In 5 minutes, I already tried twice. 
  Can you forward my e-mail?  LOVE YOU!  Mike 
 If you haven't heard back in an hour or so, you may have to print it out and go down and shove it under their noses.  Tana can show you where they sit if you don't already know. 
 I think Sara Shackleton was the last Enron lawyer to have worked on this. 
 Since this is for someone in the Governor's office, I have no objection.  I think we need to be careful when regulators who might have an interest in regulating the system are asking. 
 I was working in the NY office on 9/4 and here in the London office since 9/10. 
 I am stranded in London - there are worse places these days - but hope to get back tomorrow (Sunday).  Glad you are well. 
 I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home. 
 After a two and a half hour delay -- mostly caused by the extra security -- we finally got off the ground yesterday and I am now back in Houston.  I talked to Amanda after I checked in and she said you were on the train to the airport.  Did you have any trouble?

We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home. 
 I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.  In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.  From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.  Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.  Good luck!  Mark 
 Sounds like a plan to me.  Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.  You might try these:  In Sedona: Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)  In Scottsdale/Phoenix: Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews) The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool) The Boulders (also highly rated)  At the Canyon El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)  In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon): The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon 
 Looks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d). 
 If you have not already done so this week, please remember to update your work reports for me this afternoon.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I'll be on the call.

 Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the Atlantic.  I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I think that's why they can't dock in ny.  Has Amanda made it back yet? 
 What about Noble?  Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet? 
 Example 1  Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a "Loss" to Party A from the termination) Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a "Gain" to Party B from the termination) There are no Unpaid Amounts  The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99 Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss)    Example 2  Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts  The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39 Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain)   Let me know if you need any further explanation.

 While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue. 
 Go for it. 
 Hopefully just a nuisance. 
 See you there. 
 Looks OK to me. 
 The first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to Gas Daily.  I have trouble with the second one.  This really looks like a basis swap so I think we need to start with basis swap language.  Can you call me on this one? 
 Sounds good to me.

 Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis f= rom a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the tra= nsactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake tr= ades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is n= ot blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We h= ave been handling these by using a written termination rather than a revers= e trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders h= ave agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by= mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the c= onfirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you= a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out o= f a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake = is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is= mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the o= riginal trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alter= native we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's= "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I= know, we have only had to do this once or twice.

 Wish we could go - but we're off to Ft. Lauderdale this evening.  Are you in town next weekend?  If not, let's try for something on a weeknight. 
 Congrats Justin!  Good job!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Jan - can you please take care of scheduling this. 
 I have asked the tax guys to talk to you directly since I am in South America this week.  If you have not heard from them, you might try calling Stephen Douglas or Jeff Blumenthal.  They are the tax experts for EnronOnline. 
 Thanks for your note.  My company has revised our e-mail addresses.  Please change my address in your records to Mark.Taylor@enron.com.  Thanks! 
 I have no objection to changing the product name.  The tax issue concerns the location of the trader - if the guy managing the prices is in London but the transactions are with ENA, there may be tax implications.  Mark

 Any idea why this question came up? 
 I found this picture of my boat on the internet! 
 My thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of EnronOnline:  1.  The online "making of a market" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 2.  The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction. 3.  The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation of the "Stack Manager" which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person. 4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line "short description" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty. 5.  The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place. 6.  It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application) 7.  The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders. 8.  Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested. 9.  The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.

 Here's another lawyer applicant for the paralegal job - I don't remember this one either...... 
 This one I remember seeing before but I don't remember making an interview decision one way or the other. 
 Thanks Tara! 
 The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t= he=20 terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll= =20 have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. = I=20 also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is= =20 traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20 Descriptions:  Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel= y=20 clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i= n=20 the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin= e=20 something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20 Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the= =20 relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20 referring to the quality as well.  Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?  The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -= =20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the= =20 GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes= =20 more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa= me=20 units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number= =20 some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.= =20 The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit= . =20 It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20 volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20  Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20 beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to= =20 the GTC.  The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20 parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about= =20 this more than I.)  If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I= =20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha= t=20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per= =20 month'.  Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to = be=20 clear from the Long Description.   So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with= =20 something like this:  A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20 shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th= e=20 General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20 The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv= e=20 Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20 Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20 Date>. =20 The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling= =20 Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20 CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20 Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20 LSAJCAWZH04). The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20 The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit= =20 per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per= =20 month.=20   If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b= e=20 more like this:  A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of= =20 DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the= =20 Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition= s=20 will apply to this Transaction. =20 The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv= e=20 Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20 Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20 Date>. =20 The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling= =20 Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20 CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20 Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20 LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles. The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20 The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per= =20 month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont= h.=20 Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20 number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe= r of=20 Bandwidth Units.  Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve= =20 the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.  Mark 
 Thanks for your quick reply.  My apologies for asking so many questions wit= h=20 obvious answers.  I hope I didn't waist too much of your time.  I also had = a=20 chat with Dave Forster yesterday in which he set me straight on many of the= se=20 issues.  Thanks for creating all of this so fast!  Mark 
 I'm in Buenos Aires today and talked to Andrea about her computer.  While they are having big problems with her laptop (it likes to eat hard drives) she will be able to bring it along (it's a Compaq Armada 1500C - will that fit in the docking station?).  In case it isn't working, can we get her set up with one of the Windows 2000 machines that are being installed Tuesday morning?  Mark 
 I haven't been able to get into any off these things.  Do you know what they are? 
 My only comment would be to suggest that the Password Application and registration form be referred to as "available online".  Describing them as "online" forms may lead some to believe that they can be filled out and submitted online while in fact the Password Application must be printed out and signed before being sent to us.  Mark 
 Hey Amanda!  Yao just gave me your e-mail address.  He had told me you were at UVA a couple of months ago.  How do you like law school so far?  I have to admit I pretty much hated every minute of it.  Now that I think about it, I can't say that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.  Oh well, the pay is pretty good.  I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time). When are we going sailing again?  Got any good vacation weeks coming up?  The Caribbean sure sounds good right about now...... 
 I will be out of the office at a seminar on Thursday and Friday of this week. 
 I am in an all-day seminar tomorrow and Friday - I'm afraid we may have to miss this one. 
 Jason - if you have time, would you please take a look at this? 
 We are now able to open these but can't say I'm any happier about it.  Well, maybe that's too extreme - at least it seems like a good idea in principle. But I do have several questions:  Do we have a similar system here in NA? Are we expected to review all of these?  Is there some way to filter out the junk?  To whom should I address these questions? 
 Here is the Japanese repsonse which also contains our inquiry. 
 I don't think this person's experience is the right fit for our paralegal position. 
 This person doesn't have the kind of experience that we are looking for but she might work for one of the other groups in the department.  I am forwarding this to Ann-Elizabeth White who may know of an appropriate spot. 
 These do not appear in my SRRS but I would approve them if I could. 
 You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.  Can you resend so I'll have the dates?  My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.  If I can get there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine & if not I'm sure I'll find a room somewhere close by. 
 This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could. 
 This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could. 
 This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could. 
 In case you have to work late again and need a smile or two...... 
 In the future, please print these out for me instead of sending them by e-mail.  Thanks! 
 I agree that an electronic system of tracking these things is a good idea. Either the electronic or manual system will be admissable, but the electronic system strikes me as more reliable.  I'm more concerned witht he effectiveness of the notification - it's still not clear to me that adding a line on the ticker will be satisfactory.  In fact, it clearly is not satisfactory for changes in the ETA or a GTC.  Those documents will have to be clicked on again if any changes are made, the only remaining question being how do you highlight the changes.  The significant gray area is still changes to the Long Descriptions. 
 Yes, I will take care of this one. 
 Let me know if this is what you had in mind. 
 Is this for you? 
 I have revised my profile to give you calendar management access - sorry about the delay. 
 We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure about the exact schedule for the eve.  Mind if we bring a friend or two?  I doubt they'll come with us (they work til about 9 or 10 on Fridays and are usually ready to collapse at that point) but you never know til you ask.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Thanks for taking care of this!  Sorry if I caused any confusion. 
 Release Date: 05/04/00 New York Mercantile Exchange Announces E-Commerce Venture  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Nachamah Jacobovits (212) 299-2430 Maria Gonzalez (212) 299-2436 NEW YORK, NY, May 4, 2000 - The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX, an e-commerce venture that is intended to become the premier, global exchange for over-the-counter (OTC) forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts. The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture. The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management for OTC trading, and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position. eNYMEX will provide a single, internet-based interface to both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, depending on the session. The Exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in OTC markets. The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, with some spot cash market products also offered. Over time, this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals, coal, and, potentially, bandwidth, weather, and emissions. Although the initial geographic focus will be on North America, contracts are also expected to be offered for some European and Asian locations. In addition to today's launch announcement, the key milestones of eNYMEX, are expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading, followed by Internet-based order-routing for futures trading, including a common interface for OTC and futures trading, and clearing and settlement of OTC trading. Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said, "The global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that provides an open, independent, and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants, price transparency, counter-party credit risk management, and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts." Mr. Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other available OTC systems: ? Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange. ? The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with "bricks & mortar". ? The Exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse, which will be used to provide counter-party risk management ? Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets, providing significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and commodities. eNYMEX will be a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave the meeting I was in with her to call.  I tried to call you in London just now but there was no answer.  If you are still around, please feel free to try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy to set up a time that works for you.  Mark 
 The Houston desk has asked me to prepare a form of confirm for a credit derivative based on the bankruptcy of a Canadian reference entity.  Before I talk to Canadian counsel about the bankruptcy laws there I thought I should check with you guys and make sure you haven't done this already - any issues you know of? Thanks, Mark

 Would you please take care of this ASAP 
 Here is the draft of the questionnaire for local counsel.  Let me know what you think. 
 If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform (group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is checking).  If the NDA is something else, please let me know.    Louise Kitchen 05/16/2000 06:10 AM 
 Thanks for that - I had completely forgotten about the insurance issue. 
 This is why he never got it. 
 I think these will be the first days Susan Bailey gets back from being out. Please make sure this is OK with her and you guys coordinate on what's going on.    Susan Flynn 05/16/2000 11:19 AM 
 You're right - I had my weeks mixed up.  Since we are one person short I'd still appreciate it if you guys would coordinate to make sure there isn't any undue confusion. 
 Thanks Mark - these are mine and I'll ask Louise to be more careful in her addressing.    Mark A Taylor@EES 05/16/2000 03:10 PM 
 Please be careful in addressing e-mails to me - several of yours (re: Follow-up on Friday's meeting) have gone to the other MarkTaylor (Mark A Taylor).  I just found out when he forwarded them on to me. 
 PeopleFinder <peoplefinder@enron.com> 05/16/2000 09:13 PM Please respond to peoplefinder 
 It looks like we should send him the term sheet. 
 Frank -  There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault, not yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.  I am working on the Posting Agreement.  I'm afraid Louise may have thought more highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than I deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.  Travis McCullough, our corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than Thursday if his schedule permits).  I'm assuming that your legal team will have to be draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the lawyers on both sides are getting it right).  Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as we can.  Mark 
 Yes - in fact it is already on my calendar!    Andrea Bertone@ENRON 05/18/2000 09:55 AM 
 I am available - best after 6:30 or 7:00.  Where is always difficult - quieter as opposed to noisy & crowded - but not dead either (I'm not picky am I?).  Any suggestions?    "Jim Avant" <jfa@daplaw.com> 05/18/2000 02:56 PM 
 They shouldn't be doing any trading so I hope we won't need those things.    Tana Jones 05/18/2000 04:23 PM 
 What is your anticipated start date in Houston?  We need to work on a place for you to sit. 
 I got a call from AEP asking that we have Louise initial the changes we made in the CA and fax it back to them - is she here today? 
 The only other matters I know of are (i) the Thursday morning interview of Timothy Hailes for a position in the Houston Swap Group and (ii) that Mark mentioned to me that he is planning a trip up to Teeside on Wednesday.  We are trying to set up another interview on Thursday (with David Lacey) but it hasn't been finalized yet.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
