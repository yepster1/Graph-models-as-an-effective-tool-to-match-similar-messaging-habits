ifferences of opinion ... In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... All you want is for "them" to get on with it - and to leave you alone.. 
 John,  sorry for not sending it to you earlier (totally forgot to open my outlook). Raw data is on the fisrt tab of the file to the right.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Vladi. 
 Constance,  I was on vacation from October 4th to October 19th and I didn't submit my timesheet yet. I tried to do it on the HRonline web-site, but the procedure is too complicated. Is it possible that you or somebody else in the HR department mark the vacation time? I would really appreciate that.  Thank you.  Vladi Pimenov  ext. 37625

 Alejandra, there is no attachment 
 Alejandra, that's definetely shouldn't be in my book.  Great catch!!! 
 Chris,  the pipeline maps I found are worth looking at. They don't cost much ($950 for paper version and $795 for CD rom version) for both US and Canada. I think that CD-ROM version is a better bet: you can zoom in and out and you can print the parts you need. The real value is that they show every interconnect with every facility (power plants, industrials, even prisons:).  I think that it is something that would help us look into details when we approach different regions, and I think basis traders would appreciate it too.  Sample map of Montana is attached.  Vladi 
 Kimberly,  count me in
