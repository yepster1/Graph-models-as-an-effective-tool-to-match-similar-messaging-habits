 
 I passed out the Corp format last Friday at with some detail of O & M by legal entity.  I would like to have this by first thing by Monday.  Please let me know if you can't do this. 
 thanks 
 yes 
 fyi 
 I wish I could spend every day and every night with you.  You know I love you very much and I will try to be with you as much as I can.  I can't wait to see you.  Let me know what time I should meet you downstairs.  Love, Tracy 
 no problem 
 I will not attend.  Thanks 
 Is Brian available? 
 Actually, we are working with each group to see why their charges are up and we are trying to get them reduced.  We will discuss with Stan at our ETS review and do further follow up if necessary.  We actually met with Terry West and Dawn Derr last week to get their input and contacts. 
 James will send out a file with the cost elements listed shortly. 
 James will send something out shortly 
 Sure.  Let us know when they are and if any of the other EGS groups have questions maybe they can sit in? 
 Tricoast  Doug Kelting 713-461-5255 ext.16  I love you. 
 What do you think? 
 ok 
 Rod and I will be in Portland that day. 
 Is this my $10MM 
 Please take me off the list and add Jennifer Lev.  Thanks 
 We leave the Enron hanger to fly to Portland at 7:30 that morning. 
 I will not be able to make it. 
 fyi 
 I ordered the pastries.  I will bring them on Saturday.  Don't forget to make the ice cream.  I can't wait to be with you tomorrow. I love you. 
 Greg Lewis sent me the user count I will try to look at it the week of Oct 15.  They do have several Corp credits, not billing stock options and lower MMF. 
 Keith Dodson will be attending this meeting via telephone.  Please make sure he has any handouts ahead of time.  Thanks 
 Stan said last week that he would like to do a EGAS 2002 Capital Budget Review.  When do you think we can do this? 
 What do you think? 
 Cindy,  Please ask Stan if he is okey with the attached agenda for the Lay 2002 Plan Reviews. 
 okey.  I already responded that I could not meet on Friday.  Since we will be out of the office, I will need the extra time. 
 If they can split by business unit they must have by company.  The FERC nor the partnerships will accept these charges unless we have the data to send the costs to them.  I really need something like yesterday.  I thought we had this resolved a long time ago. 
 Thanks 
 I love to make you happy.  I have been having hot flashes all afternoon!  I would really like for you to spoil me forever.  I love you,  Tracy 
 I have attached examples from NNG presentation.  Lindy, you might want to use accountability slide format. 
 ETS  103 PGG  28 EREC 53.2 Azurix (not including Marlin) (5.2) Clean Fuels (21.1)  I need to double check this one this morning.  We talked about EGAS yesterday.  Its their 2nd CE plus ( in this case minus) the assets we have picked up.  We will review updated 4Q with Stan on Tuesday afternoon.  I will have to check with EEOS unless you already have.  Sorry for the delay, I had to talk to Rod. 
 I do not have a copy.  Steve Harris sent to Danny directly. 
 I would say expect to file to TW slide for Sun Devil.  I am checking on the connections to gas fired plants. 
 ask her to let us know the outcome of the conversation tomorrow asap.  thanks 
 The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.   Thanks  Tracy 
 I believe in 2001 it was $5.5.  Clean Fuels and HPL received some in 2001 and not any in 2002. 
 fyi 
 let me know if you have any comments as soon as possible.  thanks 
 What are these charges for? 
 approved for view only 
 Thursday morning works for me.  I would also like to include Jan Moore and Lindy Donoho.  Thanks 
 This should go against the environmental reserve on 1N9.  Can you help her out? 
 I have attached the current estimate.  I am not sure it is right because I was confused on how they have been booking it.  I feel comfortable that the total year is right.  Its the line that totals $118 for the year. 
 Attached is the resume for the interview I set up on Thursday, Oct. 18.  Rod at 2:30 and Michael at 3:00  Thanks 
 The 4th Quarter Forecast Meeting with Stan scheduled for Thursday, October 18 has been canceled.  Rod and I will meet with Stan separately.  Thanks  Tracy Geaccone 
   Steve Harris was still working on the TW presentation.  You or Mary Kay will have to call and ask him for it tomorrow.  Thanks  Tracy
