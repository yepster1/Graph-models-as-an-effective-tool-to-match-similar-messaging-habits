 is handling the meeting.  We can go over Lay review ideas again then.  The agenda for November 1 has you at 4:30 Houston time.  Will that work for you?  If not, are you comfortable with Tod doing it.  Just let me know what I can do to help.  Thanks  Tracy 
 Monday am or Tuesday am before all Employee meeting 
 9:00 Tuesday 
 I am not sure if this made it earlier or not 
 fyi 
 Good morning sweatheart. Its really hard for me to be away from you.  I think about you all the time.  I love to sleep next to you and wake up with you in the morning.  I really wanted to stay with you Saturday night.  Maybe I can work something out for this weekend.  Love you. 
 Any idea when or if we will receive the money? 
 Please plan to attend a run through with Danny of your 2002 Plan Presentations for the Lay Reviews on Thursday, October 25 from 9:00-11:00 in 42C2.  For Omaha room 696.  Thanks  Tracy

 This meeting has been moved to Friday, October 26 from 9:00-11:00 in EB 42C2, Omaha Room 696.  Thanks  Tracy 
 Danny has asked that you attend this meeting with him.  The ETS presentation is from 2:30-3:30.  Thanks  Tracy 
 We will meet in  EB 49C2 on Friday. 
 Rod thought you might want to sit in on this meeting.  Thanks  Tracy 
 Yes, I will work on it. 
 I know, I have these too. 
 Please send cookie bouquet from Rod and I. 
 I will do a little work on this side and get back to you. 
 Can you help me with this? 
 I really love you.  I can't wait to be with you this weekend.  I bet you are glad you listened to me and did not buy any Enron stock at $21, considering it is at $18 today!!!  Love you,  Tracy 
 FYI Tuesday, October 23 was Jan's 20 year anniversary with Enron. 
 I am planning to take her to lunch in a couple of weeks.  You will all be invited.  Thanks 
 thanks 
 I like the dinner group idea.  What about lunch on Monday, Oct 29? 
 I believe so because she is working on individual execs compensation.  Thanks 
 $2MM for what???? 
 Have the Steve Kean numbers been included in his budget and allocated out for 2002?  Thanks  Tracy 
 How about Nov 5 or 6? 
 FYI 
 ok 
 opps, forgot the attachements 
 It was on already on my calendar.  Thanks 
 I am ok. 
 sure 
 I really miss you, too.  I hope you had a good lunch.  Mine was quite an experience.  I will tell you later.  Did you spill anything on your clothes today?  Love you,  Tracy 
 No problem on the reschedule. What about Thursday, Nov. 1?  Actually, Jackie is going to stay with her friend Claire.  But, Garret is very excited about staying with Jake.  Will that be ok? 
 Approved.  Please roll over November 1.  Please let me know if there is a problem. 
 see question #3 
 Do you want to coordinate with Lisa? 
   Company name should be replaced by your business unit name. EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area. The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs. Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly. Please use the Arial font. It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.  We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.  I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at 9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.  I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.  On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.  If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372. 
  ETS             102.0 PGG              54.7  Includes GW adjustment $5.2 EGAS           (29.8)  Includes tranfers in and out of other groups.  Do we need to go over this to make sure the other groups are adjusted appropriately? EEOS           (35.9) EREC            51.2 AZURIX         (19.0) Clean Fuels   (21.1) --------- 103.6 
 Stan only mentioned Rod and myself.  You might ask him before I ask anyone else.  Thanks 
 I have to leave the office now.  I will call you around 11:00 and we can meet somewhere. OK. 
 Can you verify please 
 I will have Mary check into this when she gets back on Thursday.  I believe it should be part of the allocation. 
 We don't report this info separate.  I am afraid it will lead to alot more questions.   I would prefer system average.  Thanks 
 We should use previous quarter forecast. 
 I can't wait to see you tonight.  If you have alot of things to do at home, I don't mind driving to your house after Jackie's conference.   I have an Azurix 2002 Plan review from 2:30-4:30, so I will not be at your staff meeting.  I should be around until then.  Love you,  Red 
 I have some errands I need to run at lunch.  I can pick my things up then.  About Las Vegas,  I never received a confirm on Danny Gains last week.  I am not sure what happened, however, I called the Mirage directly and he is sold out that weekend.  Anything else you would like to see?  What about for dinner, any place special you would like to go? 
 I have spoken with Adam directly on this as well. 
 Can people dial in  internationally with this number? 
 Qestion 3:  84% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD. 
 Yes, Adam Umanoff needs it I believe.  Why don't you contact his assistant Lorraine Telles. 
 Yes, we will go ahead with the meeting.  Actually, I will cancel for everyone else and Rod and I will meet with Stan for November and December.  Thanks Tracy 
 Are we still going to do depreciation by function for the 2002 Plan? 
 yes 
 Yes, I will be there. 
 I also need to talk to you about EGS targets for 2002 today.  Thanks 
 lets discuss 
 Friday 2:00? 
 fyi 
 I should be able to make it at 1:30. 
 I would plan on being at the meeting around 3:45 it shouldn' t take more than 15 or 20 minutes.  Thanks  Tracy Geaccone 
 The O & M/G & A graph needs to be done in two graphs.  One for direct costs and one for Corporate costs.  This way you can better see the increase in the Corp costs.  Thanks  Tracy 
 yes 
 I miss you too. Lunch was good.  The bread pudding was the best part.  I wish I could have been with you.  Love you 
 I am not sure if I will be able to be the
