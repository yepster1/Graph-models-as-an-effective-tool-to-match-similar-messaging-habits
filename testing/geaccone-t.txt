an what was in the file you sent out.  I just wanted to make sure they were what you intended them to be. 
 Please make sure you inform the BUCs the new date it is due in to you. 
 I think you should include net commercial contribution as that is what Danny is responsible for.  Can you add to this schedule. 
 Please take care of this 
 I thought this was resolved.  I will follow up. 
 We need to get the common stock booked.  Please see below.  Thanks 
 I will do the planning for this company.  I assume Jennifer Lev's group will do the accounting as it is an ETS company.  Please let me know if you decide anything different.  Thanks 
 Wednesday 1:00-2:30 
 Can I go?    Rod Hayslett 
 I am having to reschedule because of Steve Harris' meeting.  I will let you know when I have a room. 
 We really don't want too many people at the meeting.  I am afraid the room will be overflowing.  Could you send Caroline and either Tony or Amy?  Thanks 
 Sorry, I left you off the distribution. 
 This year we will be looking at the income statement on a functional basis rather than a legal entity basis.  As such, it is important the you and/or your functional unit coordinator (BUC) attend these meetings.  Your BUC should be meeting with you prior to these meetings to review your numbers.  We sent a planning calendar out last week which shows when these meetings are scheduled.  You do not need to attend the pre-meetings.  Our first meeting with Stan for the first quarter is on Friday, February 23 at 3:30 in 49C2.  Please let me know if you did not receive the calendar or could not find it on the intranet. 
 How are you feeling?  Jon said you had some fluid removed from your lungs. = Did that go okey?  Lastest scoop.. Mike Moran is retiring. 
 I need this paid right away!!  I sent an e-mail out to you last month on this.  The expense needs to go against the environmental reserve on 1N9.  Please let me know the status. 
 fyi 
 Could you explain support for TW OBA reporting. 
 enjoy!!! 
 Please attend if possible. 
 I will call and let Lucindas know.  I have left you a voicemail to call me and tell about the soccer deal.  My number is 713-853-7372. 
 It could, but we don't know what Stan wants to talk about until we get closer.  It usually runs 5 or so hrs.  I would schedule 8 for now. 
 The invitation Rocio sent did not mention where the meeting is to be held on 2/20 at 9:00?????? 
 whenever your ready 
 How many will we have on Sunday and what time should we go? 
 I called everyone today.  The trip is to the ZOO.  I will let you know if anyone can't make it.  I have spoken to some and left messages for other. 
 Is this something worth checking into? 
 Welcome back.  All the statistical data is on the Investor relations website.  I don't have an extra one
