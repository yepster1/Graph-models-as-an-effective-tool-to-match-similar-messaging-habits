ss next week.  Regards Delainey 
 Any ideas?  These guys (John & Jere) just can't get it together.  Regards Delainey 
 Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern (especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.  This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.  Regards Delainey 
 Tom, you are making the right call - give me a day or two to manage the positions.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market group in east power and make a difference.  I would strongly support his movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.  I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets.  I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various desks.  The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.  Regards Delainey 
 This will confirm our dinner meeting to be held May 23, 2000 at the River Oaks Grill  DATE    MAY 23, 2000 PLACE   WINE ROOM RIVER OAKS GRILL 2630 WESTHEIMER (713) 520-1738 TIME    6:30 PM   If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Kay (30643) or Beverly (57857)  I will look forward to seeing you there. 
 Bill, can you set up a meeting to discuss credit issues. just you and I is fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, try and schedule me in 
 FYI 
 Larry and Joe,  Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has made a world of difference.  Regards Delainey 
 I am in Florida - I think I am available the night of the 24th for the baseball game.  Kay please follow up - I would like to make the game.  regards Delainey 
 Rob, Andy Fastow is the only one who has not signed the DASH.  He may have a few questions please give him a call.  Otherwise, Kay Chapman and/or Mark Frank have the DASH.  I have signed.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, please ensure that budgets and cost tracking similar to the peakers/Doyle are set up ASAP for Austin and Vitro.  These should be updated and circulated weely.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you or me to participate.  I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach.  I hope this meets with your approval.  Regards Delainey 
 Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, I forwarded your interest to Whalley, McConnel and McMahon.  Any=20 technology effort really should be lead by NetWorks.  This is consistent wi= th=20 Skillings strategy and what has been communicated to the analysts.  You=20 should receive a call from one of these gentlemen.  Regards Delainey 
 This looks good Mike - I appreciate the efforts.  Regard Delainey 
 Looks rather impressive.  Good job.  Regards Delainey 
 Jere, please forward the list of targets. Let me speak initially with John - lets try and get this done today.  I appreciate the effort on the peakers. As well, I would suggest we start discussions with  Reeding & Bates which according to both Redmond and Thompson is a live deal.  Thanks Delainey 
 Thxs Joe -much appreciated. Dave 
 Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front, expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and budgeted next.  Let discuss  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I appreciate the updates. Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.  You will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we get over the goal line.  Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior level.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at Gleason?  Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.  Do we have a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?  Please advise.  Thanks Delainey 
 Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.  We still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.  I believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.  Thanks.  Regards Delainey 
 Lew, it looks like I have some appointments I can't get out of on the 24th; however, we could be out there by noon on the 25th.  How does that fit?  I did get a call from Mike letting me know that he would be sending over the CA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I thought we were targeting 750 MW.  What is the updated availability schedule for each unit?  We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.  Please advise.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike Moulton has been pursuing an idea in the technology area for a while. = =20 The sponsorship of this idea clearly fits in Net Works.  Could one of you= =20 fine gentlemen give his idea a test drive?  I would much appreciate if you= =20 could give him a call.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, you need to make your own call on that one - I think you could add value in either.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, when did BP Amoco get involved?  I thought we were dealing with Avista.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, what is our emissions strategy for these counterparties?  Regards Delainey 
 both 
 Maybe that commercial is closer than to the truth than I thought ...... Regards Delainey 
 Sounds good - I think you have a great opportunity in this market - I would suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage.  I note the associate needs.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken. I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the first world is out this week.  I ask for your patience.  Lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Sounds good - lets see if we can start marketing the product and the capability.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, I will want to see those economics.  Thanks Delainey 
 David, once you get the demand lets discuss before deployment.  Regards Delainey 
 That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI incorporate the write downs we think should occur?  Regards Delainey 
 Gere, just following up on the offsite - have you all agreed on the target producer list for the insurance product?  How is the peaker product developing?  Regards Delainey 
 How do we immunize ourselves from the workouts being shed into Raptor?  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, who is working on the Duke restructuring now?  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, I can't open - please send hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Shelly, I would like for David and I to handle this process from the Office of the Chair in order to ensure an orderly deployment of needed resources. Please facilitate through Mr. Oxley.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, sorry for the delay - lets talk if you think it is warranted.  I can see a lot of positives to take this path. However,  there are a) pr issues and b) we have hoards of on-going litigation that cost us a bundle.  We should make this decision very carefully.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 just send it out to the affected parties.  thxs dave 
 all yours 
 Just practicing apathy.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, I forwarded a message to you from Sheri Sierra from a gentleman looking for energy mgt services in Japan.  I had asked you to forward to Joe Hirl.  Please follow up with Joe.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please ensure I get to this.  Thxs Dave 
 ?????? 
 Vicki, how much $$ are we talking about for the bankruptcy and the class action suit? It does not seem inappropriate for us to share the bankruptcy costs given the CTC issue.  I agree with you on the class action suit.  Lets discuss further before we approach ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, are we in London during this event? Regards Delainey 
 Brett, got it covered.  thanks Dave 
 Steve, what is the status?  Regards Delainey 
 Peggy, the last version I read was fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Sherri, I will be there.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John about this?  I am supportive of this proposal and approach.  Like our discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.  We also have to support Lay's efforts in California.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, fyi  Regards Dave 
 John, I spoke to Milly - he is on side.  I have completed all reviews except Kishkill and Orlando - how do you want to handle this?  Regards Delainey 
 thanks Peter - and congrats on the promotion well deserved.  Keep actively managing constructively your constituency in Houston.  Regards Delainey 
 thxs ben - i'm sure our paths will cross again.  best of luck.  regards delainey 
 thanks Rick  By the way, JCP is being restructured or killed.  Regards Delainey 
 David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America. There are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back and risk offices of the company.  We are working quickly to rectify  - servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.  On the European side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.  Regards Delainehy 
 Shawn, just a little buried - why don't you come by on Monday. Kay please schedule.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, I will forward his voice mail to you.  EES has enough challenges in NA and Europe before tackling retail products and services in a market with no wholesale market.  Please follow up.  Thanks Delainey 
 no 
 Chris, I would get Mark or Louise involved at this point - if it is mission critical let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Matthew, sounds fine - I will have Kay start managing the calendar.  Regards Delainey 
 Matthew, if you know my reputation, I tend not to be a big fan of these type of events either - however, at this point, I need to collect more information on the event and I think it inappropriate to cancel at this late stage. Going forward, I think we as a management team including yourself should discuss what the strategy should be going forward.  Don't hesitate to voice your opinion.  Regards Delainey 
 Hey Crystal hope things are well ....  Dawna is fine. We have two girls six (Kassandra) and four (Samantha).  We have been in Houston now three and half years.  It has been a good move from a career point of view.  Obviously, you had heard my move from Pres./CEO of Enron North America to Chair/CEO of EES.  I hope life has been as kind to you.  Best of luck in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, please let Brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify.  It is difficult for me to be responsive otherwise.  Thanks Dave 
 Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give you a call to discuss further.  Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:  - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March.  PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.  Talk to you soon!!  Regards Delainey 
 I'm sorry Bob - AMPS 
 Bob, please give me an update on our progress on this item and the viability of the technology.  Regards Delainey 
 Richard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray Bowen's business.  In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility.  In my EES shoes, I would like to take a closer look at the possible connections.  Please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio.  I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on the Catalytica investment.  With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, I appreciate your note and I am sure that you will work well with Chris.  I have always believed in your talents and capabilities - I won't be far ....  Regards Delainey 
 Ed, thanks for the note - hope things are going well.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon enough, I am around all day today.  Regards Delainey 
 thsx for the note Dick - look forward to working with you.  regards Delainey 
 thxs Ricardo  regards Delainey 
 thsx for the note Stuart - I've heard great things about you and I look forward to working with you.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 thxs Chris - look forward to working with you again.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, thanks for the note - look forward to working with you - you did a great job for me in ENA, I'm sure that will continue.  regards Delainey 
 thxs for the note - I was aware of the possibility of my leaving; however, I really felt you needed to make your next step based on your own decisions with no outside pressure or bias.  regards Delainey 
 thsx for the note Becky.  regards delainey 
 Tim, I appreciate the note and the comments - I may need some of your help in the future as we bring this patient back to health.  Regards Delainey 
 guys, I am out of town - John you will have to represent EA.  Regards Delainey 
 thxs for the note - all the best  regards delainey 
 i'll be back .... thanks for the note ....  regards delainey 
 thxs sandra  regards delainey 
 ok, let me put something together on e-mail over the next day or so - otherwise we will plan to be in Europe over the next 4 weeks or so.  regards delainey 
 Rick, I need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board:  - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco) - Ahlstrom (QF Purchase) - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators) - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not) - sale of ECP (assume not) - sale of HPL (assume not).

 Thanks Dave  Regards Delainey 
 fyi, action 
 Matthew, would your Monday meeting be a good time (if the time change works) for me to introduce myself and say a few words via video conference or the like to your organization?  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, I need your re-submission of the plan document including goals and objective asap so that we can have a final discussion and finalize.  We should also set up some time to finalize your review.  Regards Delainey 
 Laura, I know you are busy but I need your plan submission asap so that we can discuss and finalize.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, has Jeff Rubin confirmed his availability on December 14th from 4:00 to 5:30PM to give us a macro-economic overview ?  Regards Delainey 
 a) year end reviews - report needs generating like mid-year documenting business unit performance on review completion - David to John; b) work out or plan generation for the NIM/Issues employees - David to John; c) HPL transition issues - ongoing.  Officially transferred.  Regards Delainey 
 Jaime, appreciate all your efforts and I am sure you will find a way to hit your targets this year.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, Brian Redmond  Dave 
 FYI 
 John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman paragraph:  "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES business model.  In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Currently, Janet is Managing Director in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination organizations."  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, write these down in pencil - I need a chance to review.  thanks Dave 
 FYI, refer to previous note. 
 FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a transaction.  The proposal includes: a) traded power products of various sizes and terms; b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) for term; c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts; and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.  I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.  Regards Delainey 
 working it 
 Dan, should we put more meat on this bone?  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, the CALME organization does not exist so it might be difficult to negotiate a transfer price - we need to just do the right thing for Enron - if you think you are getting stuffed economically then I would work a deal out with Lavo or Whalley.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as a follow on to our discussion last week:  a) run the RFP for VN service for Electro - variety of terms, volumes  as per our discussion - next thirty days - Orlando; b) explore the possibility of adding four additional LM's to the Electrobolt structure as a form of generation mitigation for the Electro short - would Petrobras be open to this discussion and what would be the last date that we would have to call NTP to get in on time to make 2003 - Joe; c) as much information on the nature of the Electro short and any customer contractual positions that can be provided to Lavo to start estimating the value  of the possible straddle - Orlando d) re-run the Cuiba MTM model given changing cost parameters, fuel issues and timing to determine what the possible hit may be and what are the mitigants - Joe; e) re-run budget numbers with correct view on re-organization costs - Joe; f) view on financial budget and strategic goals for 2001 and feedback to ESA - Lavo/Delainey; g) update commercial org chart reflecting discussions about the origination teams - Joe; and h) clarification on sale and asset responsibility in SA on a go forward basis given changing opinions on effectiveness of current organization - Lavo.  Outsourcing contacts: a) PetroCanada/Suncor - Eric LeDain b) Peoples Gas  - Laura Luce c) Virginia Natural Gas - Ed McMichael d) Brooklyn Union - Ed McMichael  Regards Delainey 
 fyi, action 
 Ken, I will drive by - I am interested in looking at a few options.  thanks Dave 
 Wes, do you have the first cut?  John you need to have some input.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave Delainey has asked to have the following meeting arranged:   Date:  Friday February 2, 2001  Time:  10:30 am - 11:30 am  Location: EB 3321  Topic:  California Update   Please let me know if you have any questions or conflicts.  Thanks,  Kay   3-0643 
 Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.  Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital side.  Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities. It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process. How should we participate in this market?  Gasification technology?  Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc.  Specifically, how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model?  How are we positioning ourselves in this market?  What is the PI strategy with this regard?  Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, we need a first cut by December 8th.  Thanks Delainey 
 Guys, do we have enough VAR to bring this position into the book?  If over $5M in total exposure it has to go to Frevert/Whalley.  John, I assume that you have gone through the transaction and have approved.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, sounds like we are moving backwards - but these guys tend to jump the gun at times.  If it is not possible for these orgs to work together lets not try and force them (ie) we will manage our own business and contract with NEPCO when and if it makes sense.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave has asked that a Staff Meeting be scheduled for Wednesday February 7, 2001, from 3:00 pm til 5:00 pm in 30C1.  Please mark your calendar and plan to attend.  If you have any questions and/or conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay 3-0643).    Thanks,  Kay 
 Janet, if you are ok, I'm ok - we usually only sign these type of non-solicitations, stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the counterparty.  Otherwise, it becomes a nightmare to manage all these.  I will leave it to your discretion.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I assume that you are doing Lydecker, Maffitt and Detmering's review.  thanks Dave 
 These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion: - Dave Duran - Joe Deffner - Tammy Sheppherd - Scott Josey - Brian Redmond - Rob Milnthorp - Janet Dietrich - Chris Calger - John Thompson - Max Yzaguirre - Jeff Donahue - Wes Colwell - Kay Chapman  David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.  I would suggest that we follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at mid-year.  I would shoot for 100% participation target.  How are we making out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, I assume that you are doing the review for Bob Virgo, Wayne Mays, Jean Mrha and Julie Gomez.  Regards Delainey 
 John, I assume that you are doing the review for Vince Kaminski.  Thanks Dave 
 Jeff, I assume that you are providing a review for Mike L Miller.  Thanks Dave 
 Guys, I do not have any material that Brian, Tim or Wes would not  have in their files.  Regards Delainey 
 Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan (ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for questions.  The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.  Could you have a first cut by December 8th?  Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.  Regards Delainey 
 ok, your call - do we have some spares available if needed?  regards Delainey 
 Kevin, the only thing to keep in mind are the patent issues on the DLN - the GE settlement prevents PSM from re-manufacturing any further "tainted" product including spares for the existing DLN system - how might this affect our reliability at peak times?  Regards Delainey 
 John, what do you want to do with this?  We had discussed but I wanted to follow up.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I'm a lowly piker but I will try to help.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, where do we stand with Tom and the replacement combustion systems?  Regards Delainey 
 Yours! 
 Guys, I'm not the sharing type  - book me in the Forest Room.  Regards Delainey 
 Greg, nothing that pressing - I was just wondering how things were going and wanted to catch up on few things.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you work with Milly on this issue.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, can you discuss with the other groups to appropriately sort out the corporate opportunity (ie) Laura, Hunter, etc.  Thxz Dave 
 Kyle, sounds like a good deal - look forward to this play bearing fruit.  Thanks Dave 
 Kay, please ensure that her expense statements are signed by me.  Regards Delainey 
 yes 
 Hey, Rob try and keep under $100K US.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, if you and Dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the short run as we gear up I am supportive.  I assume this will be covered in Canada's budget.  Send me a towel.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay please send regrets - I think I am in Canada.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split for the business?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, you should be there if possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, can you give me the particulars on the four MEH turbines (ie) scheduled delivery, price, fuel options, heat rate, output,etc - including transferablility to NA.  Regards Delainey 
 Milly is ok; however, I would like a quick read of the document once you send a hard copy up...  Regards Delainey 
 Can we realistically net transmission costs against CTC undercollections for EES?  If there is a credible argument we should discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, we need to get this moving before the coal group starts occupying the space.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I am in complete agreement on the strategy.  This has been discussed for some time, Dave Duran and his group have distinct goals to move this strategy forward in 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Scud incoming.... 
 Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and expensive, are being discouraged.  I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I don't see a need for more than one per year.  Please manage through PR - Dorie Hitchcock - she will  require an agenda as part of the approval process.  I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of the offsite.  If you have some concerns lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Jean, the $6M was a negotiated settlement between me and Marty Rosenberg of several old disputes as we moved forward in the restructuring of the Independence plant earlier in the year - Ruth added little other than administrative support.  Regards Delainey 
 George, it was good to hear from you - please follow up with David Oxley to determine possible roles within ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting together your offsite presentations.  Each group will have approximately one hour to one hour and half.  A suggested format would include (for East Power, East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas): a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc; b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination opportunities for 2001); c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow; d) what worked in 2000 what didn't; and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc.  In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other goals in 2001.  Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.  Thanks  Delainey 
 Brian, good memo - I think you mean't Energy Capital Resources not Enron Capital Resources in your memo.  I would distribute widely in the management ranks.  Regards Delainey 
 get rid of this please 
 Dave Delainey has asked me to arrange an offsite for January 16 & 17, at the St Regis Hotel, 1919 Briar Oaks Lane, Houston, Texas  77027.  If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay) @ 3-0643, otherwise, please mark your calendar and plan to attend:    Date:  Tuesday   January 16, 2001 Wednesday  January 17, 2001  Time:  10:00 am until  5:00 pm (Tuesday and Wednesday)  Location: The St. Regis Hotel 1919 Briar Oaks Lane Houston, Texas  77027 Phone:  713-840-7600 Fax:       713-840-7617   Thanks,  Kay 
 Would this guy be a candidate for the LTP?  Regards Delainey 
 What is this?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or "cover our backsides";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly. Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ENA.  I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading floor.  I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas business.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, please give me your thoughts via e -mail asap. I believe this will be the most effective tool.  Please give me your expectations as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Go go go....!!  Show us how the retail/wholesale business should work together. Great job!  Regards Delainey 
 Christy, can we send these documents in word format - I'm not sure if this is a problem for everyone but I can never open these attachments from Braeswell.  Can you please send a hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Marty, looks like this nut may have some fruit. I look forward to continuing our discussions from 2000 on how we can be better together - I am committed to doing this the right way as I know you are.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, what is your view?  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, give them what they want and lets move on - don't give another guarantee provide the indemnity for the IRS and environmental claims.  Mark if there is a flaw in my thinking let me know.  Joe, these guys have been exceedingly difficult to deal with - I would think twice before we bring these guys into any Enron deal in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, send to John Sherriff in Europe.  Regards Delainey 
 None - except for Enron comp (options et al). 
 Janet, don't trip me up until after January 15. 
 Mark, do we really want a story on SA at this point? Seems we have better things to talk about at this point in time.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, are we closed out on this job with NEPCO as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, work with Dorie Hitchcock and get an estimate/approval memo put together.  Regards Delainey 
 I have certainly missed your one liners - I will give you a call first thing tommorrow.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, we are planning to file the following protest of HQ's behaviour in the NE power markets through their market based rates case with the FERC, do you have any issues with this approach?  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, go ahead and have the meeting - I think I know what it is about.  Let me know what you guys want to do.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, I noticed that Laura Scott is not on the list for non-commercial VP candidate but Georgiana and Sherman were - did you change your mind?  I think you have until the 4th to put up your candidates.  Regards Delainey 
 yes - we should arrange to get together on Sunday to discuss bonus, comp, promotions and rankings before the PRC on Monday.  I am back Saturday night. I hope this works let me know a time.    Regards Delainey 
 Wes, that is fine - flush it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, in addition please incorporate in each teams package - their Direct Expense/Headcount ratio to plan average, Productivity ratio to plan average and team ROCE to plan average and any variances from 2000 to 2001 for income/expenses taking into account our most latest 2000 forecasts by group.  Wes, I assume that you will be putting together a final 2000 i/s package for me in the next couple of days.  Thanks Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's review and then detailed review with each team.  This workbook has a number of worksheets including: a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC; b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be offset by larger monetizations; c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external capital charges are added back to reach EBIT; d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget; e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups and bonus/other comp; f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond; g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then calculates a net capital and depreciation charge; h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are charged @ a blended rate of 9%.  Two action items: a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his comment and review & b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet (including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.    Regards Delainey 
 Janet, between you, Laura and Frank/Gil you should  be able to field a one Enron team on this one.  I am at your disposal otherwise.  Laura/Frank - this is an important one for the team - please work together constructively.  Gil should continue in his current role as main relationship manager unless you guys change your mind.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, great job on this one.....  2001 - should be a big year for Mexico: a) equity sell down of the Monterrey project; b) close and further sell down of the Tex Mex project; and c) 20% growth on risk mgt volumes and income from 2000 levels.   Thanks for the great work.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, thanks for the update - ensure that Azurix is eliminated from the project which can help financially support the Calpine water discount.  Do not hesitate to contact Amanda Martin or Garrisson directly on this one if needed.  What is the status of LV?  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I believe a current board member is likely to be picked - last I heard the mayor of Tupelo.  Craven will be in office until May.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, for US applications dual fuel may be important for Florida - maybe less in California.  Do we need it for Rio Gen or Cuiba?  Can you follow up with Chris Calger and Janet Dietrich to get their views.  Thanks Delainey 
 Lisa, I currently work in ENA as CEO and President - mostly nat gas and electricity.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, sorry for the delay - I think that Chris Calger who runs our Western development efforts would be very interested.  Chris please give Rebecca a call.   Regards Delainey 
 Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or comments in the press release.  As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said without reflecting poorly on the buyer.  I would suggest that we approve an AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.  If we have not already, I would not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave will be out of the office December 23, 2000 until Monday, January 8, 2001.  He will be checking his voicemail and will have his cell phone.  The following are the numbers where he can be reached:   December 24  thru December 26 - Saskatoon, SK   (306) 374-9587 or Cell Phone   (713) 907-6315  December 27 thru January 7 - Fairmont, B.C.

 rick, have a good holiday - John and I appreciate the support you and your group have provided.  regards Delainey 
 Bill, I think you are confusing me with John Lavorato my COO.  I am a University of Saskatchewan grad.  Regardless, if I can help lets discuss in the new year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you put together the folllowing Portfolio/Charter Review for Principal Investing and Energy Capital Resources: a) detail existing portfolio - winners/losers; additions/deletions and overall performance; b) detail market conditions in your markets and any strategy changes following; c) anticipated major transactions in 2001; and d) review charter and detail any proposed changes.  I would anticipate that we sit down with Rick and Jeff at the end of January - please have package available for my review by mid January.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, it will have to wait - I will be back in early January.  Regards Delainey 
 thanks Susan  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to schedule a meeting the you today to discuss HPL...... Would 4:00 pm be ok with all of you....???  please let me know your availability as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI 
 This looks good... all your cc are good and he said to send to all ENA=20 Employees.......  Thanks again for all your help......This will be out tomorrow morning,=20 correct ?????  Thanks,  Kay 
 Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget. My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like #1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end of the scale and early.  Drop me a note on where you end up.  Regards Delainey 
 whats up?  Dave 
 John, I need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.  Thanks Dave 
 Barry need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday  Thanks Dave 
 Janet, need 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology for Ben Jacoby and Ed McMichael before Friday - please follow up.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, need your 2000 acoomplishments before Friday.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I need your 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.  Thxs Dave 
 Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.  Regards Delainey 
 Attached please find the final presentation for the board meeting tommorrow. I assume that RAC will have the resolutions and DASH.  Regards Delainey 
 This should be sent from John and me - Enron Americas, Office of the Chairman to all commercial and support employees in Enron North America.  In addition, copy to Joe Kishkill, Orlando Gonzales, Brett Wiggs and Remi Collognes in Enron South America.  As well, include Jeff Shankman, Mike McConnell, Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen, Louise Kitchen, Phillipe Bibi, Rebecca McDonald, Jim Hughes, Mark Frevert, Greg Whalley.  Please ensure that I am able to proof the final copy before distributing.  I would like to have this by Wednesday night in everyone's e-mail Thursday morning.  Regards Dave 
 Rebecca, lets just go forward with HPL on Thursday - Tex Mex, after going through with the deal team, still has some issues to be resolved.  We will push this into Q1.  The HPL deal is anticipated to be signed on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca. attached you will find the presentation for the HPL deal.  Please forward to Jeff.  If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to give me a call.  Regards Delainey 
 yes thxs dave 
 Randy, looks like a good solution - well done.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to October 31,2002.  It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is a breach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30, 2002.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a draft org memo that I anticpate going out on Thursday.  I appreciate your patience.  Please give me any comments ASAP (only major issues).  Brian/Tim, I assume that we need a communication strategy to HPL employees before this memo goes out - please advise.  Please keep this note confidential until release.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, this looks fine.  Regards Delainey 
 As I had indicated before please work through me or Brett - otherwise we risk our ability to move them - please forward appropriately.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, please have someone draft up a short speech for this function.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, under the assumption that we are not over-paying for the land and that the site has option value beyond the Petrobras deal, I am ok with the purchase.  Regards Delainey 
 Patrick, there are two pages missing (ie) Earnings & ROCE.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I assume you are keeping an eye on "California East".  Any help you can give Kevin would be much appreciated.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you set up some time - perhaps in the new year for a lunch - my office should be fine.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 David, good to hear from you - I am sure we will cross paths in your career with Enron.  All the best Delainey 
 FYI see attached    Regards Delainey 
 Angela,  Is Dave supposed to be involved in this ?????  I just happened to be in Dave's email looking for something for him........I saw your name and thought maybe I'd better see if this was something I needed to put on his calendar.....As a rule, I do not go into Dave's  email unless I am told or looking for something that someone has requested me to print and give to him.....so, if you need something to be put on his calendar, please copy me on it or chances are I may or may not find out about it...  Thanks,  Kay 
 Stuart, only New Albany and Doyle would be left.  As you have indicated, Doyle is 100% committed to Ogelthorpe.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 fyi 
 Ben, please discuss with Dave Duran - he will be responsible for our coal generation strategy.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, I will try and call you on Monday - I spoke to Kish about Arcor - he is working on it.  Hang in there ....  Regards Delainey
