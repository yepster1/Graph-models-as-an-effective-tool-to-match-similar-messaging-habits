this investment is currently in Ray Bowen's business.  In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility.  In my EES shoes, I would like to take a closer look at the possible connections.  Please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio.  I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on the Catalytica investment.  With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, I appreciate your note and I am sure that you will work well with Chris.  I have always believed in your talents and capabilities - I won't be far ....  Regards Delainey 
 Ed, thanks for the note - hope things are going well.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon enough, I am around all day today.  Regards Delainey

 Thanks Dave  Regards Delainey 
 fyi, action 
 Rick, I need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board:  - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco) - Ahlstrom (QF Purchase) - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators) - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not) - sale of ECP (assume not) - sale of HPL (assume not).  Regards Delainey 
 Matthew, would your Monday meeting be a good time (if the time change works) for me to introduce myself and say a few words via video conference or the like to your organization?  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, I need your re-submission of the plan document including goals and objective asap so that we can have a final discussion and finalize.  We should also set up some time to finalize your review.  Regards Delainey 
 Laura, I know you are busy but I need your plan submission asap so that we can discuss and finalize.  Regards Delainey 
 a) year end reviews - report needs generating like mid-year documenting business unit performance on review completion - David to John; b) work out or plan generation for the NIM/Issues employees - David to John; c) HPL transition issues - ongoing.  Officially transferred.  Regards Delainey 
 Jaime, appreciate all your efforts and I am sure you will find a way to hit your targets this year.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, Brian Redmond  Dave 
 FYI 
 Joe, has Jeff Rubin confirmed his availability on December 14th from 4:00 to 5:30PM to give us a macro-economic overview ?  Regards Delainey 
 John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman paragraph:  "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES business model.  In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Currently, Janet is Managing Director in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination organizations."  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, write these down in pencil - I need a chance to review.  thanks Dave 
 FYI, refer to previous note. 
 FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a transaction.  The proposal includes: a) traded power products of various sizes and terms; b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) for term; c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts; and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.  I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, should we put more meat on this bone?  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, the CALME organization does not exist so it might be difficult to negotiate a transfer price - we need to just do the right thing for Enron - if you think you are getting stuffed economically then I would work a deal out with Lavo or Whalley.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as a follow on to our discussion last week:  a) run the RFP for VN service for Electro - variety of terms, volumes  as per our discussion - next thirty days - Orlando; b) explore the possibility of adding four additional LM's to the Electrobolt structure as a form of generation mitigation for the Electro short - would Petrobras be open to this discussion and what would be the last date that we would have to call NTP to get in on time to make 2003 - Joe; c) as much information on the nature of the Electro short and any customer contractual positions that can be provided to Lavo to start estimating the value  of the possible straddle - Orlando d) re-run the Cuiba MTM model given changing cost parameters, fuel issues and timing to determine what the possible hit may be and what are the mitigants - Joe; e) re-run budget numbers with correct view on re-organization costs - Joe; f) view on financial budget and strategic goals for 2001 and feedback to ESA - Lavo/Delainey; g) update commercial org chart reflecting discussions about the origination teams - Joe; and h) clarification on sale and asset responsibility in SA on a go forward basis given changing opinions on effectiveness of current organization - Lavo.  Outsourcing contacts: a) PetroCanada/Suncor - Eric LeDain b) Peoples Gas  - Laura Luce c) Virginia Natural Gas - Ed McMichael d) Brooklyn Union - Ed McMichael  Regards Delainey 
 fyi, action 
 working it 
 Ken, I will drive by - I am interested in looking at a few options.  thanks Dave 
 Wes, do you have the first cut?  John you need to have some input.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave Delainey has asked to have the following meeting arranged:   Date:  Friday February 2, 2001  Time:  10:30 am - 11:30 am  Location: EB 3321  Topic:  California Update   Please let me know if you have any questions or conflicts.  Thanks,  Kay   3-0643 
 Guys, do we have enough VAR to bring this position into the book?  If over $5M in total exposure it has to go to Frevert/Whalley.  John, I assume that you have gone through the transaction and have approved.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, sounds like we are moving backwards - but these guys tend to jump the gun at times.  If it is not possible for these orgs to work together lets not try and force them (ie) we will manage our own business and contract with NEPCO when and if it makes sense.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave has asked that a Staff Meeting be scheduled for Wednesday February 7, 2001, from 3:00 pm til 5:00 pm in 30C1.  Please mark your calendar and plan to attend.  If you have any questions and/or conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay 3-0643).    Thanks,  Kay 
 Janet, if you are ok, I'm ok - we usually only sign these type of non-solicitations, stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the counterparty.  Otherwise, it becomes a nightmare to manage all these.  I will leave it to your discretion.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I assume that you are doing Lydecker, Maffitt and Detmering's review.  thanks Dave 
 Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.  Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital side.  Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities. It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process. How should we participate in this market?  Gasification technology?  Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc.  Specifically, how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model?  How are we positioning ourselves in this market?  What is the PI strategy with this regard?  Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, we need a first cut by December 8th.  Thanks Delainey 
 These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion: - Dave Duran - Joe Deffner - Tammy Sheppherd - Scott Josey - Brian Redmond - Rob Milnthorp - Janet Dietrich - Chris Calger - John Thompson - Max Yzaguirre - Jeff Donahue - Wes Colwell - Kay Chapman  David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.  I would suggest that we follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at mid-year.  I would shoot for 100% participation target.  How are we making out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, I assume that you are doing the review for Bob Virgo, Wayne Mays, Jean Mrha and Julie Gomez.  Regards Delainey 
 John, I assume that you are doing the review for Vince Kaminski.  Thanks Dave 
 Jeff, I assume that you are providing a review for Mike L Miller.  Thanks Dave 
 Guys, I do not have any material that Brian, Tim or Wes would not  have in their files.  Regards Delainey 
 ok, your call - do we have some spares available if needed?  regards Delainey 
 Kevin, the only thing to keep in mind are the patent issues on the DLN - the GE settlement prevents PSM from re-manufacturing any further "tainted" product including spares for the existing DLN system - how might this affect our reliability at peak times?  Regards Delainey 
 John, what do you want to do with this?  We had discussed but I wanted to follow up.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I'm a lowly piker but I will try to help.  Regards Delainey 
 Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan (ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for questions.  The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.  Could you have a first cut by December 8th?  Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, where do we stand with Tom and the replacement combustion systems?  Regards Delainey 
 Yours! 
 Guys, I'm not the sharing type  - book me in the Forest Room.  Regards Delainey 
 Greg, nothing that pressing - I was just wondering how things were going and wanted to catch up on few things.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you work with Milly on this issue.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, can you discuss with the other groups to appropriately sort out the corporate opportunity (ie) Laura, Hunter, etc.  Thxz Dave 
 Kyle, sounds like a good deal - look forward to this play bearing fruit.  Thanks Dave 
 Kay, please ensure that her expense statements are signed by me.  Regards Delainey 
 yes 
 Hey, Rob try and keep under $100K US.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, if you and Dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the short run as we gear up I am supportive.  I assume this will be covered in Canada's budget.  Send me a towel.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay please send regrets - I think I am in Canada.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split for the business?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, you should be there if possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Can we realistically net transmission costs against CTC undercollections for EES?  If there is a credible argument we should discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, we need to get this moving before the coal group starts occupying the space.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I am in complete agreement on the strategy.  This has been discussed for some time, Dave Duran and his group have distinct goals to move this strategy forward in 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Scud incoming.... 
 Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and expensive, are being discouraged.  I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I don't see a need for more than one per year.  Please manage through PR - Dorie Hitchcock - she will  require an agenda as part of the approval process.  I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of the offsite.  If you have some concerns lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, can you give me the particulars on the four MEH turbines (ie) scheduled delivery, price, fuel options, heat rate, output,etc - including transferablility to NA.  Regards Delainey 
 Milly is ok; however, I would like a quick read of the document once you send a hard copy up...  Regards Delainey 
 Jean, the $6M was a negotiated settlement between me and Marty Rosenberg of several old disputes as we moved forward in the restructuring of the Independence plant earlier in the year - Ruth added little other than administrative support.  Regards Delainey 
 George, it was good to hear from you - please follow up with David Oxley to determine possible roles within ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, good memo - I think you mean't Energy Capital Resources not Enron Capital Resources in your memo.  I would distribute widely in the management ranks.  Regards Delainey 
 get rid of this please 
 Dave Delainey has asked me to arrange an offsite for January 16 & 17, at the St Regis Hotel, 1919 Briar Oaks Lane, Houston, Texas  77027.  If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay) @ 3-0643, otherwise, please mark your calendar and plan to attend:    Date:  Tuesday   January 16, 2001 Wednesday  January 17, 2001  Time:  10:00 am until  5:00 pm (Tuesday and Wednesday)  Location: The St. Regis Hotel 1919 Briar Oaks Lane Houston, Texas  77027 Phone:  713-840-7600 Fax:       713-840-7617   Thanks,  Kay 
 Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting together your offsite presentations.  Each group will have approximately one hour to one hour and half.  A suggested format would include (for East Power, East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas): a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc; b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination opportunities for 2001); c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow; d) what worked in 2000 what didn't; and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc.  In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other goals in 2001.  Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.  Thanks  Delainey 
 Would this guy be a candidate for the LTP?  Regards Delainey 
 What is this?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or "cover our backsides";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly. Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ENA.  I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading floor.  I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas business.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, please give me your thoughts via e -mail asap. I believe this will be the most effective tool.  Please give me your expectations as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Go go go....!!  Show us how the retail/wholesale business should work together. Great job!  Regards Delainey 
 Marty, looks like this nut may have some fruit. I look forward to continuing our discussions from 2000 on how we can be better together - I am committed to doing this the right way as I know you are.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, what is your view?  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, give them what they want and lets move on - don't give another guarantee provide the indemnity for the IRS and environmental claims.  Mark if there is a flaw in my thinking let me know.  Joe, these guys have been exceedingly difficult to deal with - I would think twice before we bring these guys into any Enron deal in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, send to John Sherriff in Europe.  Regards Delainey 
 None - except for Enron comp (options et al). 
 Christy, can we send these documents in word format - I'm not sure if this is a problem for everyone but I can never open these attachments from Braeswell.  Can you please send a hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, don't trip me up until after January 15. 
 Mark, do we really want a story on SA at this point? Seems we have better things to talk about at this point in time.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, are we closed out on this job with NEPCO as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, work with Dorie Hitchcock and get an estimate/approval memo put together.  Regards Delainey 
 I have certainly missed your one liners - I will give you a call first thing tommorrow.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, go ahead and have the meeting - I think I know what it is about.  Let me know what you guys want to do.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, I noticed that Laura Scott is not on the list for non-commercial VP candidate but Georgiana and Sherman were - did you change your mind?  I think you have until the 4th to put up your candidates.  Regards Delainey 
 yes - we should arrange to get together on Sunday to discuss bonus, comp, promotions and rankings before the PRC on Monday.  I am back Saturday night. I hope this works let me know a time.    Regards Delainey 
 Wes, that is fine - flush it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, in addition please incorporate in each teams package - their Direct Expense/Headcount ratio to plan average, Productivity ratio to plan average and team ROCE to plan average and any variances from 2000 to 2001 for income/expenses taking into account our most latest 2000 forecasts by group.  Wes, I assume that you will be putting together a final 2000 i/s package for me in the next couple of days.  Thanks Delainey 
 Rob, we are planning to file the following protest of HQ's behaviour in the NE power markets through their market based rates case with the FERC, do you have any issues with this approach?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's review and then detailed review with each team.  This workbook has a number of worksheets including: a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC; b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be offset by larger monetizations; c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external capital charges are added back to reach EBIT; d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget; e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups and bonus/other comp; f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond; g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then calculates a net capital and depreciation charge; h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are charged @ a blended rate of 9%.  Two action items: a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his comment and review & b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet (including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.    Regards Delainey 
 Janet, between you, Laura and Frank/Gil you should  be able to field a one Enron team on this one.  I am at your disposal otherwise.  Laura/Frank - this is an important one for the team - please work together constructively.  Gil should continue in his current role as main relationship manager unless you guys change your mind.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, great job on this one.....  2001 - should be a big year for Mexico: a) equity sell down of the Monterrey project; b) close and further sell down of the Tex Mex project; and c) 20% growth on risk mgt volumes and income from 2000 levels.   Thanks for the great work.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, thanks for the update - ensure that Azurix is eliminated from the project which can help financially support the Calpine water discount.  Do not hesitate to contact Amanda Martin or Garrisson directly on this one if needed.  What is the status of LV?  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I believe a current board member is likely to be picked - last I heard the mayor of Tupelo.  Craven will be in office until May.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, for US applications dual fuel may be important for Florida - maybe less in California.  Do we need it for Rio Gen or Cuiba?  Can you follow up with Chris Calger and Janet Dietrich to get their views.  Thanks Delainey 
 Lisa, I currently work in ENA as CEO and President - mostly nat gas and electricity.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, sorry for the delay - I think that Chris Calger who runs our Western development efforts would be very interested.  Chris please give Rebecca a call.   Regards Delainey 
 Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or comments in the press release.  As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said without reflecting poorly on the buyer.  I would suggest that we approve an AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.  If we have not already, I would not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave will be out of the office December 23, 2000 until Monday, January 8, 2001.  He will be checking his voicemail and will have his cell phone.  The following are the numbers where he can be reached:   December 24  thru December 26 - Saskatoon, SK   (306) 374-9587 or Cell Phone   (713) 907-6315  December 27 thru January 7 - Fairmont, B.C.  (250) 345-4569 or Cell Phone (713) 907-6315    Beverly (x 5-7857) will be available to assist you if you need any help reaching Dave....   Happy Holidays, 
 rick, have a good holiday - John and I appreciate the support you and your group have provided.  regards Delainey 
 Bill, I think you are confusing me with John Lavorato my COO.  I am a University of Saskatchewan grad.  Regardless, if I can help lets discuss in the new year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you put together the folllowing Portfolio/Charter Review for Principal Investing and Energy Capital Resources: a) detail existing portfolio - winners/losers; additions/deletions and overall performance; b) detail market conditions in your markets and any strategy changes following; c) anticipated major transactions in 2001; and d) review charter and detail any proposed changes.  I would anticipate that we sit down with Rick and Jeff at the end of January - please have package available for my review by mid January.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, it will have to wait - I will be back in early January.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to schedule a meeting the you today to discuss HPL...... Would 4:00 pm be ok with all of you....???  please let me know your availability as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI 
 This looks good... all your cc are good and he said to send to all ENA=20 Employees.......  Thanks again for all your help......This will be out tomorrow morning,=20 correct ?????  Thanks,  Kay 
 Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget. My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like #1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end of the scale and early.  Drop me a note on where you end up.  Regards Delainey 
 whats up?  Dave 
 thanks Susan  Regards Delainey 
 John, I need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.  Thanks Dave 
 Barry need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday  Thanks Dave 
 Janet, need 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology for Ben Jacoby and Ed McMichael before Friday - please follow up.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, need your 2000 acoomplishments before Friday.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I need your 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.  Thxs Dave 
 Attached please find the final presentation for the board meeting tommorrow. I assume that RAC will have the resolutions and DASH.  Regards Delainey 
 This should be sent from John and me - Enron Americas, Office of the Chairman to all commercial and support employees in Enron North America.  In addition, copy to Joe Kishkill, Orlando Gonzales, Brett Wiggs and Remi Collognes in Enron South America.  As well, include Jeff Shankman, Mike McConnell, Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen, Louise Kitchen, Phillipe Bibi, Rebecca McDonald, Jim Hughes, Mark Frevert, Greg Whalley.  Please ensure that I am able to proof the final copy before distributing.  I would like to have this by Wednesday night in everyone's e-mail Thursday morning.  Regards Dave 
 Rebecca, lets just go forward with HPL on Thursday - Tex Mex, after going through with the deal team, still has some issues to be resolved.  We will push this into Q1.  The HPL deal is anticipated to be signed on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca. attached you will find the presentation for the HPL deal.  Please forward to Jeff.  If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to give me a call.  Regards Delainey 
 yes thxs dave 
 Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, looks like a good solution - well done.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to October 31,2002.  It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is a breach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30, 2002.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a draft org memo that I anticpate going out on Thursday.  I appreciate your patience.  Please give me any comments ASAP (only major issues).  Brian/Tim, I assume that we need a communication strategy to HPL employees before this memo goes out - please advise.  Please keep this note confidential until release.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, this looks fine.  Regards Delainey 
 As I had indicated before please work through me or Brett - otherwise we risk our ability to move them - please forward appropriately.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, under the assumption that we are not over-paying for the land and that the site has option value beyond the Petrobras deal, I am ok with the purchase.  Regards Delainey 
 Patrick, there are two pages missing (ie) Earnings & ROCE.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I assume you are keeping an eye on "California East".  Any help you can give Kevin would be much appreciated.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you set up some time - perhaps in the new year for a lunch - my office should be fine.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Janet, please have someone draft up a short speech for this function.  Regards Delainey 
 David, good to hear from you - I am sure we will cross paths in your career with Enron.  All the best Delainey

 Angela,  Is Dave supposed to be involved in this ?????  I just happened to be in Dave's email looking for something for him........I saw your name and thought maybe I'd better see if this was something I needed to put on his calendar.....As a rule, I do not go into Dave's  email unless I am told or looking for something that someone has requested me to print and give to him.....so, if you need something to be put on his calendar, please copy me on it or chances are I may or may not find out about it...  Thanks,  Kay

 You guys need to manage this....... 
  Thanks much guys - much appreciate it.  Have a good new year.  Dave 
  Dick, thanks for the e-mail.  I don't think I disagree with any of the points you made and I do think we have come a long way over the last year in the DSM "technology" we employ.  Unfortunately, a lot of these changes in thinking, sales and cost structure are too little too late.  It is highly unlikely at this point that EES will exist beyond next week.  All the best in the future and I would like to personally thank you for your contribution, thought process and caring to the end to make your point.  Regards Delainey 
  fyi 
   Ray, as per your request see attached::  The bottom line we will need approximately $82M for the month of December in order to maintain an asset worth approximately $375M.  The vast majority 80%+ is prepaid energy which will be recovered from the customer.  It is highly likely that we will be able to sell this book. 
 Guys, it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact I had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages, I don't think there any funds to spend.  Perhaps there are empty offices in 3 Allen.  Please look into.  Either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated.  I am waiting for a confidentiality from Calpine and AEP this AM.  Regards Delainey 
  ok to pay 
  Court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business - short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 100 people have at it.  Regards Delainey

  Ray, in EES, the Construction Services (also known as EFS) companies operat= e on a stand alone basis from Enron and have clear liquidation value to the= parents - EES and Enron Corp.  It is my opinion that we should be trying t= o "un-buckle" these companies from Enron over the short term to ensure thei= r continued viablility as we find a sale.  In my view un-buckling means a) = stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up mov= ing cash out of Construction Services up into the parents; b) utilizing tho= se receivables plus, if necessary, Enron's interest in Construction Service= s to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the St. Paul surety bond.  This = surety bond is necessary to continue contracting; and c) terminate the swee= ping of cash from Construction Services bank accounts to Corp immediately. = There will be a meeting early next week with St Paul to renew the surety b= ond.  I am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstat= e the surety bond.  The Construction Services group employs approximately 2= ,600 people and is worth (given current backlog) between $100 and $125 mill= ion dollars.  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 6= 0 to 90 days and we control 100% of the stock of this company.  The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group (also = know as ServiceCo). Again, these companies largely operate independently of= Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron.  Currently, we have o= utside technology and financial partners in the Facility Services Groups th= at make it impossible to factor receivables or move cash out of Facility Se= rvices bank accounts without the approval of the board which includes sever= al outside directors.  We currently own approximately 85% of the firm that = employs approximately 1,400 people and is worth minimum $50 million dollars= (cash value).  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise = dispose over the next 60 to 90 days.  EES also manages several joint ventures (DSM and O&M related mostly) with c= ustomers where we would have to have outside approvals to move cash out of = these entities. These include Owens Corning Energy LLC (Owens Corning), LE = Hesten Energy LLC (Lily), Tenant Services Inc. (Simon Properties), EBC Prop= erty LLC and Enron Distributed Energy Services LLC.  In all cases, we need = to be observant of corporate governance issues with these entities.  As officers, I thought it prudent to ensure that you and your team had all = available information.  I would also like your approval to move forward wit= h my recommendations for the Construction Services group as above.  We appreciate everything you are doing.  Regards Dave Delainey

 guys, please ensure that this is handled.  Regards Delainey 
 Jen, probably done with ENE early in the new year and then determine next steps.  Take care.  Regards Dave 
 Jen, no calls from Sempra - I hear San Diego is nice:)  dave 
  Dan, are you managing or do we need to discuss?  Regards Delainey 
  OK 
 Jimmie, I assume that you and Tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week.  It would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance.  David, we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next Wednesday or Thursday.  Vicki, we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks Judy - you are doing the right things and it is important!  Regards Dave 
 Kay, please set up a meeting to discuss in detail the Lily transaction and next steps - tomorrow or the next day.  Regards Delainey 
 Kalen/Dan, please provide guidance for Scott and let me know.  Scott, we are pretty much in a bind on most of this. I will see what we can do.  Regards Delainey 
 the knuckleheads still rule .... we are still here waiting .....  Dave 
  Mike, I would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services (DSM/O&M) currently provided by EES to Hensen LLC.  Other than a heads up to Jimmie given the potential effects to EBSI, I am assuming that you and Jeremy et al are managing the sale.  Given the amount of work in front of Jimmie around EFS generally (sale of ConstructionCo and restructuring of ServiceCo, I would hope not to overload Jimmie on another sale process.  Thoughts?  Regards Delainey 
 What are we doing with Rexam?  Regards Delainey 
  David, I am ok anytime next Wed or Thursday. Just let Kay know. Thxs  Regards Delainey 
  Jimmie, agree; however, EES cannot immediately convey these agreements to EBSI as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy. Under bankruptcy, we need to show an auction process.  In the cases, where EBSI has contracted directly with the client - I think we are ok.  Vicki please add some texture if required.  Regards Delainey 
  Guys, the plan,as I am currently aware:  a) Gas - as per our conversation this AM - press on; b) Power - start with the California customers post June and the Enron Direct books; c) follow on with the rest of the power book once we are getting traction on (b) above.  Thanks Dave 
 Vicki, I would have Janet, Dan, Jeremy, Scott.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, .... starting to move.. have a few ideas .... the natives are restless... when are you returning to the mother ship?  Regards Delainey 
 Don, can you go through your Canadian gas book and let me know all the positions and customers.  We are planning on putting Enron Energy Services Canada into bankruptcy and need to understand the contracts.  Regards Delainey 
 ok 
 thank you 
  Deborah, I have received your letter dated December 18, 2001 and I will ensure that you get a follow up.  To give you a little texture on the issues, all pre-petition expense statements (Dec 2, 2001) were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid. At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement. This part of the bankruptcy process.  It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.  Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.  Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.  If not please give me a call at 713-853-3829.  Regards Delainey 
 No bid for the barges:)  Better technology in the market regardless of price - these puppies are going to be tough to move.  Regards Delainey 
  Oz, where are you on the WIP DSM "buckets"?  Thxs Dave 
  Wade, you need to give George and Ray more texture ie) we lose $30M in value - in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy Enron ten days with New York ISO.  Been approved by Rogers Herndon (Risk) and Dave Delainey  Regards Delainey

 Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.  Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 2001 plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will be managed.  Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please set up a time for us to speak -- Bruce sorry for the delay - life has been a little hectic.  Don't ever hesitate to call, just have patience.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.  Any summaries on the RTO filings?  Regards Delainey 
 The Strategy Meeting previously scheduled for tomorrow, November 14, 2000, has been cancelled.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay @ 713-853-0643.   Thanks,  Dave 
 Jim, is there executive summaries for the following: a) Eastern Interconnect investigation  by region; and b) RTO's filings.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event.  If you have a different view, lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Thanks Delainey 
 Keep pushing these guys.  Regards Delainey 
 kay, see when this is and if I can go?  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal?  Regards Delainey 
 David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.  If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Are you in? Time is a wasting..... Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of Redmond's group.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.  You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget. Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.  Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.    Regards Delainey 
 Ike, sorry for the delay, it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected.  I have faxed you a proposal.  Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Brian, good memo.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team.  They are being re-deployed out of the upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak with Jean Mrha.  The names include: Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region; Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);  Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region; Gary Bryan - director - east region; Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region; Bill Brogan - manager - east region; Kreg Hall - analyst - east region; Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).  Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given their experience and availability.  Regards Delainey 
 Christi, please provide me with a timeline of when you expect to be filing protests against each utility.  As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I sign off on the filing before it goes out.  Regards

 Guys, great job - the Canadian office is still the model.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, fyi 
 Mark, fyi and between you and I.  Rob will always do the right thing - he is just a little more passionate than the average Enron guy.  Keep trying to build those bridges.  Regards Delainey 
 I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K.  Regards Delainey 
 Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation.  The A&A program is our most important asset.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job guys  - keep it coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control. Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc.  A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.  In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg for mid market and yourself for origination.  I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.  Lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.  Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.  Regards Delainey 
 John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks.  Regards Delainey 
 Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the company we would be a $100 stock.  On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.  I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.  The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness.  The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc.  I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.  I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman.  Let me know your thoughts.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, thanks for the letter on Friday.  The team is preparing an analysis on where we have flexibility and preparing a response.  We should be able to respond before the end of the week.  Thanks Dave Delainey 
 David, i agree in principle with this process.  I assume that you and your team will implement.  Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization.  I would just implement.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity.  I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations.  I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.  The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over the next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Max Yzaguirre.  The e-mail failed.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Scott Josey, John C Thompson and Julie Murray.  I could not find them on e-mail.  Regards Delainey 
 I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.  Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance.  Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.  Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.  Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.  Regards Mark and Dave 
 Guys the PRC has been moved to 11:00.  Regards Delainey 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.   Sincerely,   Dave 
 This is a reminder for you to please take a minute and select your reviewers for the PRC feedback.  Dave is also requesting that you provide a list of accomplishments for the past six (6) months.  Please provide this information to your direct reports as soon as possible.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay  3-0643.   Thanks,  Kay      -
