dall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved. It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.  The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include: a) improving the financial performance of the entity; b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis; c) continue to move from the "heavy lifting" approach to becoming the "smartest pipe" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors (ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.  My time and resources are at your disposal.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, agree with you - why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go through the Regulatory report and iniatives.  Regards Delainey 
 David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign off on the principal investments DASH.  I would like either Bob Virgo or Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:  It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons: a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group; b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.  ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.  Regards Delainey

 Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating. In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.  Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East.  Regards Delainey 
 pls set up 
 ok if Mark is ok.  Regards Delainey 
 You caught us .... 
 Don, NewPort Generation has called me interested in the plants.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI Lets discuss Regards Delainey 
 Mike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this basis.  I assume this keeps my number in and around the $600 to $615MM for the 2000's all in.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please find room 
 Good note - don't think I could do better in style or timing! Regards Delainey 
 Jeff Ader is looking for a reserved parking spot.  He is presently parking on the Blue level and would like to have a reserved spot due to his frequent traveling and customer appointments that warrant his leaving the building, thus loosing his parking space.  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  Regards,  Kay   3-0643 
 Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.  All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities (including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack thereof whichever is applicable.  Regards Delainey 
 Successfully, missed another bullet !!!  I have meetings set up with Mariel= la=20 (the lady you like) and Dan Castingnola, who are the two highest ranked=20 performers in CALME, to see if they are interested in joining our team. =20  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, gas with a $5.00 handle is not a good thing for this deal - I know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can; however, I think we need to determine how to move this faster. Any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Jennifer, is there another time?  Regards Delainey 
 Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.  I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear "title" up front on the new equipment will be important.  However, I will be interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX and increase our operating hours.  I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the next level.  Please stay in contact.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, are you getting all these reports?  Regards Delainey 
 Jen, I would be pleased to attend - sorry for the delay on the e-mail.  Kay, please set up.  Regards Delainey 
 David, how are we making out with this item?  Regards Delainey 
 Carol, I believe Hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group.  Regards Delainey 
 David , if this is going to cause you political flack with Mary Joyce lets just kill it - we have revised the original plan and this is probably not needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the future vision for power and the overall organization including gas mid-market.  Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.  Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.  Regards Delainey 
 As per our discussion. 
 Kay, can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.  We do not currently have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.  However, I do not know what Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME.  Regards Delainey 
 Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.  That process is underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end of this quarter with Charlene on side.  I will discuss with you when I have more details.  Regards Delainey 
 Attorney-Client Protected  Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than our submission.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, it looks like the number is approximately down $198MM.  What is the drill?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, go ahead and set up the meeting.  Delainey 
 Kevin, shouldn't we participate in this RFP? Regards Delainey 
 I don't think we can accomodate that request.  :)  Regards Delainey 
 Don, give Harry some $$'s Regards Delainey 
 Chuck, I appreciate the note - I just like to ensure that everyone is aware of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately.  I have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled.  Regards Delainey 
 It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:  Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other departments Recent successes and current projects Ideas on the horizon Opportunities in your business unit for AA's The benifits of rotation in your business unit An open Q&A session  These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.  Dave 
   The meeting for Friday September 1, 2000 has been cancelled.    This is a reminder !!!!!  There will Not be a Friday Meeting September 1, 2000.    Date:  Friday September 1, 2000   (CANCELLED for this Week)  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location: 30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643) or Bev (3-7857).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable. The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  The benefits include: a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, Capstone and Elektryon; b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications; c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology; and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.  However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.  Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% .  If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting.  Regards Delainey 
 Hey, you guys are copying my model!  Congrats  Regards Delainey 
 Barry, we currently have six folks coming who all golf:  - Barry - Lavo - Delainey - Ozzie - Milly - Yzaguirre  I would say we should golf everday. I will get Kay to forward travel schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much as possible.  My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an additional two weeks starting today.  Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.  Regards Delainey 
 thanks Ray  Delainey 
 Kay, please book 9:00 am to 2:00 pm with me Mike Miller & Don Miller with Mike Childers (Entergy) (actually 10 am to 1pm not including travel time to their shop in the Woodlands) on September 5, 2000.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you come explain some of this to me including where we stand on the GE issues.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, great job - looking for more. Regards Delainey 
 Ben, any thoughts? 
 Rebecca, I am fine with this; however, Lavorato has was spelled wrong.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, are you getting copies of all these reports for the book?  Regards Delainey 
 Adam, thanks for the response, I guess it is a good thing for Enron that we didn't do this deal with TXU.  Nevertheless, I hope that we can find a way through this without significantly impairing value for ENA.  The ENA team will work with you on this item;however, I need your committment to try and keep us whole as much as possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, keep the pressure on these guys; but, I think Adam is in a corner and does not have a lot of flexibility.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, looks fine to me.  Regards Delainey 
 Just a reminder, the East Midstream QBR will be held tomorrow....  DATE:   AUGUST 24, 2000 TIME:    1:00 PM TO 4:00 PM PLACE:   EB 3321 TOPIC:   EAST MIDSTREAM QBR  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact either Kay (3x0643) or Beverly (5x7857).  I will look forward to seeing you there. 
 Steve, I appreciate the offer - I  hope you didn't have to promise your first born since I was basically giving you a hard time.  I may take you up on this next season.  Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team are doing.  Regards Delainey 
 This is the original memo sent to all the committee members from Dave.  I then sent out another one cancelling the Staff Meeting for all those not included in this memo. I also sent out a memo regarding the newly formed ENA Management Committee,  including the assistants,  so everyone would be on board.  Let me know if this isn't what you needed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten.  I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU.  I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy.  I make money you make money.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Regards Delainey 
 Paul, sorry for the delay in responding, I do not have a direct relationship with anyone in Reliant or TXU; however, Jim Ducote and Janet Dietrich may be the best spots in Enron to pursue.  Regards Delainey 
 Adrian, you are very welcome  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, that is correct. See you then Regards Delainey 
 Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.  I will honor our agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent internally and externally to manage this job.  I see very little effort in continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.  Regards Delainey 
 David, I would change John Thompson and Ed Baughman to strong. Thxs Delainey 
 Guys, we need your final review on next years budget (direct expense) for MW Gas (Luce) and LT Gas Fundamentals/Transport Capacity (Gomez) done today.  We are running out of time to finalize the budgeting process.  I would much appreciate your assistance.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, where are we on gas interconnect?   I am hearing rumblings of 15 year Kern exposure - don't  know if I like that.  Regards Delainey

 Dave has reserved a Plane to take all of you to Las Vegas for the Offsite, December 13th.  We have no idea  what time the PRC will be over; however, at the conclusion of the PRC everyone should plan to go straight to the Hanger to board the aircraft.  I just got confirmation last night that I have the plane, so I really don't have any details at this point.  As soon as I get the information, I will make packets for each of you with directions to the hanger.  We are asking that you make your own reservations for the return since everyone will be leaving at different times.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.  Thanks,  Kay  3-0643 
 Ben, can you spend a little time and give me some feedback on this item.  Regards Delainey

 Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.  They should be actively managing and monitoring ENA's piece.  Regards Delainey 
 John, if we invite Scott then I think we have to add Eric Thode(PR/IR); however, everyone would be in!!  What do you think?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you make sure I am available 
 This is it.  So sorry I left you name off.  Kay 
 Staff & Budget Meeting has been cancelled.  Please make a note on your calendars. A new committee has been formed "ENA Management Committee".  A memo will be going out with the attendees and with the times.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.   Thanks,  Kay

 Mark, this is great - giving the increased exposure/politics in some of these markets it makes a lot of sense.  Regards Delainey 
 As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday.  Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, I am in favour.  Regards Delainey 
 Wayne, that would be fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Please note time change for the QBR to be held on Friday, August 18th.  It will be from 8:30 am to 11:30 am so that we can have the Friday afternoon budget and staff meeting.  The QBR will be held in EB3321.  Thanks. 
 Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.  We need to bring more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to evaluate future leaders.  Trading   Origination  Country Managers  Support   Executive  Belden    Dietrich   Milnthorp   Colwell    Frevert Presto    Calger   Yzaguirre   Beck    Delainey Arnold    Duran       Oxley    Lavorato Neal    Bowen       Haedicke Shively    Donahue      Murray Allen    Mrha Martin    Redmond  I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.  Look forward to your comments.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.  It is not a bad model just a different one.  Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any thoughts - do we have excess development staff - this would be a good opportunity for the brave at heart.  Regards Delainey 
 Just a reminder.....West Mid Market QBR will be held this week:  DATE:   FRIDAY, AUGUST 18, 2000 TIME:   1:00 PM TO 4:00 PM PLACE:   EB3321  I will look forward to seeing you there.
