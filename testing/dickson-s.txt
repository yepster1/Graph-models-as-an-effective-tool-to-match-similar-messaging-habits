 Mr Porter:  Per the request of Cary Carrabine, attached please find my review of the credit that you proposed to add to the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement. Please call me with your comments at (713) 853-5705.  Sincerely,  Stacy Dickson 
 Heather,  I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o.k.  We did not have any problems. Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of days off.  Stacy  P.S. I heard that Monica Jordan Richards left Enron and went to Entergy. 
 Gregg,  As we discussed... I would add the following provision at the end of the second sentence in Section VIII A. (3):  ;provided however, in the event that Seller's invoice to Buyer is delayed due to Buyer not providing Seller the ANR information in the time period specified in Section V (2), the due date for payment of the Demand Charge shall be the twenty fifth (25th) day following the service month.   Stacy 
 Susan,  I just returned from a four month maternity leave.  I have not seen executed documents.  Attached are the final version of the documents on the system.  I will track down the signed versions (if they were returned by EOTT during my absence) and send you copies.  Stacy 
 Cary,  Jeff gave me the Conoco agreements to work on.  Unfortunately, I do not remember what he says needs to be done.  Do you recall where we stand with them?  Stacy 
 Ellen,  I did not do this deal.  Stacy 
 Do you still need me to modify the PG&E amendment?  If so, please forward it to me.  Stacy 
 Mr. Porter:  Per the request of Cary Carrabine, attached please find an executable version of the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between enovate, L.L.C. and Hess Energy Services, L.L.C.  Also attached is a redlined version of the Agreement which shows your changes that I have incorporated.  If everything is satisfactory, please print two copies of the executable agreement and secure signature on behalf of Hess Energy Services.  Please fax a copy of the partially-executed agreement to Cary and mail the originals to him.  We will send you a fully-executed original for your files.  Should you have any questions, feel free to contact me at (713) 853-5707.  Stacy Dickson 
 Cary,  Attached are executable GISB and Master Firm agreements for Conoco which incorporate Conoco's comments.  Stacy 
 Susan,  I left a message last week for Brenda Frankenhauser about the Columbia assignment.  She has not returned my call.  Stacy 
 Susan,  Please use the new master instead of the old GISB.  Stacy 
 Thanks for the info. 
 Yes. 
 Donna:  Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail.  ENA does use the GISB contract to conduct its "spot" business.  By "spot", I mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less in duration.  Enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use.  I have attached a copy of that agreement.  We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.  Our current version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreement that is attached.  I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is.  We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in duration.  For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that I have attached.  If you need copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Ellen Wallumrod would be able to give you examples.  Form confirmations are at the back of each of the agreements attached.  If you need additional information, please let me know.   Stacy Dickson x3-5705 
 Gregg,  Attached are my suggested changes to the above-referenced confidentiality agreement.  One of the changes was to address the enovate employee issue that we discussed.  A few of the changes are simply clean-up.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Stacy 
 Thanks 
 Gregg,  I am open tomorrow except for between 11:30 and 1:00.  Let me know what you schedule.  Stacy 
 Gregg,  Sounds  good.  I will wait for your
