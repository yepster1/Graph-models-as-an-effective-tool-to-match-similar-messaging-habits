nts (ultimately, this is a business decision)  and 2) I would tell them that we need arbitration.  In some respects, it is more likely that disputes would arise under this type of deal so it is even more important to have arbitration. Please let me know if you want me to talk to anyone at Allegheny about their changes.  Stacy 
 Per our conversation. 
 Paul,  Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.  There was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).  I have also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for April.  Please review and give me your comments.  Stacy 
 Your brain is working correctly.  I think that we should seek out and destroy  every old Seagull contract.  If we are doing business under any of them, we need to get new cotnracts in place.  Stacy 
 Jennifer,  What a cutie!  Meg is adorable and so grown up now!  She should start talking before long if she has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching her to say Stacy.  I hope you guys are doing well.  I understand Mr Espey is not doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you guys since you are not near by.  When do you think that you will be in Houston again?  We miss you guys.  We got used to your being around last year.  Meredith is doing well.  She is starting to sit well on her own.  She still does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes her mad when she does.  She loves her exersaucer.  We went to Arkansas for Easter so Meredith had her first plane ride.  She did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal yet.  We only feed her twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that she will still be on formula when she goes to kindergarden!  I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.  Stacy 
 Sara,  Number 3 concerns the swap piece of this deal.  Stacy 
 Sounds good.  I will look for the overnight. 
 Paul,  Attached is the final version of the Master Firm Agreement which incorporates NUI's notice information and all previously discussed changes.  Also, attached is the April Transaction Confirmation Letter with the change to the addressee.  The Exhibits for the letter are the NUI Confirmations Nos. 31060 and 46669.  I understand that the changes that you requested to the swap guaranty are acceptable and that you will receive revised agreements shortly.  Please let me know if there is anything else outstanding.  Stacy 
 Stacey,  I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.  Thank you,  Stacy Dickson Granmayeh
