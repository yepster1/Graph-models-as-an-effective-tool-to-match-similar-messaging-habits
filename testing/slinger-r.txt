 There were some schedule changes to april and may due to some training classes on the last weeekend in April.  If anyone has conflicts let me know or trade where possible.  ryan 
 I designed a slightly different el paso model and it is in the Jan 02 el paso folder under Test El Paso Model.  The differences are just getting rid of the PX junk and adding in places to copy in the dispatch info(notes and proposed buy/sale decisions).  It should make it easier for the person on the following day shift to make a good hand off and evening peak decision.  If you have any ideas or want to design a new preschedule tab or anything else that would be cool.  ryan 
 I did some "off-inc sheet deals" today and they can be found in Nov Slinger cali trading in the Inc sheet folder.  Please include these in the SAR when it is run.   thanks,  ryan 
 We are long 10mw SP15 from the APX for HE 1-10 at a price of $15.  EES is short so you should be able to offset the two.  The deal is not in Caps or Enpower.  thanks,  ryan
