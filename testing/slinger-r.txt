 Please include my name on the list of interested people.  Thank You,  ryan 
 Just a reminder that we really need to keep in contact with CERS on the off peak as they are beginning to buy more on more from us on-peak.  We still need to net out with them each month so any purchasing from them will greatly help us on the day shift.  thanks,  ryan 
 We sold 3mw of NP15 to "SIERRA PACIFIC HOLDING" for friday 11/09/01.  The price is 34 dollars and it is not in enpower or caps as of yet.  thanks,  ryan 
 Susan, the Real Time desk is trying to save a import schedule and we got this error. Any ideas? The deal was created in FSP, all appropriate fields are population.

 I bought 8mw of SP15 from Gas recovery systems and built the purchase in CAPS with the APX.   It is 8mw HE 9-17 @29 dollars.  We also had Arco come back up and they need to be sold or used to cover a short, it is 26 mw in SP15 and the gen schedule is already built in CAPS for 10/24 and 10/25.  They are up around the clock and need to recieve fair market price for their generation. 
 Enpower to Caps is going to be out for HE 15.  We sold 25mw to Allegheny in SP however IT has not yet built an APX5 counterparty in caps so I put it in APX1 and then changed the template to send it and balance.  thanks,  ryan 
 The fees that we charge for marketing EES has been revised and will take effect 10/4/01.  The new fees are as follows:  1-100mw's=$3 fee 100-200mw's=$4 fee over 200mw=$5 fee  Please note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.  Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.  In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.  thanks,  ryan 
 AFTER TALKING TO KATE HERE I WAS MADE AWARE THAT SOME DEALS WERE ZEROED OUT IN "DEAL SCHEDULING" FOR THAT DAY.  CONSTELLATION IS CORRECT THOUGH, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 25MW AT 40 DOLLARS.  THANKS,  RYAN 
 ACCORDING TO ENPOWER THIS DEAL WAS DONE ON ENRON ONLINE, AND IT DOES HAVE 25MW AT $40 IN THE DEAL.  THE WAY IT READS OVER HERE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISPUTE.  IF I AM READING THIS INCORRECTLY LET ME KNOW.  THANKS,  RYAN 
 The following are the basics on what I was proposing on hourly call/put options:  1.  Structure: a. Delivery Point: NP15 or SP15 b. Strike Price: determined at time of purchase or sale c.

 We had some problems scheduling ARCO as the ISO had a 10.8 mw curtailment scheduled for ARCO through HE 24 for 8/1/01.  In order to schedule the extra 6mw for 8/1/01 I had to change that outage and set the curtailment at 5mw and that is scheduled through 9/1/01.  The ISO had two separate outage schedules and I said to just go with the 5mw curtailment until you guys could get back with them on the exact outage.  Thanks,  ryan 
 It appears that there is a 10mw transmission schedule missing on peak from Pac System border to Mid C.  This has us out 320 mw at Mid C for 8/1/01.  thanks- ryan 
 Somehow it seems everyone ends up in portland...just was flipping through web pages and ran across your listing on the david douglas site.  Hope everything is going well.  ryan 
 I had to change your august schedule since I misread leaf's vacation request.  The way I have it now is four night shifts in a row from the 8th through the eleventh.  This shouldn't be too bad since you have seven nights off prior to the schedule.  I couldn't figure out any other way to do it, while keeping everyone else's requests whole.  If you would rather break up your six day then give me a call and I will make the adjustments.  thanks,  ryan 
 1.  When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.  2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier. 
 Anytime on the 10th of July works for me.  Thanks,  Ryan 
 There is no enpower to CAPS for 6/21 since the ISO computers went down and they do not have any finals for HE 21.  They said that some time around noon today they will try to repost the data after their guys recover it from the down servers.  Somebody in Houston or here may be able to just make the preferred the final for that hour, however this is something that I never learned how to do so I am going to have to pass on doing that.  thanks,  ryan 
 Either the 5th or the 6th will work, I will be out of the office but can stop by to do the interview.  thanks,  ryan 
 As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.  1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T) 2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T) 3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T) 4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T) 5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.  I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.   Enjoy,  Slinger 
 Hey, good to hear from you.  All is going well here.  I'm still with Enron for a few days.  Our division just got bought out by the Union Bank of Switzerland, or better known as UBS.  I guess things didn't work out so well for most with the company, but what are you gonna do.  Right now it's 6am and I am the only one here.  About 75% of our portland office got laid off.  I'm in early to read my new contract with UBS, I think I'm going to sign it which means I'll be here for another year at least.  I should end up getting a new UBS email address soon, also my hotmail account is a good address, rmsling@hotmail.com	So when are you up in Portland?  It was two years ago january since I've seen you!  Hope everthing is going well.  ryan 
 On sunday we had a problem with PSCO, they tried to back out of a purchase from El Paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.  thanks,  ryan

 I know your ad said that you wouldn't reply to anything without a picture but I'm not really computer literate yet and I thought your posting was interesting.  Energy law is a hobby for me right now since I'm an electricity trader for Enron.  Anyway, I'm not really looking for anything more than to meet some new people.  Hanging around traders all the time gets a little out of control and leads to meeting the wrong girls.  If you want to email let me know.  ryan 
 HE 7-22 realtime is buying 25mw from Harbor at a price of $175 
   Please find the enclosed El Paso Model.  If you have any questions regarding the model please call Steve or Eric.  They will be able to contact me to answer your questions.  Regards,  Bert Meyers 
 THE NEW SCHEDULE IS OUT FOR JUNE, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE IRREGULARITY.  THERE WERE MANY REQUESTS FOR DAYS OFF AND IF I DID NOT ACCOMODATE YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  SLINGER 
 PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WITH DEAL ENTRY, EXTENDING DEALS, BROKER FEES AND KEEPING STRAIGHT WHICH BOOK YOU ARE DOING THE DEAL UNDER.  THESE ARE ALL PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WHEN RUNNING THE SAR TONIGHT IN A ADDITION TO MPC DEALS NOT BEING IN THE SHEET, AS I TALKED TO YOU GUYS ABOUT THAT EARLIER.  PLEASE SORT THE SERVICES AND INC SHEET EITHER BY DEAL, SOURCE OR SINK.  JUST LUMPING IT ALL TOGETHER IN AN ENDLESS STRING OF DEALS IS LIKE PLAYING 52 CARD PICK UP WHEN THERE ARE MISTAKES IN MANY OF THE DEALS. 
 FOR HE 11  5/13/01, I CUT A 50MW WHEEL REALTIME FROM MALIN/MEAD230.  RYAN SLINGER 
 For HE 21&22 of 5/4/01 18mw was cut to a zero  For HE 24&1 of 5/4-5 10mw was cut to a zero  ryan slinger 
 There were some schedule changes to april and may due to some training classes on the last weeekend in April.  If anyone has conflicts let me know or trade where possible.  ryan 
 I designed a slightly different el paso model and it is in the Jan 02 el paso folder under Test El Paso Model.  The differences are just getting rid of the PX junk and adding in places to copy in the dispatch info(notes and proposed buy/sale decisions).  It should make it easier for the person on the following day shift to make a good hand off and evening peak decision.  If you have any ideas or want to design a new preschedule tab or anything else that would be cool.  ryan 
 I did some "off-inc sheet deals" today and they can be found in Nov Slinger cali trading in the Inc sheet folder.  Please include these in the SAR when it is run.   thanks,  ryan 
 We are long 10mw SP15 from the APX for HE 1-10 at a price of $15.  EES is short so you should be able to offset the two.  The deal is not in Caps or Enpower.  thanks,  ryan
