picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.  thanks,  ryan

 I know your ad said that you wouldn't reply to anything without a picture but I'm not really computer literate yet and I thought your posting was interesting.  Energy law is a hobby for me right now since I'm an electricity trader for Enron.  Anyway, I'm not really looking for anything more than to meet some new people.  Hanging around traders all the time gets a little out of control and leads to meeting the wrong girls.  If you want to email let me know.  ryan 
 HE 7-22 realtime is buying 25mw from Harbor at a price of $175 
   Please find the enclosed El Paso Model.  If you have any questions regarding the model please call Steve or Eric.  They will be able to contact me to answer your questions.  Regards,  Bert Meyers 
 THE NEW SCHEDULE IS OUT FOR JUNE, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE IRREGULARITY.  THERE WERE MANY REQUESTS FOR DAYS OFF AND IF I DID NOT ACCOMODATE YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  SLINGER 
 PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WITH DEAL ENTRY, EXTENDING DEALS, BROKER FEES AND KEEPING STRAIGHT WHICH BOOK YOU ARE DOING THE DEAL UNDER.  THESE ARE ALL PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WHEN RUNNING THE SAR TONIGHT IN A ADDITION TO MPC DEALS NOT BEING IN THE SHEET, AS I TALKED TO YOU GUYS ABOUT THAT EARLIER.  PLEASE SORT THE SERVICES AND INC SHEET EITHER BY DEAL, SOURCE OR SINK.  JUST LUMPING IT ALL TOGETHER IN AN ENDLESS STRING OF DEALS IS LIKE PLAYING 52 CARD PICK UP WHEN THERE ARE MISTAKES IN MANY OF THE DEALS.

 There were some schedule changes to april and may due to some training classes on the last weeekend in April.  If anyone has conflicts let me know or trade where possible.  ryan 
 I designed a slightly different el paso model and it is in the Jan 02 el paso folder under Test El Paso Model.  The differences are just getting rid of the PX junk and adding in places to copy in the dispatch info(notes and proposed buy/sale decisions).  It should make it easier for the person on the following day shift to make a good hand off and evening peak decision.  If you have any ideas or want to design a new preschedule tab or anything else that would be cool.  ryan 
 I did some "off-inc sheet deals" today and they can be found in Nov Slinger cali trading in the Inc sheet folder.  Please include these in the SAR when it is run.   thanks,  ryan 
 We are long 10mw SP15 from the APX for HE 1-10 at a price of $15.  EES is short so you should be able to offset the two.  The deal is not in Caps or Enpower.  thanks,  ryan
