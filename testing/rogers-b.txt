 Things are going well here in the States.  Work is very busy right now and i am actually training to  do the MS 150 Bike race.  It a race from Houston to Austin.  It's a 170 mile, two day ride with about 5,000 bikers.  It's on April 16th and 17th.  I rode this weekend only 40 miles.  Yes I am going todo the NYC Marathon and for you virgins, I will kick your fat asses.  Darnit, I wanted a pet Camel for our apartment.  Yes I got your message last week - I had just stepped away from my desk and just missed you.  When do you get back?  Sometime in the Summer.  By the summer I hope to be in the 185 range, currently I'm right at 200!!!  Not very good.  I have been talking with Mike Gioffre lately and were trying to get people together this spring or summer. I'll let you know when.  Gotta go, but I'll talk to you soon. Ben 
 Meg: I was wondering if you are able to give me an idea of when I would hear from the Admissions Office.  My application has been with the office since Jan. 21st.  UT is my first choice and I am very interested to hear form the School.  Thank you for your help and hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks! Ben 
 I talked to Bruce on Friday around 5:00pm and they are getting us, as well as Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday.  Nepco will take till the following Monday to turn the doc. around.  I told him we need it sooner than that, but he seems to think that is the standard time of return.  We need to find out from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc.  We will meet with Bruce on Wednesday.  We also may want to think about going up there with an Engineer to visit the site.  We can talk more on Monday. Ben

 Here is a presentation I need by 12:00 this morning.  I need 1 set of transparencies and 40 color copies, where these copies are stapled and three-holed punched at the top.

Please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks Ben 3-7998 
 Meeting with Carl Livermore from structuring on Monday afternoon at 1:00 down on 29 at Carl's desk.  We will be discussing the synthetic CC structure.  Ben 3-7998 
 It would be a trading/marketing power position.  My goal is to understand power markets in detail and this would be a way to do just that.  My # is 713-853-7998. 
 I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating #'s and cost numbers as well.  When I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that these are not "normal" operating assumptions.  Please give me a call if you have any questions. Ben 
 Here you go!  Let me know if you need anything else. Ben 
 Please use the Transco Zone 6 NON New York curve for the transaction we were talking about for Don Black. Thanks Ben 3-7998

 Good Afternoon!  If your able to get a total of 4 tickets to the game that would be great.  Thanks for your help with this matter. Ben 
 Wanted to see how the meeting with Don Black went regarding the "retail shorts" on Friday.  Lets catch up on the other deals. Thanks Ben 
 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the many people I talked with at the Texas B-School. Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in Texas, such as myself.  Regards,  Ben Rogers 
 It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time wh can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon. Ben 
 I talked to Mary Lou on Thursday afternoon and she said that we were all set with tickets (6) in the box seats.  Does this sound correct?  Thanks for your help in getting these tickets.  Hope you had a good weekend. Ben 
 I will let you know by tomorrow what the exact times of the games begin on Saturday so when can fly in on Sat.  We ended up working around the apartment and getting things in order.  Pretty boring but nice.  I ran this morning and played outdoor b-ball, it was really nice outside.  Hope we can get together soon b/c it was good to see you and Susan for dinner last week.  Talk to you this week. Ben 
 Here is the most recent copy of the presentations.  Don - please call Jinsung if you need any changes.  I will be in on Monday, so leave me a message if you need something for the beginning of next week.  Thanks Ben

 Here is a copy of the flow of funds for the Teco Project.  Please give Don Black a call if you have any questions.  Thanks Ben

I am trying to get two tickets for you and your Dad.  I think my dad and I are going and a buddy of mine and his dad.  It will be a lot of fun.  Let me know where you guys will be flying into and where you might stay.  See ya Ben 
 I actually just talked to Mary Lou this morning, because my dad e-mailed me this morning to get 6 tickets for the Final Four for both Saturday and Sunday (April 1st and 3rd).  Thanks for the e-mail. Ben

My afternoon (1:00-5:00) is full with a information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) and an Admissions interview.  I would appreciate it if you could send me your office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me.  Look forward to meeting you.  Ben Rogers

 Mike: Just wanted to let you know how everything went with the Marathon if you haven't heard already.  My time was a little slower (4:27: 53), but I finished and my goal of not walking was kept.  I now want you to focus in on is the MS150 in April.  We are both doing it and yes, I will give you your bike back to do it.

 Here is some information that will be of use to you.  Please give me a call Wednesday or Thursday to talk about meeting on Friday.  See ya. Ben 
 Rodney: Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the entire reg.risk process.  For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust the reg.risk book.  I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them. I was in yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not come up  with them.  In rotating down to East Orig. I lost a box of stuff, but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the case.  Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point.  Again, sorry for the delay.  Ben 3-7998

Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine. Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks Ben

 This is the model from KN regarding their 4 LM 6000 Plant and their other plant which has 6 LM 6000's and I EA.

 Mr. Pushaw: Whats up my friend.  It's been a long while-too long.  The last time I saw you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian rest.  I've been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout.  How's everything at law school going?  Will you be staying in NYC after you graduate?  I may be in NYC next year going to B-School at Columbia.  I'm down here in Houston working with Enron.  It's been a great experience but I'm ready to go back to school to get my MBA.  Please give me a call when you have some time and lets catch up.  My work number is (713)853-7998 and home is (713) 355-8738.  Hope all is going well and talk to you soon.  See ya Ben

 We and my family are going to Beaver Creek for x-mas but are going on a cruise which travels to different Virgin islands and will be in St. Barts for New Years.  We have never been to these Islands or on a cruise before so it should be pretty interesting.  I'll let you know about the tics.  See ya Ben 
 Hey Mike, Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding? Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you and your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that is Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending the New Year?  Talk to you later. Ben 
 No, but thanks for the offer. Ben 
 Here is the model that Delmarva sent to us, which needs to be run through a WinZip file.  You may want to check it against the previous model they sent to us to see what has changed.  I will be putting together questions on the model they sent over.  Let me know when you would like to sit down and go through them.  Bruce - you may want to go through it to check the O&M assumptions.  Bruce, if you have any questions please give myself or Erin Norris a call. Thanks Ben
