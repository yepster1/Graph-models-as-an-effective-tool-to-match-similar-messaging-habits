If you could send me a list of the e-mails you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks for the help and lets talk about this further.  Talk to you soon. Ben

 Amy: Here are my answers  to your questions: 1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide audience with this advertisement. 2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get an even wider reach of potential candidates. 3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that people would take it seriously to try and win the cash. 4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way. Thanks Ben Rogers 3-7998

 Dr. Ueng: I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.  Regards, Ben Rogers 713-853-7998
