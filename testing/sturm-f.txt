ould just like to be taken off the global e-mail distribution.  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm Enron 
 Sheri,  Robyn Menear is my new assistant on the FT-Central book.  I'd like to have her set up to use EOL stack manager, product manager, and transact on the website.  I believe she already has a login ID for the website, but I don't know about the others.  In addition, her trades (stack manager customer trades, and her own website trades) need to go into my book (FT-Central).  If you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen, let me know.  Thanks,  Fletcher Sturm x36219 
 Melba,  The description you sent to me yesterday seems a little confusing...How about the following:  Floating price A: Gas Daily midpoint for Henry Hub  Floating price B: Gas Daily midpoint for __________  Buyer pays Floating price A plus applicable basis, seller pays Floating price B   We should substitute your long description for "Gas Daily midpoint" above. Run this by everyone ASAP so we can activate these products.  Fletch Sturm x3-6219 
 NatGas is going to the moon on Monday!  Fletcj 
 Douglas,  Thanks for your interest...My book does go into some option detail (not really collars since they're a combination of the tools I discuss) and plenty of swap transactions.  Obviously, I think you would gain some insight for both your personal and professional interests if you go through it.  Thanks again,  Fletcher Sturm 
 we're ok for now...thanks for checking  fletch 
 thanks for the note!  we're doing fine and trying to get some sleep here and there...i'll e-mail pic's to you...take care.  fletch 
 Please put this on my calander for Wed (5/3) at 3:30 in 30C1.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 that's not our house for sale yet, but probably in the next 6 months or so...not in a hurry as it feels like real estate market cooling off somewhat.  thanks.  Fletch 
 Greg,  Check out a company called Opus 360 for recruiting IT people (www.opus360.com).  It might be a good investment for the equity group too (OPUS).  Fletch 
 Sorry, just read this e-mail and don't think I did the trade you are referring to.  Let me know.  Fletch 
 Greg,  I've been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from EOL.  I've used this to build a real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas locations, including variable cost analysis, NPV, etc.  I think that this would be an extremely useful application to include on the EOL site, whether it is in Excel format or some homemade format.  For example, Hunter and I were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk components of their PBR.  We brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc.  If we can develop an EOL - dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors.  Let me know what you think!  Fletch 
 Congratulations Dave!  You're the king!  Fletch 
 thanks Coi  Fletch 
 brenda,  could you re-send to everyone and ask them to bring a copy of their one-month and summer basis positions?  thanks,  fletch 
 Kevin,  Don't forget about us down here in the dusty old gas trading business!  Congratulations,  Fletch 
 that won't be a problem at all ily fletch

 Hey,  Sorry I haven't read my e-mail in the past day and a half (too busy selling), but that sounds good.  Fletch 
 I'll need to go another time...already have a meeting.  I definitely want to see the demo.  Fletch 
 Jeff,  Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have time(?).  I just wanted to brief you first.  I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meetings.  This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone's mind.  Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in basis until 8:30?  I think it would be worth it. I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups (origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's basis positions.  Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions? Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured positions?  I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being "cluttered up" in different books (i.e.  the P/L from these trades would be my focus instead of managed by other traders.) Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me?  It seems like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.  Talk to you soon,  Fletch 
 yes, that's fine  Fletch 
 Louise,  Yes, I'd like to get together as soon as possible.  I'm available this afternoon (Fri) or Tues. next week in the afternoon.  Let me know.  Fletch 
 Louise,  I mentioned an idea to Jeff Shankman the other day about providing some charting and other types of tools to EOL users and he asked me to get with you.  He said you were already working on some additions to the website.  I would really like to participate in the development of these tools, so please let me know when I can get with you and discuss my ideas.  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm 
 Sally,  Congratulations on your promotion!  Good luck with everything.  Fletch Sturm 
 We're still working on it for you!  I'll keep you updated as I know more.  Fletch 
 I appreciate it!  Hope all is well with you...we're doing fine now that the flu made its way through our house.  Fletch 
 yes, that will work.  thanks  fletch 
 No thanks, but I did pick up a pre-owned Jaguar...sweet!  Congrats to you too.  Hope to see you out again soon...Thanks again for your help with Coal info.  Fletch

 are spouses invited? 
 John,  Per Kevin, we've already sent our requests.  Fletch 
 Phil,  I don't have any specific recommendations, but I think PennWell Books has the best selection of all books on the subject.  Thanks for your interest,  Fletch Sturm 
 Scott,  Please take me off the e-mail distribution list...I receive the charts, etc. from others here.  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm Enron 
 yeah man, it's going great...how are things with you?  fletch
