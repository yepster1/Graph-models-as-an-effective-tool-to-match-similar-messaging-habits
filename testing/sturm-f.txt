 moon on Monday!  Fletcj 
 Douglas,  Thanks for your interest...My book does go into some option detail (not really collars since they're a combination of the tools I discuss) and plenty of swap transactions.  Obviously, I think you would gain some insight for both your personal and professional interests if you go through it.  Thanks again,  Fletcher Sturm 
 we're ok for now...thanks for checking  fletch 
 thanks for the note!  we're doing fine and trying to get some sleep here and there...i'll e-mail pic's to you...take care.  fletch 
 Please put this on my calander for Wed (5/3) at 3:30 in 30C1.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 that's not our house for sale yet, but probably in the next 6 months or so...not in a hurry as it feels like real estate market cooling off somewhat.  thanks.  Fletch 
 Greg,  Check out a company called Opus 360 for recruiting IT people (www.opus360.com).  It might be a good investment for the equity group too (OPUS).  Fletch 
 Sorry, just read this e-mail and don't think I did the trade you are referring to.  Let me know.  Fletch 
 Greg,  I've been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from EOL.  I've used this to build a real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas locations, including variable cost analysis, NPV, etc.  I think that this would be an extremely useful application to include on the EOL site, whether it is in Excel format or some homemade format.  For example, Hunter and I were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk components of their PBR.  We brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc.  If we can develop an EOL - dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors.  Let me know what you think!  Fletch 
 Congratulations Dave!  You're the king!  Fletch 
 thanks Coi  Fletch 
 brenda,  could you re-send to everyone and ask them to bring a copy of their one-month and summer basis positions?  thanks,  fletch 
 Kevin,  Don't forget about us down here in the dusty old gas trading business!  Congratulations,  Fletch

 Hey,  Sorry I haven't read my e-mail in the past day and a half (too busy selling), but that sounds good.  Fletch 
 I'll need to go another time...already have a meeting.  I definitely want to see the demo.  Fletch 
 Jeff,  Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have time(?).  I just wanted to brief you first.  I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meetings.  This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone's mind.  Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in basis until 8:30?  I think it would be worth it. I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups (origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's basis positions.  Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions? Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured positions?  I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being "cluttered up" in different books (i.e
