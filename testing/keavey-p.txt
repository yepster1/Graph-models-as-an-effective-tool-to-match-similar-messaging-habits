et.  Many of our customers and competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  Deal Flow  As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market. 
 The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for existing products in the next few weeks. The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some work. I should have a list of new locations shortly.  Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things happen.  Thanks,  Pete

 oh how the truth hurts. As a Texas resident i can tell you that Bush is by far the worse of these two evils.  Never has a more expensive suit been filled by such cheap intellect (or lack thereof).  But as usual whoever is elected will make no difference anyway. 
 Colleen,  It is AGA day could we change the time?
