 The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for existing products in the next few weeks. The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some work. I should have a list of new locations shortly.  Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things happen.  Thanks,  Pete

 Hi Al,  I got the email.  We didn't have any flight  plans made yet anyway.  The bachelor party sounds like it will be fun as long as us married guys can get away. I haven't been to Vegas ever so that would be fun for me.  We should stay at the Belagio if it is available for a decent price.  August is offseason in Vegas right??   Those party  days are too far behind me to remember right now.  I need a weekend away so I can get some  sleep.  If you want to feel your age just get a few kids and get no sleep for a few months.  You have the right address for me but it isn't in an Italian neighborhood we don't allow any down here.  Remember that the Baptism for Caroline  is Saturday August 4th  in NJ. We are having a dinner after at a place nearby the church I hope you both can make it.  It should be at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  Talk to you soon  Pete 
 ok ,let me know where and when 
 The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  What should the consistent market convention for determining the first tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second. This will present consistency problems if we are trading near pa
