 i don't think our rosters have a good trade match because i'm sure you are not ready to deal Davis and Robinson. Ricky was my # 1 pick for a reason and Warrick is the only decent receiver in Cin.  the two guys you are offering are not top players. 
 Rickey is always available for the right price  i would need a starting WR for him though as part of the package

 Richard,  After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of $604,000.  You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  Call me to go over the numbers if you want  Pete
