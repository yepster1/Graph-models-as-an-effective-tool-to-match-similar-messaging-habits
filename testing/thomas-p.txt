 I do not think it was a price revision, hence I would like to see all the deals from the last half of the month.  I think some deals might have entered into the system incorrectly.  I will contact Warrick to see what deals he shows in the system.  Paul

 Virtual Bidding Questions  1)	How is uplift allocated when there is thunderstorm alert in NYC?  Is the uplift allocated to those short going into the real time in Zone J/K only or is it allocated statewide? 2)	When is uplift allocated statewide as opposed to superzone? 3)	Are credit amounts going to be adjusted and when?  Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure.  Thanks Tom
