o take a trip there.  It is different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome, London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!!   Take care and have a great Christmas.  Paul

 While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.  If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.  If you have any questions please let me know.  I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.  Paul
