He is going to serve dinner and have beer.  Sounds like a good party to me   I will give you a call today.  Later PT 
 The pictures are great!  Thanks, Paul 
 Sorry.. I sent it but the file is too big..  You can find it @ M:/power2/analyst/PJM/NYISO Map.ppt(close to that name)  It should be the only powerpoint file in there. Paul 
 Hey Cory.. can you send me the heat rate calculator.  Thanks. Paul 
 Homemade.. you need to check the numbers 
  I think that I will be leaving soon.. I hope to be outta here by 4:15!  Love Ya ME 
 Gary,  We spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open.  Currently, I am making markets on Enron Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market.  In addition, I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast (PJM, NYISO, and NEPOOL) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk.  I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at Enron. The opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the Houston area.  My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida.  I look forward to talking to you soon.  Paul D. Thomas East Power Trading (713) 853-0403 
 Hey bundalicious!  How are you doing?  We only have one more day to go before the holiday.  I can't wait to spend the week with you!  I wanted to get you dad's email address.  Love ME 
 David,  Diana Allen and the IT team are currently working on resovling the bad Zone P day ahead and real time data.  Diana told me that it was pulling the PJM data.  As far as the shift notes go: I talked to Rob Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly.  The PJM summary page is pretty accurate (usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number).  The link for the spreadsheet is:  http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/summary/pjmsummary.aspx  .. you might have been using an old version.  I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book.  It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market.  Paul.  While writing the e-mail Diana said that she fixed the Zone P problem. 
 Peterman, DP&L called.. they are having trouble checking out a deal from October 5th.  They sounded all twisted off so I told them that you would call them Monday..  The guys name is Dave Antonides @ 937-331-4576 
 Brain, I need to you to purchase Oasis for me for Friday, Sat, Sun, and Monday.  I am unable to do it because it must be done the day b4... so tomorrow (Thurs) I will need to buy Fri Oasis.. Friday you will be able to buy Oasis for Sat, Sun and Monday.  The ramp is set and you will need to see what gets accepted on the NY side to make sure the ramp matches the volumes accepted in NY.   --- The PJM ID # is N78958 << this is the PJM schedule where the ramp and Oasis needs to be purchased. --- The NY ID # is 5039123 << this is NY schedule that is flowing.  --- PJM will ask you if NY IS # 5043451 is flowing? The answer is no.  Give me a call so I can walk you through it the first time Home 713-664-2178 Cell   281-787-0713

 Jiewen and Mark,  I am sure I do not understand the basis for the information but two reports seem to contradict.  The PJM 180 day forecast predicts 4000MW offline today. <http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=8&title=PJM%20Generation%20Outages&url=/Cooper/PJMOutage.asp>  The PJM outage report predicts 1908 MW offline. <http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=8&url=http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/scripts/outage.dll?REGION=MAAC>  Do we have a feel for which of these is more reliable?

   Cows and World Order  A CHRISTIAN: You have two cows. You keep one and give one to your neighbor.  A REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. So what?  A DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to your neighbor. You feel righteous.  A SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor.  A COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with milk.  A FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both and sells you the milk. You join the underground and start a campaign of sabotage.  DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The government taxes you to the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.  CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.  BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the drain.  AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell one, and force the other to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.  A FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows.  A JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk.  A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You re-engineer them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and milk themselves.  AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows, but you don't know where they are. You break for lunch.  A RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka.  A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, but you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap.  A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.  A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares bankruptcy.  AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship them.

 Dave,  I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that you can give us the same information that the course would while you are here?  Please let me know.  Thanks,  Paul D. Thomas Enron Wholesale Services East Power Trading (713) 853-0403 
 Dave, Willis Philip and I are scheduled to arrive in Albany around 2:45 PM on Oct. 15.  That should give us time to meet you there by 4 pm, however, if we should be delayed I will give you a call.  I appreciate you taking time to show us around your facilities.  Furthermore, we can all meet together when you come on the 22nd.  That should enable us to cover all the issues without redundancy.  I will talk to with Juan to firm up the exact meeting hours so that we can have an agenda for the day.  Paul 
 Willis, I let them know that we will be there unless we are delayed.  PT 
 Casey, I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.  I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.  Your final showed $341,000.  Please give me a call.  Paul 3-0403 
 Willis Philip and I are scheduled to attend the Oct 16 class.  Paul 3-0403 
 I do not think it was a price revision, hence I would like to see all the deals from the last half of the month.  I think some deals might have entered into the system incorrectly.  I will contact Warrick to see what deals he shows in the system.  Paul

 Virtual Bidding Questions  1)	How is uplift allocated when there is thunderstorm alert in NYC?  Is the uplift allocated to those short going into the real time in Zone J/K only or is it allocated statewide? 2)	When is uplift allocated statewide as opposed to superzone? 3)	Are credit amounts going to be adjusted and when?  Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure.  Thanks Tom 
 I do not see anything... it is just a link to the chronicle....
