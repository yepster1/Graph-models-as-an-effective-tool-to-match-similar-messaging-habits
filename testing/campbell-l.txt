ampling port locations. 
 Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.  As you may remember, Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire facility near Ft. Stockton.  Groundwater montioring activities have been ongoing since aprox. 1988.  A permit condition states that if three years of groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be terminated.  A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received on July 14, 1999.  Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....). Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site indefinately. 
 A phase I due diligence was completed for EOTT on two liquids pipeline segments in the Texas Panhandle and in Northwestern Colorado.  The assets are owned by Equilon Pipeline Company.  A copy of the findings have been submitted to Legal.  There were some deficiencies and potential liabilities discovered as a result of this activity.  Assisted the Roswell team in the preparation and completion of the 6 month and 12 Title V certification reports for the Roswell C/S.  No deficiencies or non compliance issues were identified for this 12 month period.  Annual certification reports were submitted to the TNRCC for 3 Transwestern and 8 Northern Natural Gas C/S in west Texas.  There wer no deficiencies or non compliance issues identified for any of the 11 facilities during this 12 month period.  The TNRCC reviewed the emissions testing report for the NNG Plains C/S and requested modification to the original report submitted.  The testing contractor was contacted and  a revised report was submitted to the agency. 
 I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.  I will send out the letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.  I would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing completed ASAP.  Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator on.  Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that we follow a portocol that I will submit to the state. 
 Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with the Office of Pipeline Safety.  When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.  Thanks. 
 Particpated in a Consolidated audit of two facilities on the Northern Border Pipeline system.  Very few items of concern were identified.  Submitted to the state of Texas Fish and Wildlife Service annual blanket renewal requests.  Submitted to the state of Arizona Shpo annual blanket renewal requests.  Submtted to the state of New Mexico Shpo and Fish and Wildlife Service annual blanket renewal requests.  A natural gas relase of 1.57MMscf was reported to the state of New Mexico and Houston GPG for a line lowering in an agricultural area.  The quarterly Transwestern SoCal PCB conference meeting was held. Transwestern's share of PCB activities on the SoCal system at 86% was $122,867. 
 George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly as possible.

 This is a message from Kerry.  I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.  He uses ESIS.  I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected (logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.  I received a message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was "Read-Only" when I attempted to re-link the tables.

 I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without any notification to the agency.  The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise them of such an activity..... 
 Lorraine, I dont have a problem with continuation of this sampling, but we better hear from our conservative tight fisted attorney first.... 
 Bill, Just a short note to let you know whats going on at Bakersfield.  I have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the NOV issues and have been told that EOTT will definately receive a an NOV and fine for failure to conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been tested approx. 6 months ago.  With repsect to the other NOV issue, Rick Suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another heater which was required to be tested by today.  As the testing contractor began his testing, an 02 issue developed with the equipment the testing company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing contractor was directed to Rick.  As a result,  the  the inspector observed elevated CO readings from the heater that  Rick had made adjustments in the heater set points (based upon recommendations from the contractor) causing the elevated CO readings to result.  The inspector stated that the facility would receive another NOV for this exceedance.   In any event this isssue was NOT Rick's fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the contractor.  We have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in another testing company (AEROS) on thursday.  This is the contractor who has done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first testing company's data.  With this new data, we shold be able to demonstrate inaccuracy in the first testing company's QA/QC.  It should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental issues which we should discuss at your convenience.  Butch and I will have completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for discussions on friday.    William Kendrick 01/10/2001 07:53 AM 
 A 2:00 pm central  time conference call has been scheduled to discuss the most recent PCB analytical results for the Topock Lateral.  Your attendance is requested.   The dial in number is   877-795-3687.  Access code is 395119.  Bob Iverson has been notified by phone and will be in attendance. 
 I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo.  The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to POEP for review.  With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different. The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer" with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells..  A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them.  It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done.  At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with this.  John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out. First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. Please get back with me on this. 
 This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been submitted to t he TNRCC.   The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit.  According to the agency, this replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will be a plus for the company.  My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make this happen.  I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received. 
 Rick, Terry had informed me that Solar had trouble with this unit in making its emissions guarantees, prior to shipping it to La Plata.  I was not aware of this when I permitted the unit.a couple of years ago. In an attempt to solve the problem, in November,  I had submitted a modification to the permit to the state of Colorado  requesting additional emissions as it appears the unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months.  I received a call form the state of Colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of more emissions for us.  We reached an agreement with the state that they would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement in an attempt to give us more operating room (the higher emissions months would be balanced by the warmer months which produce less emissions. However, after Terry went through the calculations we were still exceeding the permitted emission limits when we calculated yearly limits.  I dont know if Solar might have sold us a bill of goods but based upon emisisons calculations, the unit cant stay under the emissions guarantees that Solar promised.   We have notified the state of Colorado, as the permit requires and Im sure they will be following up on this.   Let me know what Solar says.......    Team San-Juan-LaPlata  01/24/2001 11:08 AM

 Ed the 6" project you are talking about is a small project independant of Rogas where a 6"line will be constructed from North Coles and run above ground, if possible, to a tie in approx. 1 mile away.  We will need a waiver for this.  There  wont be any by pass crossing concerns and  only ocal notifications due to the efforts to run the pipe above ground.  The reason for constructing above ground is to minimize surface disturbance.  Im sure that one of the conditions of the approval for this construction actiivty is that EOTT wil be required to maintain integrity of the pipeline to ensure no releases.....inspections, reporting etc....  Ill keep you in the loop on this..... 
 John, I had asked Randi to complete an annual report for the F&G 2081 permit, as I did not want to have this hang over our head when EOTT's 2081 application was reviewed.  This may be the annual report that were talking about.  As you remember, the 2081 requires an annual report for activities conducted for the prior year and it is due by Jan 10th of every year.  It was not been submitted for 1999 or  2000.  Because Randi has been personally involved in all construction activities at the North Coles Levee facility, I thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then we would submit.  If this is the annual report everyone is talking about, then, yes, I instructed her to do these, primarily, because she has been involved since the get go and she has the information.  She has also promised the reports to me by 2/15 for sumibttal to the F&G.    John Shafer 02/05/2001 04:09 PM 
 John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting and approvals.  The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies:  California fish and game 1603 application  Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application  US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification  Reclamation Board- encroachment application  Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline  Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline  I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances for this project.  I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field survey prior to construction.  It seems that every Califonia state and county agency is a candidate for notification or approval.   Ill keep you apprised...... 
 John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az. where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.  With this information please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).  We will use the same gas quality for each location.  I have a meeting with the agency on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to this date.  If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your assistance in this also.

 John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure. 
 Bill,  the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice.  I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project. He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units.  I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 report will be completed by March 1.  Is there something Ive missed? 
 A 2:00 pm central time conference call has been scheduled to discuss the most recent analytical results from the Topock Lateral PCB sampling.  Your attendence is requested for this call.  the dial in number is 877-795-3687. Conference code 395119.  Bob Iverson's name could not be found in tha Lotus directory but has been contacted via phone and will be in attendence. 
 This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail. 
 Thanx, George.  Please let us know what their initial reaction and evaluation is of the conditions at Sta. 6.  Im interested in what their thoughts are with respect to the remediation of  the sandstone fractures and movement of condensate with PCB's..    George Robinson 02/21/2001 01:46 PM 
 Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to discuss? 
 I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe) in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.  I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide input for that as well from an LDC standpoint.  I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know the results of the meeting. 
 Mr. Stewart, as per you voice mail request to me on Feb. 20, 2001, attached is the correspondance concerning the reqeust to replace the mixing valves with carbuerators at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.   The players in this activity included Jon Fields of Argent Consulting.  Due to the fact that the pre testing data for the emissions from the mixing valves and the post testing data for emissions from the carbuerators were received in hard copy only, I am not able to provide this as an attachment.  This data was, however, sent to you via fed-x on January 24, 2001.  If needed, I can resubmit the results of the data for your review.   As expected, the emissions levels did decrease when the carbs were installed.  Please reveiw the attached correspondance concerning the request to replace the mixing valves at the Spraberry Plant (TNRCC account No. ML-0022-W) with carbuerators without requiring involvement of a permitting activity.  Thank you for your consideration in this issue. 
 Mr. Stewart, as per your voice mail request on Feb. 20, 2001, attached find the correspondance relating to the request of replacing the existing mixing valves with carburetors at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.  In this discussion, Jon Fields of Argent Consulting was involved.  I have attached for your review the letter requests from Northern to you and the e-mails which were traded back and forth from yourself and Argent.  The results of the pre testing emissions with the mixing valves on and the post testing of the emissions with the carburetors on were mailed to you on Jan. 20, 2001.  The testing results were compiled in hard copy form and are not included with this submittal, but can be resubmitted if requested.  Your favorable request in this replacement activity is requested. 
 Arnold, I think I will pass on the meeting.  Please apprise me of anything I may need to know from the meeting.  To bring you up to date on the environmental events of the turbine approvals in Arizona,  I received the rough draft of the baseline noise survey and you were copied.  As discussed, we should address changes to the documents as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of what we would like to do or not do.  I was contacted by the Navajo Nation and they have requested that we do onsite surveys at the C/S on the reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  I have contacted a contractor and they will be on site to do the surveys at both stations.  I am planning on having the entire C/S facility surveyed at both locations as there has not been a pin point location established as yet for all the construction and ground disturbance which will take place.  In the event there might be changes after the survey is completed, surveying the entire facility will keep us from having the new distrubance areas surveyed after the original survey was completed.  The F-1 environmental document for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by this friday.   The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   I have a meeting with EPA in San Francisco to discuss permitting the C/S facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  Im going to try and move this meeting up if possible.  After the meeting, I should be able to have an application in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a week.  Based upon experience with the state of Arizona, EPA and the Navajo Nation, expect permit approval within 5-7 months after submittal of the application. 
 I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only last 3-4 hours.  Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on.  The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let you know when I find out something.......... 
 Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last couple of weeks, but heres whats new:  A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the Rogas project.  The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.  Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.
