ed to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. 
 Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion.  In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle.  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing.  Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a conference call for sometime next week? 
 I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to discuss the issue with Arco. I will keep everyone apprised on the progress. 
 I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.  The report is to be submitted by January 31st of each year.  If we need to discuss this, give me a call. 
 The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.  Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.  A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue.  Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine status of permit compliance with each air permit. 
 Kim, please give me a call at (505) 625-8022 concerning the above.  Im trying to generate employee interest in the RMEF and need some help.  Ive gotten some positive requests and involvement from some employees about the Foundation, but would like to open it up to others in Enron. 
 Mr. Cates, sir, would you please approve of the attached expense report?  You are a kind and generous man. 
 Be advised that there will be a meeting on Thursday 11:00 am August 23 at the NNG Turbine station, south of Kermit Tx.  to complete and submit annual certification reports which are required by the following Title V permitted facilities:  Seminole Brownfield Plainview  Spraberry  Irion Co. No. 1 Reagan Co. 2 Eldorado  Wt-2 Walton Keystone  Kermit Turbine  Should a team decide not to attend this meeting, be advised that the required submittal date for the annual certifications for the state of Texas is September 8, 2001.  It will be your teams responsibility to ensure that the certifications are submitted prior to the 9/8/01 deadline should you decide not to attend the August 23 meeting. 
 Participated in the compliation and submittal of the Title V semi annual monitoring and annual certification reports for the NNG Eunice C/S.  Data gathering and correspondance continues with the third party lawyer for the NOV issue at the P-1 C/S.  This involved a like for like replacement of a turbine in New Mexico.  Annual blanket renewal requests were submitted to the Texas SHPO and the Arizona F&W.  A permit be rule has been submitted to the TNRCC for the like for like I/C engine replacement at the NNG Reagan Co 2 C/S.  The EOTT tank database is 90% complete.  Field verification with each team will begin to determine  compliance with recordkeeping, fees, NSPS and air permit status.  Air permits for the EOTT facilities in New Mexico were copied from the  agencies records.  Compliance status will be determined for these facilities also. 
 John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E:  1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations.  2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?  3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be nice   depicting this.  4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible.  5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort to  show our commitment.  John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters. If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is $$$$$$$, although they do a good job.  Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you plan on asking him to attend the meeting........ 
 In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance:  Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am  Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am  Jal team  August 8 8:00 am  Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am  I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022. 
 I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future.  In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list. 
 John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.  I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E? As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue up in Flagstaff.  Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and thoughts. 
 A meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance with the recently issued NOV for the P-1 C/S over a like for like turbine exchange which occurred in 1996.  A history was given of the incidents which led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern had with the AQB in 1996 which lead Transwestern to believe that issue had been resolved.  The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system.  Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led to this emergency training being given.  Based upon a phone call with Region 7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to facilities that submit incomplete "Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for Reportable Events". 
 A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput criteria, please provide to me the following:   tank name/serial number  tank size  average daily throughput  Thanks for your help in this matter.... 
 Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20 status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9= 8%=20 complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the= =20 month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20 Region.

 I just spoke to the state of Arizona concerning the tree removal at Station 2.  Their response to our request to remove the trees has been APPROVED, provided that this is the only pre activity  we do prior to receiving the air permit.  This means that no other  construction or preparation activities can be performed  or conducted untill the air permit has been issued.   This approval also includes stump removal if need be...... 
 NNG Gomez Plant, Site Cleanup has been completed.  All activities associated with the items identified during the sale of the facility have been corrected. Becuse ET&S  owns and WGR operates, there is a concern that WGR may not adhear to compliance and housekeeping  at the facility.  This has been the case in the past.  Discussions will be held with Enron Legal to address these concerns.  TW Bell Lake Gas Plant, Ground Water Remediation.  A revised Water Development Easement from the State Land Office was received. This will allow TW access to install one additional downgradient groundwater monitor well. The tentative schedule to install the well will be the week of September 13th.  A construction permit application for installation of an SVE remediation system for the North Crawar C/S was mailed to the TNRCC.  The State of New Mexico conducted an air quality inspection of the Atoka No. 2 C/S.  No items or deficiencies were identified by the agency.  The Title V air permit application for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was mailed to the State of New Mexico, Air Qualtiy Bureau.  The Notice of Intent air permit application for the Crawford C/S was mailed to the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau.  Annual blanket request letters were submitted to the USFWS in New Mexico and Texas for renewal.  A meeting was held in Houston with John Woodyard of Roy F. Weston and ET&S mgt. addressing PCB activity in natural gas pipelines as related to the PG&E PCB Topock Lateral issue. 
 Sta.3, 4 and 5  As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor station.  Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 agencies:  Navajo Nation EPA P.O. Box 339 Window Rock, AZ 86515  Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager   US EPA    Region IX 75 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94105  Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6)   Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also.  I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 4 and 5 reports to station 5.  The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022.. 
 The Air Quality Bureau conducted an agency inspection of C/S's 7 Mountainair and 8 Corona.  There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by the inspector.  Facility records were copied from the Air Quality Bureas files in Santa Fe for the P-1 C/S.  The excess emissions semiannual report as required under NSPS for turbines was submitted for the Bloomfield C/S.  A custom fuel monitoring schedule  reqeust was submitted to Region VI EPA for the NNG Plains turbine C/S.  Emissions fees were submitted for Laguna C/S.  A meeting will be held with the vice president of development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to begin preparation of a MOU between Enron and the Foundation.  The meeting will be held in Albuq. during the 1st or 3rd week in August. 
 Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy. Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation and enhancement.  Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.  You can click the button that says "Become a member" and sign up for the annual membership at that time.  At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a total by  team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the Nature Conservancy by the end of the month.  Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated 
 Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area. Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  "up front" with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway.  As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure. However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assist in the environmental budgeting for this project. 
 Kevin, as promised, attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area...... 
 George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.  I have not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.  Dave was going to inform the OCD that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite Bill's review process.  Ill let you know when I hear from the OCD. 
 Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.  I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known. 
 The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are on this. 
 The Southwest Region will be hosting its 2001 environmental roundtable in Albuquerque, NM on October 16-17 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (505) 821-3333.  Room rates are $89.00 per night.  Each attendee will be responsible for his/her room reservations for the two day event.  The agenda for this roundtable will be sent out in the near future.

 As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential risk impact.  A rating of "0" indicates that there is no risk associated with this regulation or issue and a rating of "3" indicates a major problem or an issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or formally close each issue.  Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of information presented.  General Pipeline Characteristics ;  This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small volumes of compressor oils are collected. All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future. The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). this is a non Title V major source. NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their underground storage capacity. NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the agencies. Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.  Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. Risk: 0  Cost: $0  Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices (<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved. Risk: 0  Cost: $0  PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected. Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown. Risk:  1  Cost: $0  Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used. Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000  Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous waste. Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined  Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste. Risk: 0  Cost:  0  NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company. Risk:  1  Cost:  $500  Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure of this site is expected in the near future. Risk: 1  Cost: $500  LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant. Risk: 0  Cost:  $0  Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.  Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately $94,000. Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000  Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature. Risk: 1   Cost: $0  Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park. The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts. NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site. Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000  Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination.  Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956. During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in 1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000 
 The PCB Annual Document Logs for the facilities that generated PCB waste and stored it at TW's long term storage facility were completed and distributed to locations and entered into Envisions.  The 2rd quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB mgt. committee conference call was completed.  This committee meets to discusss PCB management on the SoCal system and review invoices generated by SoCal during each quarter.  This quarters invoice amount was $280,633.48 of which Transwestern is 86% responsible or $241,344.79.  Final activities are in progress at the Topock Lateral where cleanup of the 1850' pipeline and appurtenances has been completed.  Analytical results of the wipe samples and liquid samples taken showed the cleanup to be successful.   All wipes after the cleaning showed to be less than 1 microgram/100 cm. sq.  Analytical results of the liquids showed to be less than 20 ppb.  The next phase of the cleanup activities will be in November when the remaining 11 miles of pipe will be cleaned and have launcher facilities installed at the mainline interconnect. 
 Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along with them....  Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands
