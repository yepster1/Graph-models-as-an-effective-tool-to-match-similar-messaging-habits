treet.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.  Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4.  Ill keep everyone apprised of future events. 
 Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the Foundation.  Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification report submittals.  Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of hazardous waste.  Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components (inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. 
 John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.  Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can "advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement with the RMEF? 
 Eunice team,  The NNG Eunice C/S is required to prepare and submit the semi annual and annual reports required by the facilities Title V Operating Permit which was issued by the State of New Mexico.  The reports are required to be submitted to the state of New Mexico and the EPA by July 19, 2001.   These reports are required even though the facility is not in operation.  If you would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document, give me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the C/S to do each report. This should take about half a day. 
 Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management. They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the Foundations new CEO........ 
 I would be honored.  Do we meet there or somewhere else?

 Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other compressor station locations and have been approved to use "stain tubes" or total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help. If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?

 Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.  Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.

 10-4.  I saw a picture of Dustin's deer, pretty nice.  someone from BLM told me a deer came in from the sandhills east of town that was 29" and non typical.  I also heard of some deer that were taken north of town that were pretty nice also (16-24"). Dont you think it s funny that we spend all kinds of money and time traveling to all our secret spots and the big ones are right in our back yard?  Im planning on taking some time off for the holidays, so If I dont hear from you have a wonderful Christmas and keep your focus on the Lord, He's our only salvation.  So often we look to other things to give us security and joy and we so often forget, that for those that love Him and have confessed Him as our Savior He is our strength and hope of a future eternal glory.....May God be your source of strength, Merry Christmas... 
 Charlie, when Butch had Getman's wife count the number of people using the water at Station 5, did the number of users not equal the public water system numbers (ie 25 people daily at least 60 days per year?)  I though we were always a public water system at Station 5?   We better discuss this, as we could be in some trouble if we do service 25 people and are not doing the sampling..... 
 I HAVE submitted all receipts for the expense reports submitted to you.  I will resend them again. 
 David, I got hte same message from Don.  I found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Christ with him.  Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal Christian.  So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.  Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focused also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.  It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.  The gossip and garbage going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.   Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  I hope that this turns many to Jesus.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.  Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....

 I received this message 
 thanx dude. 
 David, the next matrix yousend in, please provide information in box D where is asks for location of activities.  station yard, right of way, tandk farm etc... 
 Thanks, Celestine, everything appears to be working fine..... 
 John, Im in the office for a few hours cleaning out email and stomping out some minor fires.  The two RMEF persons we met with are Dan Walker and Allen Kerby.  Allen is the regional director for NM and TX.  Dan was the guy we picked up at the airport from Montana.  I think his title was VP of business operations?  His number is 1-800-225-5355.  Allen's number in Las Vegas NM is 505-454-9390.  Hope that all is well with you and the family. 
 thanks, Danny for sending out this heads up 
 Steve, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the engine load was 89%.  If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testing for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.  My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it. 
 David got your voice mail last week.  Sorry about not getting to talk with you, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give Enron my vacation.  Im not going to give it away anymore.  I would have liked to talked to you.  Things are somewhat stressful around here.  Probably worse in Houston.  Enron is screening  e mails so everyone is a little tense. Lots of things are going on with Enron trying to bail itself out of this mess.  As you may have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and Don Stevens were among those.  Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on, so I really dont know much.  This was a good time to take my vacation.  This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying on Jesus, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort. Its a good feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine.  Hows Christmas in the desert? Were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree?  this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.  David, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry Christmas.  I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.  When we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.  I pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people  in Katar and remember the love of Christ that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.  I am thankful for our Great High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of Holies.  May God bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of His love and grace.  Merry Christmas, Your brother in Christ 
 Mark, this is correct 
 David I got your test 
 Adel, please send this blank matrix to the project manager and have them complete the title information amd items A through E in the upper box on the first page, then send it to me. This will greatly  assist me in determining what permits, plans and other regulatory documents will be requried.  thanks 
 Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....
