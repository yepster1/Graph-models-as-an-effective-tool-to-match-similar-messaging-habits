 information, book admin id is one of the fields he needs.  When you have decided can you please input that into the trader matrix and I'll then forward everything to Ramesh.  Thanks  Kam 
 Susan,  What time can that estate book be ready to go?  KK

 Do you remember at what price do we own Microsoft? 
 Greg,  There are still about 2,000 deals between ECC and Riskmantra that need to be moved to the Bankruptcy books.  IT did all ECC to ENA deals, they need to change the script to ECC and Riskmantra.  We started to move some of the deals manually but there are too many to do.  Sanjeev Gupta has been doing this for us in the past.   I left a message with him but you might want someone to follow up with him to make sure it happens before calcing time today.   Here is a list of the deals if you guys are looking for work to do.   Thanks  KK 
 We have a copy of the p&l format we will all be using saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\blank P&L.xls.  If you are setting up your formulas you can use this format to create all your links for the new NGP&L and then change them to the individual p&l's later, we will be deciding how to break out the traders sometime this week.  Attached is a list of the book names and the traders associated with each book.   Let me know what you guys need to get all of this set up this week.  Thanks  Kam 
 Thank you.  KK 
 O'neal Winfree currently manages the Texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group.  He works closely with the Desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and P&L's.  He has eliminated most OA variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well.  O'neal and his group recently created a new physical P&L reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups.  Scott Palmer is currently the East desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that.  He set up and managed the Wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply.  He was also responsible for calculating and reporting the Virginia Natural Gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at VNG and Sequent to resolve any issues or questions.  James Hungerford has been a book administrator on the East region for the past six months.  He quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders' P&L's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the Weapon-X database, automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily VaR estimate process.  Prior to risk management, James was the Operational Analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems. 
 Thank you.  Here are the NT id's. 
 Bob Hall will have the mid and back office list and Ed McMichael should have the front office.  KK 
 There are a few deals that we have agreed to perform on 100% and Ed McMichael needs to be able to value those deals separately.  KK 
 Susan,  Can you please set up the attached book for the estate.  Thanks  KK 
 Question:  Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.  Kam 
 Will you still need the GD curves, GD-HPL/SHPCH and GD-WAHA, or can the GDP be used instead?  KK 
 Attached are the book requests for the NetCo. books.  They have already been set-up in Global Counterparties.  Thanks,  Kam 
 We don't have access to UBS applications today.  They are supposed to make the switch for us tonight.  I have Stephanie a list of risk people that need access to the reports so after tonight we'll be able to test it out.  Thanks  KK 
 Zhiyong needs to get a list of all curves we will be loading for Netco. by tomorrow.  When you all are done identifying those curves could you please get me a list of the curves by risk type?  Thanks  Kam 
   Attached are the original spreadsheets with additional book requests in yellow.  This should be the end, or close to it, for the Netco gas book requests.  As before, could I get the global id's once you are finished?   Thanks,  Kam 
 Sorry,  I forgot to attach the spreadsheet. 
 Scott,  Just so I understand correctly,  for the dollars in green, we are to pay Coral this amount as demand charges?  KK 
 John,  At some point I would recommend setting up a mailbox for your new controls group.  That way we won't have to worry about who is doing what, everyone in the group will get it.  The current controls group did that and it was much easier.  KK 
 Cheryl,  Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.  I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct? I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.  Thanks again,  Kam x3-5781 
  Correction Please ignore post-id #1457413 It should be #1457867 with a value of $(392,639)  Thanks  Kam 
  correction please replace 1457413 with 1457867  Thanks  Kam 
 Post id's for today  1457408 1457409 1457410 1457411 1457412 1457413 1457414  Kam x3-5781 
 Tiffany  This is the value by risk type as of Nov-30th.

KK x3-5781 
 Cheryl,  The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.   Thanks,  Kam x3-5781 
 Thank you.  Kam 
 Cecilia,  We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.  Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.  Thanks  Kam  x3-5781 
 Z,  Attached are the files that need to be copied for the Netco files.   I will get you the list of curves tomorrow and you should talk to Louise for a list of the Netco traders.   Thanks  Kam 
 Andrew,  The following are the people that will be setting up new books for Netco.  The e-requests have been submitted.  Kam Keiser O'neal Winfree Phillip Love Scott B. Palmer John Valdes Errol McLaughlin    Thanks  Kam 
  I tried to breakout the curves for Keith and Frank in the file you are working on but we should run that by them for approval.  Mike will be setting all gas daily and physical curves.  I think we can combine basis, index and GDI curves into one file per trader leaving only three curve files to load.  Let me know what you think.  Once we get their ok on the curves, we can set them up and let them add any formulas they need, especially Mikes file.  KK 
  Phillip,  I tried to breakout the curves that Keith and Frank will be setting in the file you have been working in.  We probably should run these past them to make sure 
 Bryce,  These deals have been corrected.  The triggers and demand charges have been removed.  Deal #1005851 did have gas flow and I believe should still be settled unless someone says otherwise.  Thanks  Kam 
 Ok, just tell me what needs to be done in sitara and we'll take care of it.  KK 
 Please cancel my membership.  Thanks  Kam Keiser 3-5781 
 I have highlighted the risk people in grey.  Can you add Jeff Gossett and Matt Olney? I will send this to Power to check their names.  Thanks 
 Mike,  Let me know when you are free, I would like to bring Phillip Love up to meet you.   KK 
 I have done all of these except the PGL&C deals.  Scott, should these be terminated?  KK 
 Torrey,  We have taken over the responsibilities for setting up new books so we will be learning that today.  These books should be ready by Wednesday.  I will know more after we speak with them today.  Once they are ready, we will send you the matrix you forwarded me.  I have a question about that, you have a column for TAGG financial and physical.  What is the difference?  Thanks  Kam 
 The sitara mapping table is saved in the Ne
