dollars in green, we are to pay Coral this amount as demand charges?  KK 
 John,  At some point I would recommend setting up a mailbox for your new controls group.  That way we won't have to worry about who is doing what, everyone in the group will get it.  The current controls group did that and it was much easier.  KK 
 Cheryl,  Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.  I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct? I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.  Thanks again,  Kam x3-5781 
  Correction Please ignore post-id #1457413 It should be #1457867 with a value of $(392,639)  Thanks  Kam 
  correction please replace 1457413 with 1457867  Thanks  Kam 
 Post id's for today  1457408 1457409 1457410 1457411 1457412 1457413 1457414  Kam x3-5781

 Cheryl,  The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.   Thanks,  Kam x3-5781 
 Thank you.  Kam 
 Cecilia,  We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.  Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.  Thanks  Kam  x3-5781 
 Z,  Attached are the files that need to be copied for the Netco files.   I will get you the list of curves tomorrow and you should talk to Louise for a list of the Netco traders.   Thanks  Kam 
 Andrew,  The following are the people that will be setting up new books for Netco.  The e-requests have been submitted.  Kam Keiser O'neal Winfree Phillip Love Scott B. Palmer John Valdes Errol McLaughlin    Thanks  Kam 
  I tried to breakout the curves for Keith and Frank in the file you are working on but we should run that by them for approval.  Mike will be setting all gas daily and physical curves.  I think we can combine basis, index and GDI curves into one file per trader leaving only three curve files to load.  Let me know what you think.  Once we get their ok on the curves, we can set them up and let them add any formulas they need, especially Mikes file.  KK 
  Phillip,  I tried to breakout the curves that Keith and Frank will be setting in the file you have been working in.  We probably should run these past them to make sure 
 Bryce,  These deals have been corrected.  The triggers and demand charges have been removed.  Deal #1005851 did have gas flow and I believe should still be settled unless someone says otherwise.  Thanks  Kam 
 Ok, just tell me what needs to be done in sitara and we'll take care of it.  KK 
 Please cancel my membership.  Thanks  Kam Keiser 3-5781 
 I have highlighted the risk people in grey.  Can you add Jeff Gossett and Matt Olney? I will send this to Power to check their names.  Thanks 
 Mike,  Let me know when you are free, I would like to bring Phillip Love up to meet you.   KK 
 I have done all of these except the PGL&C deals.  Scott, should these be terminated?  KK 
 Torrey,  We have taken over the responsibilities for setting up new books so we will be learning that today.  These books should be ready by Wednesday.  I will know more after we speak with them today.  Once they are ready, we will send you the matrix you forwarded me.  I have a question about that, you have a column for TAGG financial and physical.  What is the difference?  Thanks  Kam 
 The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls  Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.   Thanks  KK 
 Darron,  The curve lists are saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\central\current central/ontario curves.xls   I can help you sort through those if you want help.   KK 
 Mike,  Will there be a Denver region for Netco?  I have assumed that everything will be considered West but want to make sure before we set up the books.  Thanks Kam 
 Scott,  Yes, my group will be the ones to book the demand charges in sitara.  Can you please contact that regional controller for the charges.  West-Kam Keiser Central-Scott Palmer East-Phillip Love Texas-O'neal Winfree  Thanks Kam 
 John,  Are you ready to learn your first control function.  The controls group is going to let us set up the new books we need for Netco today.  When you are ready let me know and we'll go down there, or they will come up here or whatever.  Kam 
 Shona,  I understand we will now the group to set up new books.  Can we get some instructions from someone in your group, Susan I assume.  John Valdes and myself will be the ones to take this over.  Please let me know if Susan is this person and we'll get with her today.  Thanks  Kam 
 The following will be the deal entry procedures for UBSWEnergy:  Financial 1.  All non-electronic financial deals to be entered directly by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office  Physical 1.  All current month physical deals to be booked directly into Sitara by front office (logistics/trading) 2.  All prompt month forward deals to be booked directly into TDS by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office - physical meters to be added by logistics/trading 
 Shona,  Here is our updated form A without intercompany deals.  Included on the last two tabs are the details they asked for from gas.  We are still working on the contracts and confirms.   Thanks  KK 
 Russ,  Can we get a list of the mappings for all sitara locations.  We are modifying our curve files by getting rid of all "internal" curves.  We need to make sure that we don't have anything mapped to those curves and if so make some changes.  We also need to think about how this change will work with the estate as well.  Will sitara have a separate database for Netco and estate like TAGG will?  Kam 
 Can they be done by Tuesday next week?  EOL needs these to get this information soon in order to start their set up process.  Kam 
 The Keyspan deals have been corrected.   Kam 
  Please use this form instead of the previous west file  Thanks 
 Susan,  These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.  Thanks  Kam 
 Can we postpone this to this afternoon?  I am in the middle of a project.  I will call you soon.  KK 
 Attached is a file listing the names and NT login id's for our group. Please call me if you need any additional information.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 Phillip,  Do you want me to do anything for the new west curve files or are you taking care of it?  KK 
  Here is the list you requested.  KK 
 Chuck,  I know you made some extremely detailed notes for the morning reports but I can't seem to find anyone down here that has them.  Do you still have a copy saved you could send me?   KK 
  Here is the updated list.  Thanks 
 Biliana,  Do you have a copy of the detailed procedures that Chuck prepared for the morning reports?  I am looking for a copy in excel if you have them.  KK 
 Let me know if there is anything I help you guys with for the controls reports.  I would like to be involved in this process to understand it better.  Kam 
 Thanks,  Chris was able to get me a copy of that yesterday.  KK 
 there is a book request form in Netco\controls\Book request form.xls.  I put in the west desk books already.  Susan is checking to see if we can use those portfolio and book codes, if not we'll change them.   KK 
 Yes,  The first three legs are the purchase for 80,000/d.  Leg 4 is the annuity, and leg 5 is the put.  I don't think I know what you are asking.  KK 
 Darren  The counterparty short name you gave me doesn't exist in TAGG.  Is this a new name?  Kam x3-5781 
 Will anyone be taking Tori's place or are we down to 9 books?  KK 
 Mike,  We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.  We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.  Thanks Kam 
 thank you 
 We are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to Netco today.  Please look in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West and if there is a file you used to run, (price reports, the wood report, broker, desk to desk, consolidated P&L for the website, etc.) that you don't see out there now, please save a copy to this directory this morning.  Thanks  KK 
 I will be attending.  Kam 
 Ryan,  Can you save a copy of all of the files you did for Grigsby, price and position reports, to O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West.  We are taking copies of everything we use now, this is the file that will be moved with us.   Thanks Kam 
 Zach,  Let's try for tomorrow morning around 9:30.  Stop by desk and we'll run through the basics.  KK 
 I started a spreadsheet for us to keep track of our books, traders, file names, etc.  It is saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Controls\Trader Matrix.xls  Please add any other fields you think we should have.  Jeff mentioned he wants to be able to quickly tell what books belong to what traders, O'neil had this idea. Is everyone ready to start setting up their books today?  Has Scott Neal gotten back to you yet Phillip?  KK 
 We have decided to name our books FB-West1 thru 10......for each region  We will have a matrix saved for everyone to be able to look at with the book names, trader names, sitara books, P&L file name, global id, and everything else that anyone might want to see.  I think this will make things more consistent than coming up with new stupid names like before.  All books, including the financial books, will have the same portfolio and book codes.  Physical books will be seperate but will all be the same.   KK 
 Biliana,  We are making sure this week that we have all the files we use listed to be moved to Netco.  Can you please make a list of all the paths and files used to prepare the morning reports, including the VaR access database?  I will need this before lunch.   Thanks  Kam 
 Z,  We have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with Netco.  Will these directories be moved so that the estate can't use them, or will copies be made so both groups could use the files?  If not, we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already.   Thanks  Kam 
 I brought some of my natural gas and options books from home.  Please come by my desk if you want to read one during the day or make copies of some chapters to take home with you.   KK 
 Please take me off your list.  I don't wish to receive any more email from you.

 Zach,  Can you get together Friday morning to go over the basics of what we do?  I will try to find some old class materials for you to review as well. I will let you know when and where tomorrow.  Thanks, Kam 
 Sorry,  Chicago gave us the wrong post-id's.   1477539 1477540 1477541 1477548 1477549 1477550 1477551 1477560 1477563 1477564 1477568 1477571 1477572  Thanks again.  KK 
 Sure, I spoke with him today about that already.  KK 
 Have you started to set up any new books for NetCo. yet?  Do you guys think we should all use the same book and portfolio codes this time to make mini-books easier? Also, I think we should have some consistency in book names (make them more descriptive).  any other suggestions?  KK 
 If you don't have these already.   Monte,  I will help you with these.  KK 
 Susan,  Could I please get a copy of a blank book request from you.   Thanks  Kam 
 do I need to ask him which ones will have physical or did he tell you anything? 
 Chance,  We need to prepare the morning reports for the last day of the year.  Biliana isn't here today, could you please take care of that today for her?  Thanks  Kam 
 Now that the auction is underway and the possibility of being purchased in very high, we need to get back in gear, TODAY.  1.	Everyone needs to be here no later than 8:00am, 7:30 once we start trading again 2.	No playing on the internet or other games (ex. cards) - this will no longer be tolerated 3.	I have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to LEARN. bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry start studying the firms rolls, learn what the macros do, develop new checks and balances become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from understand the curve files (these will change but the general format will be similar)  Just to be clear, this is coming down from Jeff Gossett. The list for NetCo. is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up, or if someone doesn't.  We are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company. I know it has been boring but things need to change starting today, things will start to pick up in the next few days.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14th.  I would like to get your ideas for changes/improvements to our current processes/systems.  We have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed. This is our chance to change the things we couldn't before.  There is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before.  Please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have, no matter how small, every little bit helps.  Come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns,  Thanks, Kam 
 West 103816 
 Has everyone saved all their necessary files to the netco. directory?  I will be starting this list today.  Thanks  Kam 
 FYI...  I changed a deal you booked on Friday from IM WC CAL to IM WEST.  That book no longer exists.   Thanks  KK

 We need to add the RAC website to our list of programs to be moved over with Netco.  the website is rac.enron.com Let me know when you get this if there is anything we need to do to make sure this happens.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 Greg,  Have you had a chance to look at the new forwards details we talked about?  Kam 
 John,  I was just thinking about the December liquidations.  We moved many deals over to a book called Bankruptcy for december forward production months.  We won't be calculating this book but I'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for Jim's (or whoever) schedule.  If they do, we will have huge OA because we killed the swaps on those physical deals, meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same.  We'll see those variances, and at the same time Financial acct. should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not "flashed" in our P&L's.  How can we tell if that book will liquidate this month or not?  KK 
 Errol,  Here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight.  You probably don't have access to the Canadian book so you can get it from Jeremy or use my computer.  The right one has portcalc up, kkeiser & tamu96ddd.  They might need to be on inexact for basis and index. Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to John Powell, Debbie Brackett and Stephanie McGinnis?  Thanks  Kam call me if you have any problems 713-398-4735 
 I started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.  Going forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.  See you on Monday.  Kam 
 Scott,  I did the last four pages of this.  The pages before that look like they have already been done.  I just spot checked most of them but the entire first page was done already.  I didn't want to waste time, Bridgette is out until next year so I couldn't ask her what the problem is.  I'll leave the pages on your desk.  Kam

 Ryan,  Everyone else is going to be here on Monday so please feel to stay a few extra days.  We will have the normal closing stuff, (liquidations, PMA's, etc.)  I've already checked out our PMA's and we don't have anything to liquidate so it should be a piece of cake.  Things may pick up a little bit on Wednesday getting the books closed for the year. See you then  Have a great weekend,  Kam 
 FYI......  We are not bringing in prompt month value tonight.  Texas did, about $25,000.  The other regions don't have what we need for demand charges, etc. and no one has taken any time to research the values yet.  The other groups we need have been gone for hours.  We have some large positions which I don't really think are right.  I'll look closer in the morning.  Hope you feel better soon, at least you have all weekend to recover.  See you Monday,  Kam : )

 Jeff,  Here are the post-id's for you (or whoever) for Friday.  Ignore the CAN tab.  You should have access to these books, if not you can use my computer.  kkeiser & tamu96ddd on the right computer.  I may come in for the afternoon.  Let me know if you will need help for anything else, I'll come in.  There hasn't been anything going on except running mini-books for Russell Diamond.   See you later,  Kam 
 Scott,  Can you check the contract on #500282.  The chicago office needed to add a month to this deal and it wouldn't let it due to the contract #.  I changed it but probably shouldn't have.  It probably needs a new ticket.  Let me know.   Kay in Chicago needed this at 312-541-1235  Thanks  Kam 
 Amanda,  Can you please look at the last line for Management West?  Those deals are booked to the FT-CAND-EGSC book in Canada.  It wasn't reflected in our P&L's, it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance.  Thanks  Kam 
 Done.  KK 
 Scott,  Scott Tackett has taken over Sean's responsibilities.  He can take care of this for you.  Thanks  Kam 
  can you take care of this? 
 Does this need to exclude intercompany deals also? 
 please add Stephanie McGinnis to the email.  it should be  John Powell Debbie Brackett Stephanie McGinnis 
 Hector,  Carole Frank has resigned effective today.  I will collect her badge and any other equipment.  Please let me know if there is anything else that we need to do.  Thanks  Kam 
 Francis,  Can you call Errol McLaughlin or Jeff Gossett when you are done?  Thanks  Kam 
 This what she sent.  Thanks  Kam

 I started calculating the bankruptcy book last night for the credit group.  This needs to be done nightly.  I may be out a few days so if I am can someone else take this over from me please?  We can also use these to check daily for counterparties that have been moved incorrectly.  The file is in O:\erms\1intra\west\Bankruptcy post-ids.xls  Thanks  KK 
 All deals have been moved to ENA-IM WEST last night.  Set up your physical post-id's for today and calculate the weapon-X, make sure there are no deals in your books using a forwards detail.  If it is blank, you can run your weapon-X and input into your P&L this morning, you will also need to officialize your physical book one last time.  Financial - you don't need to roll your p&l anymore, (except for Monte, you will have to due to the transport model). Go into the RAC website and inactivate all of your books other than the physical, you will do that tomorrow.  Now that all tagg deals are in one book, we will be splitting up the alphabet among all groups to help monitor that the correct counterparties are being moved to the Bankuptcy book.  We will get with you all later regarding that.   Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks  KK 
  Oops,  I forgot you.  KK 
 It was just a funny song making fun of Enron.  You didn't miss out on much. I signed the offer letter last week, and we went through the orientation and filled out the piles of paperwork.  I won't have the new title and company name officially until the 8th I heard.  What is up with you?  How's the car treating you?  Were you able to sell the maroon thing? I'm house shopping now, I want to build one, just don't know where.  It is fun looking though.  Talk to you later,  KK 
 We are still trying to figure out some of the cash traders.  Once we get the word from Lavo we'll let you know.  Thanks  KK 
 Hey,  I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano that weekend.  I wish I could make it.  What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or are the other possibilities you had better?  Talk to you soon,  Kam

 As seen below,  Please start using the ENA DPR 0102 file rather than the EWS DPR 2002 file to send to Chris.  The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF's.  Thanks  Kam could you also CC me the first few times you send it? 
 Kristen,  Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  Greg Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.   Thanks  Kam 
  Ed,  Here is a list of the risk people that will be with the estate.  After this weekend, we will no longer have access to the estate files, these people will be able to help you with any of your questions.  We will still be around to assist them if needed.  Thanks  KK 
 Sanjeev,  I should have a list of post-id's for you by 4:30 today.  After friday, I will no longer have access to the estate, so if you could shoot this off over night so I could have something in the morning to work with I would appreciate it.  Let me know if that doesn't seem possible. Thanks  Kam 
 This was settled with Chris Abel last night. We have always reported our positions in contracts, they want to see it in BCF.  We will be reporting it that way going forward.  Kam 
  Is this going to change?  Do we have a new book set up for this?  KK 
  Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.  Thanks 
 Price, Basis and Index. 
  I got the Goldman counterparty names from Bill Hare and I have found 0 deals with them.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.   Kam 
  James,  Could you go back to the detail we used to do the form A, there is also a cross commodity file that needs to be added, and remove all intercompany deals and redo.  Let me check it once you have all of those deals isolated, just to check over the names once again.  Thanks  KK 
 Also, all physical weapon-X tabs are linking to an old east book.  I didn't touch that tab yet, we don't know if we're using weapon-X or sasqwatch.  KK 
 Thank you. 
 Here are the updated ERV names.  users highlighted in grey.  Thanks  KK 
 We are paused on this for now.  UBS isn't supposed to get any Enron info and that is what this project was intended to do.  Here is the attachment but don't waste any time until further notice. 
 Does he know to set up us as web users also?  Can you add Errol to the first list?  KK 
  More testing.  Recruit as many people as you need to help you.  I want these tested very thoroughly.  Thanks 
 Thomas,  Could you use this file to replace what we currently have for the new DPR?  Thanks  Kam 
 Could you please add me to this distribution list for any issues regarding the DPR?  Thanks 
 I will have the procedures for deal entry to you tomorrow.  Keith Holst is also taking a look at the current deal ticket and might be making some changes.  I'll run it by you before we finalize it.   Thanks Kam 
  Kim,  I am trying to find the exact termination date for the attached counterparties for physical and financial deals.  Can you help me with this?  Kam 
  Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?  Thanks Kam  x3-5781 
  Casey,  Barry Tycholiz, the west originator, has put a project in front of us.  I am working on this for gas, could you help with the power side, if you have any deals with these counterparties?  Thanks  Kam 
 Thanks,  I will forward this to Casey Evans to work on the Power side.  KK 
 Could you please each take a section of this spreadsheet and search tagg for any deals with these counterparties.  I need to know the exact counterparty name and if there are any deals with that counterparty for Nov-01 forward.  Thanks 
  Please let me know if any of this reqeuest can be done through CAS.  Thanks  Kam 
 Kim,  Are these physical or financial, or a combination.  Do you know the termination dates?  If not, I will try to get them from the confirmations group.  Thanks Kam 
 Thanks,  Will they also be doing those additional files that are not in the Netco directory?  KK 
  Sanjeev,  will you be here on Thursday and Friday?  I will need your help again with a dump of data before the weekend.  Thanks 
 This is what we have to look forward to.  We need to get all post-id's, for the live and bankruptcy books, and get those to Sanjeev Gupta to dump into excel.  Then try to tie those MTM values back to the Gross Book Balance we reported on the final NGP&L.  Once that ties, we will format the info to fit schedule B.  You can't wait, right? 
 Here you go. 
 Bob,  The estate DPR is ready and will be run on Wednesday and Monday mornings.  Thomas Underwood will be taking over that task from me.  Kam 
  Since you need this as of the 31st, we will have to get Zhiyong the post-id's after we calc. on Thursday and should have this ready to go early next week.  Is that early enough?  Kam 
 These are the official post-id's from Dec 31st for all live deals. We didn't have a "performance" book until January.   I included Canada and EMW at the bottom if needed.  Kam  Bankruptcy book 1452831 1452832 1452833 1452834 1452835 1452843 1452839 
 try this 
 Zhiyong,  We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.   Thanks  Kam 
 Sheet 3 has been updated (highlighted) for all TRV users.  I added the admin names in column H.  Thanks  KK 
 The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into? Is Canada doing their part?   Kam 
 Here is the gas DPR for last night.  You will start getting this on Wednesdays and Mondays.  Please tell me if this is what you need.  Thanks  Kam 
 Keith,  We are in the process of making new deal tickets for UBS and I would like to get your input.  Could you look at the attached ticket and delete, add or change anything you want to.  Everyone will be using this format for all non-EOL deals, one ticket per trade.  Thanks  Kam 
 Here is our final list of EOL products.   Thanks  Kam 
 Could you please add Derek Baily (dbailey) to the TDS and sitara access list?  Thanks KK 
 No problem. 
 After speaking with Kim Theriot in confirmations, we will not be using the RiskMantra entity, per the legal department.  All Canada to US deals should be booked ENA to ECC (using the new legal entities of course) rather than RiskMantra.  She is waiting on the final word about our new legal entity names, I will let you know what I hear.  Thanks  Kam 
 I am on the 5th floor.  05156.  See you then. 
 Dawn,  Please see the attached trader matrix template.  There were some changes made on the physical global id's.  Steve South was also added on the west desk.  Thanks  KK 
 Good question,  I think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade.  What do you think?  KK 
 Only inactivate those books that don't have a trader name next to it on the book request.  There are only a about 6 that should be inactivated.  KK 
 How about tomorrow morning at 9:30?  I have a meeting at 10:00 and I'm clear around that.  KK 
 That sounds good.  KK 
 Could you tell me what the new Rac website address will be and when it will be ready to use?  Thanks 
 I left a message with confirms....they should answer this for us. 
 Yes ma'am, same as before.  Thanks 
  There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files.  We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that.  I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.   KK 
 I created an Inactive Books folder in the Netco file for all currently unused books.   O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Inactive books  They are Texas2, Texas6, East4, East5, Cent4 and Cent5.  Thanks 
 Let Russ know also so he can break this up for TDS.  Have him create a roll up for South and Northwest and a total west that sums up both. 
 Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's the best news I've heard all day : ) 
 Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?   O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US Gas)_EOL new books.xls   Thanks  KK 
 Could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to GDM and GDY, rather than GDL and GDX.  Tell me how much trouble that is to change.  IT also made some changes to the physical org region names.  I will have to get you those changes.  Thanks
