roker quotes we get daily for each region.  I believe you had requested some curves so I also have the curves that were published for November 30th ready for you.  The files may be too large to send so please let me know if this is something you did request and I will get it to you.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 Yes, we are set.  Thanks 
 Those have been corrected.  They tagg pieces have been moved but demand charges were not deleted.  KK 
 Zhiyong,  These are the post-id's that we have pulled.  Showna and Debbie Brackett are trying to get the official post-id's from the system.  Once they get that, I will check them against these.  It is very possible that these won't be all of the correct id's but I wanted to get you something to start on.  Thanks  KK 
 Albert,  I spot checked a few of these and they are not all official.  Can you please list only the Nov 30th official post-id's?  I can't tell from your post-id sheets if I'm picking the correct ones.  Thanks 
 Yes,  Thanks 
 John,  There is a new book request in Controls\Book Request Form Central Canadian final.xls  Can you attach a code to these and send it off to global and Cecilia?  Thanks  Kam 
  Do you know what she is talking about.  Do you have to have a seperate book for futures and options for Crude, unleaded and Heating Oil??  KK 
 Looks like we need some new books set up.   Can you get with Phillip.  KK 
 Z,  These are the us gas Netco curves we would like to move over.  In columns G&H we have also provided you with the gas daily curve mappings for the new database.  Thanks  KK 
 Attached is the updated version of the new product/book assignments that I sent Torrey yesterday.  We are still unsure which books to attach the physical products to.  Let me know if you see any problems.  Thanks Kam 
 Thanks 
 Susan,  The performance book has been corrected by global counterparties.  Sorry to bother you.  KK 
 Can you please change the org regions for the attached books.  Thanks  Kam 
 Here are the curves loaded for East, Texas, West and Central on November 30th.  They are also saved in O:\_Dropbox\Kam\Nov 30 Curves if you need to make any changes. I left a copy of all broker quotes from that day on your desk.  All broker quotes are saved in O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Here are a few samples.       These are the curves for each region....basis, index, gas daily & physical. 
 Fixed. 
  Tracey,  We will have to change the org_region codes for all of our books today.  I will send you the updated book requests today once IT has agreed to the changes.  That should solve your problem.  Thanks  Kam

 I beleive this is what Zhiyong is looking for.  Let him know if you won't be ready by Friday.  Kam 
 Sorry, these have been fixed.  Thanks  KK 
 Torrey,  I added two columns to the right showing what the curve is now and what it should be.  We made some changes to the curve names to make them consistent.  Let me know if you need anything from me to make these changes.  Thanks  KK 
 Columns A-E are the exact names and their risk type.  Column G-H will be the mappings for the gas daily mappings.  If you can wait until the morning, I will have a more complete list for you.  We have made a few changes.  I will send it ASAP.  Thanks  Kam

 Thanks,  Will the test database be converted by Thursday?  We will be unable to verify that the deals are bridging correctly unless we can see the EOL reports.  Kam 
 Torrey,  Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  Hunter is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.
