e you didn't see this because of the fire wall, so I'm resending. 
 Is an RCR still necessary since Sue said Ron is doing this for Richard?  Tell me when you see me tomorrow. 
 Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.  I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:  In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits. San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially may be ordered." San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated. This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the Commission March 9 order. The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 order finding that it would not order cost based rates. This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and PX markets. 
 I E-mailed it to you.  Didn't you get it.? 
 I think we should do this but should include some comments praising FERC for taking some positive actions and really looking for solutions instead of simply ways to reregulate (thank you again Dan Yergin). 
 Marlene Huntsinger, Frank Afranji, Michele Farrell, and others too. 
 Please remind me to participate in Monday's RCR call. 
 Please draft an RCR for me on this.  Thanks.

 I'm fine with this.  The only other legal point you might make is that the request for longer than 60 days is a collateral attack on the FERC's December 15 order, and an issue that (if memory serves) is already before the FERC on rehearing.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows:  Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination. 
 As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to "Transmission Service" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 7.3, and 11.  Also "transmission service" should be capitalized.  Some Other suggestions:  Preamble - Sentence three - delete: "[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System."  Insert: "These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System."  Sentence four - delete "of the Transmission System"  Parts II and III are defined terms.  Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that "materially affect its interconnection" it can lose its place in the queue. Given how much discretion this gives PGE, "materially affect" should be a defined term or have a standard for its application.  Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows "The Interconnection Customer must execute, complete, and return  . . . "  Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures.  Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.  Section 3.4(iii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection.   Accordingly, Section (iii) should be changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.  Section 4.1 - When does the customer's responsibility to respond to higher-queued projects end?  Does this extend the 60-day period every time it happens?  Section 4.4  In sentence two - Delete "Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and"  Work the following definitions into Section 4.4: Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission line(s) to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice. Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system.  They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection.  In sentence three delete: modifications or additions to the Transmission Provider's transmission lines and substations and add "Network Upgrades."  Proof-read and correct section numbers.

 It's been a few years since I reviewed the case law on this.  Perhaps you should write a memo reviewing the FERC cases on this issue and if necessary, go talk to FERC about whether an RFP will be sufficient to set a just and reasonable rate.  Is that okay with you Jim?  Ron - how much would that cost?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 FYI 
 Please give me an estimate. 
 How much vacation/floating holiday time have I left, any?

 Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today. 
 Looks fine to me.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and PGE has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,  in the event PGE accepts our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing.  Is that okay?

 I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a "Suggestion of Bankruptcy" rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the debtor or the debtor's property.  Joe questioned whether the stay applies to our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the exercise of police and regulatory power.  According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of the stay.  He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.  I said it could be argued whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it violated the automatic stay.  He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file this "Suggestion of Bankruptcy."  * Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a "debtor in possession" and a trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code. 
 PG&E asked the FERC to establish cost-based pricing for all sales into California, and until the FERC makes a final determination on whether rates are just and reasonable, to subject all sales to a cost-based refund condition. 
 See attached pleading we are drafting.  The PX is seeking permission from the Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay to allow parties to continue this FERC case. 
 Off the top of my head, I belive several California parties did, but let me check.
