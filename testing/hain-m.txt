 Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also apply to the ISO Board's recent decision.

 I have tracked down an old memo written by the Chief Counsel of Federal Affairs for Niagara Mohawk, summarizing positions taken in requests for rehearing of Order No. 888 to close the bypass loophole.  She discusses how there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities' distribution systems in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them how much money they might lose if they couldn't figure out a way to recover these costs.  Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases involving New York utilities. 
 8. Q. Provide cumulative transaction volumes (million of Mwh) of electricity (by calendar quarter) for 1999 and 2000.  A.  EES transactions are included in EPMI transaction volumes.  Volumes for WSCC for 2000 are as follows:  1st qrtr 29,619 2nd qtr 44,617 3rd qtr 87,708 
 I think I know what you're talking about.  I know you weren't asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases).  In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee. Par. 31,036 at 31,797.  So in general, customers can't avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing.  FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.  Id. at 31,810. There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.  For contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision.  However, in that case, the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve.  Id. at note 679.  Accordingly, the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service. If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206 proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable, wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.  But, if they do, the incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.  Order No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,400.  Likewise, if the utility has already filed for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim in that case.  Id. The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred costs.  However, FERC will only entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required. Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.  I don't know anything about what the individual states have done.  I hope this helps. 
 This is getting rediculous.  Twenty four hours notice is simply not sufficient time to give us the notice required by the tariff.  Given the current barrage of data requests and confidentiality requests I hadn't even had time to read your E-mail when it was past time to respond.  Accordingly, Mike Day will be sending to FERC a request for confidential treatment.

 Concerning your Data Request to Generators #2, I believe this question was sent to us in error.  Enron Power Marketing does not own any generation in California, so these questions do not apply.  Please let me know if I have read the question incorrectly.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Per our phone call, here's one of the E-mails. 
 Brian - I''ll be on vacation next week so if you have any questions, please call my counterpart in Houston, Christi Nicolay.  Her E-mail address is above.  Her phone number is (713) 853-7007.  Christi will be pulling together the answer to data request number 8 for you for just the WSCC.  Christi - Chris is your contact person here to make sure the numbers are correct.      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Since you only wanted information for the WSCC, do you want the answer to number 8 to be corrected to only include information for the WSCC?  We don't have any information here about Enron Winds' generators.  I have forwarded your data requests to the following people at Enron Wind who I hope will be able to help you:  John Lamb, Michael Payne, and Hap Boyd.  Their addresses are: Michael Payne/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Hap Boyd/EWC/Enron@Enron, John Lamb/EWC/Enron@ENRON    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I'm sending you a series of E-mails from FERC asking for responses to data requests.  Please read them and call me with any questions: 503-464-8862 
 Many thanks!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I asked Chris to forward you this information in response to data request Number 8.  As I mentioned, before EPMI requests confidential treatment of this information.  This information is for the entire United States, not for the Western interconnect.  Please let us know if you need this information for just the Western Interconnect.  I will be in Washington DC for the next few days so if you need to reach me call me on my cell phone at 503-807-0929. 
 Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect.  If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday. Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on Monday, so if you call then, call my cell phone at 503 807-0929. 
 You requested the publicly available information underlying our slides, so you could independently verify Enron's conclusions.  If you have any other questions please call me.

 I assume you didn't see this because of the fire wall, so I'm resending. 
 Is an RCR still necessary since Sue said Ron is doing this for Richard?  Tell me when you see me tomorrow. 
 Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.  I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:  In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits. San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially may be ordered." San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated. This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the Commission March 9 order. The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 order finding that it would not order cost based rates. This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and PX markets. 
 I E-mailed it to you.  Didn't you get it.? 
 I think we should do this but should include some comments praising FERC for taking some positive actions and really looking for solutions instead of simply ways to reregulate (thank you again Dan Yergin). 
 Marlene Huntsinger, Frank Afranji, Michele Farrell, and others too. 
 Please remind me to participate in Monday's RCR call. 
 Please draft an RCR for me on this.  Thanks. 
 Mary Hain has resigned her position with Enron.  Please remove her from all mailing lists.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 please put on calendar 
 I'm fine with this.  The only other legal point you might make is that the request for longer than 60 days is a collateral attack on the FERC's December 15 order, and an issue that (if memory serves) is already before the FERC on rehearing.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows:  Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination. 
 As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to "Transmission Service" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 7.3, and 11.  Also "transmission service" should be capitalized.  Some Other suggestions:  Preamble - Sentence three - delete: "[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System."  Insert: "These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System."  Sentence four - delete "of the Transmission System"  Parts II and III are defined terms.  Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that "materially affect its interconnection" it can lose its place in the queue. Given how much discretion this gives PGE, "materially affect" should be a defined term or have a standard for its application.  Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows "The Interconnection Customer must execute, complete, and return  . . . "  Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures.  Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.  Section 3.4(iii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection.   Accordingly, Section (iii) should be changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.  Section 4.1 - When does the customer's responsibility to respond to higher-queued projects end?  Does this extend the 60-day period every time it happens?  Section 4.4  In sentence two - Delete "Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and"  Work the following definitions into Section 4.4: Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission line(s) to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice. Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system.  They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection.  In sentence three delete: modifications or additions to the Transmission Provider's transmission lines and substations and add "Network Upgrades."  Proof-read and correct section numbers. 
 FYI - Enron isn't already in the queue. 
 Could you send me the pro forma OATT and service agreement in electronic format?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 It's been a few years since I reviewed the case law on this.  Perhaps you should write a memo reviewing the FERC cases on this issue and if necessary, go talk to FERC about whether an RFP will be sufficient to set a just and reasonable rate.  Is that okay with you Jim?  Ron - how much would that cost?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today. 
 Looks fine to me.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and PGE has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,  in the event PGE accepts our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing.  Is that okay? 
 I like this better than Dan's original.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a "Suggestion of Bankruptcy" rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the debtor or the debtor's property.  Joe questioned whether the stay applies to our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the exercise of police and regulatory power.  According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of the stay.  He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.  I said it could be argued whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it violated the automatic stay.  He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file this "Suggestion of Bankruptcy."  * Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a "debtor in possession" and a trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code. 
 PG&E asked the FERC to establish cost-based pricing for all sales into California, and until the FERC makes a final determination on whether rates are just and reasonable, to subject all sales to a cost-based refund condition. 
 See attached pleading we are drafting.  The PX is seeking permission from the Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay to allow parties to continue this FERC case. 
 Off the top of my head, I belive several California parties did, but let me check.
