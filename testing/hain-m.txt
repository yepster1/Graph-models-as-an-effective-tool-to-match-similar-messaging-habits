e problem with each company/entity.  Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the FERC hotline on a confidential basis. 
 Tim alerted everyone about this.  It's just an average for each number. 
 The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement.  In the sixth "whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract states that either the generating company or the generating company's customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service.  In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed.  Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific.  For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service.  The eighth "Whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System (RMS) Agreement.  I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the "good utility" practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement.  Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.  I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard.  This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to form, BPA must agree to join.  Enron is very interested in RTO West forming. If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard.  Section 1.1  Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.  Rather, if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's open access tariff.  Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies.  The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT.  Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely  undermine the purpose of Order No. 888.  Section 1.2 After, "by both parties" add "however, if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT."  Section 1.6.2   Three years advance written notice is too long.  A reasonable notice period would be ____.  Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 EPMI opposes the definitions of "Applicable Laws" "Applicable Permits" and "Applicable Reliability Criteria" because, when combined with their use throughout the contract (in Sections 2.6, 3.5, 3.10, 3.11, 5.6.2, 5.6.3, 8.4.2, 11.8, E.2.8, E.3.3, E.4.1, E.4.3, E.4.4, and E.9.5) they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action.  Section 2.19 Section (i) of the definition of "Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for "the most reliable" supply.  Change "the most reliable" to "a reliable"  Section 2.31 Is inconsistent with Sierra's OATT.  It should be written using the same words as the OATT.  Section 2.52  The reference to Section 22.1 should be corrected to 21.1.  Section 2.56 Definition of "System Integrity" is too broad.  When combined with Section 3.13.2, it would require our generator to not "have an adverse impact on "maximiz[ing] the health, welfare, safety of personnel and the general public."  While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities, there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not.  Section 3.5 The proposed Use of "System Integrity" here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the "Good Utility Practice" standard.  Section 3.7 Shouldn't the word "unplanned" be added before the word Outages?  Section 3.8 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others.  Section 3.10 The second sentence exposes EPMI  to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI.    This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion.  Editorial note: the third to last sentence is missing a period.  Section 3.13.2 See comments under Section 2.56.  Section 4.1 EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract.  Accordingly, the words "or ordered by FERC" should be deleted.  EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra, with FERC's approval, to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierra's facilities  Section 4.3 Should the words "generating company's applicable FERC-approved tariff" be changed to "Applicable Law?"  Section 5.1.1 EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than 10 percent.  Under FERC's precedent, EPMI is only required to pay actual cost.  Section 5.1.3 Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice.  The words "plus Interest" should be added after the words "difference" in the fourth sentence.  Section 5.6.2 This section says essentially the same thing as Section 3.10 and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons.  Section 6.4.3 Add period at end of sentence.  Section 7.1 Delete period after the word "and" in last sentence.  Section 8.1.4 Add period after "Interconnection Facilities."  Section 8.4.2 EPMI opposes paying for all modi
