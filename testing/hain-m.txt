 Here is my idea for challenging the new ISO Board.  According to the trade press, one of the ISO Board's first actions will be to file with FERC to request more time to act on the FERC's requirement to file a market redesign.  We (or WPTF) would file a protest asking the FERC to reject the filing because the ISO does not have the authority to act. 
 It was derated by 3200 MW, raising Mid-Columbia prices by $50-75/MWh.  It's not effecting Cal ISO's return of power because that power is flowing on different transmission, from the Nevada Oregon Border north, not from the California Oregon border North. 
 Craig, - In addition, it is our understanding that the ISO has not cut transmission capacity to Southern California, although that action would have the same effect as cutting transmission to the north.  Jim - I have forwarded this information to Paul & Alan so they can pursue this issue with the Governors.  Could we also give this information to Clearing Up, if they promised not to quote us?  Do you think that would be helpful? 
 From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget.  The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that.  What do you think?  Call me. 
 I have drafted the attached letter denying the Cal ISO's request to send it (and the EOB) EPMI and EES' cost information for transactions over the FERC's cost cap.  Since I believe we are on very firm ground, my initial inclination was to send no response to the ISO's letter, so there would be nothing to quote in the press.  However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the message. 
 Christi - Cara has E-mailed a number of questions to Linda and Kelley.  If she doesn't hear from them by tomorrow morning, can Cara and I have a conference call with you at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so you can birddog people and get some answers?  In the meantime, if Cara E-mailed you the questions, would you answer any you know the answers to. Thanks.

 The Mercury News requested the CPUC subpoena.  What can we do to fight this (assuming there's anything we can do and we want to)? 
 Did Tim already send you these documents for your review?  If he did, have you been working with the Houston group on them or do you want to tell me about any problems? 
 I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join. 
 I sent this to my friend at FERC.  Souldn't we be opposing this? 
 Hi!  Hope all is well.  FYI - --   Subject:  AG suit to oust ISO Board  ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members  January 23, 2001 01-006 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  (SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the 26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers.  The "quo warranto" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation.  The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board.  Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing board pursuant to the new law.  The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and between neighboring states. 
 This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in? 
 I want verification from Tim, Chris Calger, and you that working on the RTO West tariff and generation interconnect agreement is consistent with my "new narrower role" as regulatory attorney for the West power desk and the apporpriate priority for use of my time.  Should I ask them now or should I wait until after we meet next week?

 The public power person who wrote the article Sean is discussing has always been opposed to RTO West and was just seizing another opportunity to oppose it.  The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no less committed for that reason.  In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO formation and control). 
 FYI.  Lysa can we talk about this? 
 Leslie, would you please put these numbers together for us?  Valerie said she would work with you on it.  Thanks. 
 I wonder if a court would give this any credence? 
 NPC still has not sent this. 
 See attached E-mail from Paul.  As Paul discusses a bunch of us in the West have not done internal resource reports since about September.  Anyway, in response to Paul's E-mail, I have done a report.  Does our group do these reports?  If so who puts together the report for our group? 
 As we discussed, here are some recent papers we have filed with FERC that will help you learn our positions and arguments on various issues, including price caps. 
 Christi said that Dan should work on this because he knows the history.  Jim approved it. Can you give me a budget amount?  Thanks. 
 Mary Hain will be attending dinner at Cucina Cucina    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you know we just got FERC to rule that marketers don't have to pay the annual charges.  Tim wants to protest.  Protests due 1/19!  Please respond ASAP.

 This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating on.  As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia.  I just found this out yesterday.  I will not be attending.  In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any comments on the paper as yet. 
 This looks fine.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Attached find the Cal ISO's Order No. 2000 filing.  It basically proposes nothing 
 I will also be in the TOA and maybe the Tariff review group.  Thanks.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this information with the ISO and EOB.  I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the conference call tomorrow. 
 Thanks you for the quick turn around.  I saw half a dozen typos but otherwise it looks good.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Do first thing. 
 What do you think?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Is EES asking for too much here (especially extending the rate freeze)? =20 Wouldn't it be better to get this thing resolved (assuming that's possible)= ? 
 I'd like to expand on the last point.  The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.

 I am back in the office.  I assume you are handling this and will let me see a copy of the draft.  Thanks. 
 According to the guys on the desk, EPMI has 5-10 end user customers in Montana (for example Smurfit, Stone and others). 
 I drafted the attached at Alan's request.  Alan, I hope it's close to what you had in mind. 
 FYI 
 Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons:  Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information necessary for refunds. We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals will not be achieved. Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell out-of-market without FERC scrutiny.

 Yes please.  Thanks. 
 Charles, I'm sorry I've taken so long to get back to you on this.  Since I didn't have time to analyze your paper, please see the attached paper on the release of information in an RTO.  Also, talk to Alan, I think he provided further support for our recommendations in an affidavit he filed at FERC. Also, please work with Alan about your comments on page 5.  Alan, if you respond through E-mails please copy me.  Thanks. 
 Joe Attached find the report you requested.  Alan - Governor Davis offered a highly discounted forward contract ($45-50/MWh) at the FERC settlement conference today.  As usual, California is trying to get its refund with or without FERC requiring it.  Alan - Tim and Joe will likely need your assistance with this settlement negotiation.

 I agree with Sue.  In fact, I don't even think we need to intervene given that the ISO did not file a tariff that would become effective.  So unless Tim wants to help out the ISO with a supportive filing . . . . 
 Is there anything we can do to address circumstances where we are required to bid into the ISO pursuant to the DOE's Section 202(c) order - especially for the fixed price customers? 
 Please review attached letter to customers ASAP.  Make sure you copy Steve Hall on your comments. 
 We have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.  We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts. The FERC should clarify its statement that "to the extent the IOUs' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules."  A literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity. Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs. We oppose the 27-month refund period We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF) The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being paid the cost of cover for exports 
 I have thrown together the following list of issues that people have raised so far:  Opportunity Costs under the soft cap $150 too low Benchmarks for Forward contracts Regulation of long term sales Preemption of PUC "buy" requirement Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power PUC's request for protective order

 Cool Christmas gift!  Thank you.  Attached is my feeble attempt at returning the favor. 
 I'd like to set up a call for this afternoon to discuss the FERC's order, in general.  Also, in an hour or so I'll also be forwarding a proposed issue list on rehearing so we can talk about it.

 FYI. Today we received the attached letter forwarded by Gary Fergus (our attorney on the California Attorney General investigation) from the California Attorney General.  This letter is a protocol for retaining electronic evidence. 
 Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and Richard will be discussing this this afternoon.  The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the ISO was viewed as cooperating. 
 FYI 
 As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati= ng=20 the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's= =20 Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio= n=20 that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein= =20 it stated that "MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we=20 suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specif= ic=20 market participants.  We encourage not only the Commission, but other law= =20 enforcement agencies as well, to use their authority to request from these= =20 market participants the necessary information to confirm whether these=20 suspicions about the exercise of significant market power are in fact=20 correct."  The MSC also stated that it "could provide a number of instances= =20 of what it suspects are suspicious bidding and scheduling behavior during t= he=20 summer and Autumn of 2000."  Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:  The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because= =20 FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request i= s=20 a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for= =20 its investigation in this case.  Further, it would allow Edison to access= =20 this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying= =20 marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal= =20 opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs). In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery= =20 rights and establish an appropriate protective order. There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authori= ty=20 by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the=20 deliberative process privilege.  Gary Fergus suggested this argument.  Not= =20 having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.  Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference= =20 call on this?  Jim suggested that we should try to have WPTF file this answ= er=20 and I agreed.  At first, I was thinking that it would be okay for Ron to=20 draft the answer for WPTF.  However, on further consideration, if we end up= =20 wanting to argue that another member of WPTF exercised market power,=20 Bracewell would have a conflict of interest that would prohibit it from=20 representing us.  Accordingly, WPTF should use other counsel.

 I'm not sure whether we want Hoecker to make the fourth point.  What do others think? 
 I will not be attanding this meeting as I understand you both will be.  I'm sure we have many other specific concerns (and I am reviewing the amended supplemental compliance filing as I'm sure you are).  However, I think our key concern is returning to a stakeholder process.  Since the utilities first filing, we haven't been allowed to be at the table.  This violates Order No. 2000.

 Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today:  How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price?  I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268. 
 Here are my corrections/concerns/questions about the EPMI portion of the filing.  We need to coordinate this with PGE and Enron Wind and make sure they file to revise their tariffs and agree to the change of the code of conduct.  Are you handling that Sarah or do you want me to? The filing and tariff do not include the Commission approved FTR sales into California, that needs to be added. Do we have any idea how close the SEC is to ruling?  It's my recollection that FERC does not like indefinite notice periods, as we have requested, nor, under their rules, do they permit a notice period of longer than 120 days. Has counsel looked at whether FERC has made special exceptions for mergers?

 On 10/27/00, FERC issued two orders that clarify procedures for requesting long term transmission.  (Morgan Stanley v. Ill. Powerand Tenaska Power v. SPP).  In both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) transmission service and in both cases, the ATC was insufficient to award the entire request.  Transmission Providers, Ill. Power and SPP treated partial service differently.  In these orders FERC holds:  A transmission provider (TP) is NOT required to offer short term service in response to a long term request.  Section 19.7 of the pro forma OATT only obligates the TP to tell the customer how much partial Long Term service could be provided.  Examples: -- Customer requests 300 MW long term transmission service for one year.  TP replies that it can offer 200 MW for the entire year. -- Customer requests 2 year service for 300 MW.  TP replies that it can offer 300 MW for one year. -- Customer requests 300 MW for one year.  TP can only provide 300 MW for summer months.  TP is NOT obligated to provide customer the 3 months service.  Furthermore, an annual request for 300 for some months and 0 MW for others is NOT a valid long term request.  What Customer is then doing is really submitting a short term request for 300 for summer only -- a new short term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.  While the TP is not required to respond with short term availability in response to a long term request, FERC did footnote to Ill. Power that it thinks it is a helpful idea for the TP to alert the customer to what ATC is available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes. 
 Diana - are you tracking this? 
 We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric. My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, at least if their transmission is in RTO West. 
 Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and outside counsel on it.  I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of  Bracewell and Patterson for one project.  Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  The Commission has 60 days to accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or the filing is deemed accepted.  EWG applications are made under Section 32 of the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act.  Thereunder, the Commission must make an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.

 I have tracked down an old memo written by the Chief Counsel of Federal Affairs for Niagara Mohawk, summarizing positions taken in requests for rehearing of Order No. 888 to close the bypass loophole.  She discusses how there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities' distribution systems in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them how much money they might lose if they couldn't figure out a way to recover these costs.  Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases involving New York utilities. 
 8. Q. Provide cumulative transaction volumes (million of Mwh) of electricity (by calendar quarter) for 1999 and 2000.  A.  EES transactions are included in EPMI transaction volumes.  Volumes for WSCC for 2000 are as follows:  1st qrtr 29,619 2nd qtr 44,617 3rd qtr 87,708 
 I think I know what you're talking about.  I know you weren't asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases).  In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee. Par. 31,036 at 31,797.  So in general, customers can't avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing.  FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.  Id. at 31,810. There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.  For contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision.  However, in that case, the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve.  Id. at note 679.  Accordingly, the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service. If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206 proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable, wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.  But, if they do, the incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.  Order No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,400.  Likewise, if the utility has already filed for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim in that case.  Id. The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred costs.  However, FERC will only entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required. Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.  I don't know anything about what the individual states have done.  I hope this helps. 
 This is getting rediculous.  Twenty four hours notice is simply not sufficient time to give us the notice required by the tariff.  Given the current barrage of data requests and confidentiality requests I hadn't even had time to read your E-mail when it was past time to respond.  Accordingly, Mike Day will be sending to FERC a request for confidential treatment.

 Concerning your Data Request to Generators #2, I believe this question was sent to us in error.  Enron Power Marketing does not own any generation in California, so these questions do not apply.  Please let me know if I have read the question incorrectly.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Per our phone call, here's one of the E-mails. 
 Brian - I''ll be on vacation next week so if you have any questions, please call my counterpart in Houston, Christi Nicolay.  Her E-mail address is above.  Her phone number is (713) 853-7007.  Christi will be pulling together the answer to data request number 8 for you for just the WSCC.  Christi - Chris is your contact person here to make sure the numbers are correct.      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Since you only wanted information for the WSCC, do you want the answer to number 8 to be corrected to only include information for the WSCC?  We don't have any information here about Enron Winds' generators.  I have forwarded your data requests to the following people at Enron Wind who I hope will be able to help you:  John Lamb, Michael Payne, and Hap Boyd.  Their addresses are: Michael Payne/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Hap Boyd/EWC/Enron@Enron, John Lamb/EWC/Enron@ENRON    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I'm sending you a series of E-mails from FERC asking for responses to data requests.  Please read them and call me with any questions: 503-464-8862 
 Many thanks!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I asked Chris to forward you this information in response to data request Number 8.  As I mentioned, before EPMI requests confidential treatment of this information.  This information is for the entire United States, not for the Western interconnect.  Please let us know if you need this information for just the Western Interconnect.  I will be in Washington DC for the next few days so if you need to reach me call me on my cell phone at 503-807-0929. 
 Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect.  If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday. Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on Monday, so if you call then, call my cell phone at 503 807-0929. 
 You requested the publicly available information underlying our slides, so you could independently verify Enron's conclusions.  If you have any other questions please call me.

 Congrats and best of luck always!  It couldn't happen to a nicer guy. 
 I assume you didn't see this because of the fire wall, so I'm resending. 
 Is an RCR still necessary since Sue said Ron is doing this for Richard?  Tell me when you see me tomorrow. 
 Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.  I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:  In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits. San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially may be ordered." San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated. This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the Commission March 9 order. The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 order finding that it would not order cost based rates. This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and PX markets. 
 I E-mailed it to you.  Didn't you get it.? 
 I think we should do this but should include some comments praising FERC for taking some positive actions and really looking for solutions instead of simply ways to reregulate (thank you again Dan Yergin). 
 Marlene Huntsinger, Frank Afranji, Michele Farrell, and others too. 
 Please remind me to participate in Monday's RCR call. 
 Please draft an RCR for me on this.  Thanks.

 please put on calendar 
 I'm fine with this.  The only other legal point you might make is that the request for longer than 60 days is a collateral attack on the FERC's December 15 order, and an issue that (if memory serves) is already before the FERC on rehearing.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows:  Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination. 
 As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to "Transmission Service" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 7.3, and 11.  Also "transmission service" should be capitalized.  Some Other suggestions:  Preamble - Sentence three - delete: "[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System."  Insert: "These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System."  Sentence four - delete "of the Transmission System"  Parts II and III are defined terms.  Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that "materially affect its interconnection" it can lose its place in the queue. Given how much discretion this gives PGE, "materially affect" should be a defined term or have a standard for its application.  Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows "The Interconnection Customer must execute, complete, and return  . . . "  Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures.  Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.  Section 3.4(iii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection.   Accordingly, Section (iii) should be changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.  Section 4.1 - When does the customer's responsibility to respond to higher-queued projects end?  Does this extend the 60-day period every time it happens?  Section 4.4  In sentence two - Delete "Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and"  Work the following definitions into Section 4.4: Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission line(s) to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice. Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system.  They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection.  In sentence three delete: modifications or additions to the Transmission Provider's transmission lines and substations and add "Network Upgrades."  Proof-read and correct section numbers. 
 FYI - Enron isn't already in the queue. 
 Could you send me the pro forma OATT and service agreement in electronic format?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 It's been a few years since I reviewed the case law on this.  Perhaps you should write a memo reviewing the FERC cases on this issue and if necessary, go talk to FERC about whether an RFP will be sufficient to set a just and reasonable rate.  Is that okay with you Jim?  Ron - how much would that cost?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 FYI 
 Please give me an estimate. 
 How much vacation/floating holiday time have I left, any?

 Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today. 
 Looks fine to me.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and PGE has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,  in the event PGE accepts our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing.  Is that okay? 
 I like this better than Dan's original.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a "Suggestion of Bankruptcy" rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the debtor or the debtor's property.  Joe questioned whether the stay applies to our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the exercise of police and regulatory power.  According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of the stay.  He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.  I said it could be argued whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it violated the automatic stay.  He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file this "Suggestion of Bankruptcy."  * Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a "debtor in possession" and a trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code. 
 PG&E asked the FERC to establish cost-based pricing for all sales into California, and until the FERC makes a final determination on whether rates are just and reasonable, to subject all sales to a cost-based refund condition. 
 See attached pleading we are drafting.  The PX is seeking permission from the Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay to allow parties to continue this FERC case. 
 Off the top of my head, I belive several California parties did, but let me check.
