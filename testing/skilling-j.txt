eryone else - the pledges Jeff has received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 hours!  SRS 
 Dear David,  Jeff will see your e-mail later today and will respond to your first question as soon as possible.  In the meantime, I'm attaching Jeff's current bio in response to your second question.    Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Thank you, Rod!  SRS 
 Thanks for the message, Tom.  I have visited the Ivory Coast, Togo and Nigeria once;  Tanzania twice; and Kenya and So. Africa three times.  I really love the place and look forward to spending lots more time there.  Thanks, too, for sharing the photos.  Jeff 
 Sam, Jeff said he would be happy to talk with you.  Just look for him in LaGrange late Saturday afternoon.  Good luck on the ride!  SRS 
 How much to you have?!  SRS 
 $50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you. Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS    Enron Energy Services 
 Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS 
 I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!  Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?  Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...  Sherri :-) 
 Stan, Jeff will be travelling the biggest portion of May.  Would you let us know the next time Ali is in the US and I will try to work something out for them to meet.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Gentlemen,  Messrs. Micheal Holthouse and Matt Khourie (Jeff's co-hosts of the April 24 YPO event) invite you to join them at dinner on Monday evening, April 23. Reservations have been made in Matt Khourie's name at Capital Grille, located at 5365 Westheimer Road (in the Galleria area), at 7:00 p.m.  Should you need transportation to the restaurant, I will be happy to make those arrangements for you.

 Greetings, Tom.  I have a great picture of you, Jeff and Jeffrey at the Inauguration that Jeff asked me to send to you.  Unfortunately, I don't have a mailing address for you.  If you would please e-mail me your address, I'll get the picture right out to you.  Thanks, and hope all is well!  SRS 
 Jeff (Rocky) Skilling is not able to attend the football game, but he appreciates you offering to get him a ticket.  He will, however, be at Elvis' party Friday night.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Jeff Skilling asked me to send you his new e-mail address.  It is: jeff.skilling@enron.com.  Please let us know if you need any additional information.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) jeff.skilling@enron.com 
 Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your patience.  SRS 
 Diomedes, I have been searching high and low for this information for you, and I think I may have found something.  I have a letter from you to Jeff dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of $110,109.00.  It broadly outlines expenses and references an attached report, which I unfortunately do not have.  Would this letter be of any help to you? Please let me know, and I'll be happy to send it right to where ever you designate.  SRS 
 Thanks for the update, Andrew.  Just let us know if what the ultimate outcome is.  SRS 
 Hamd, would you take the lead on this and keep Jeff posted?  Thanks, SRS 
 Dear Mr. Thornton,  We are in receipt of your letter to Jeff Skilling dated March 30, 2001.  Jeff has been traveling for the past 2 weeks; however, I wanted you to know that your letter was received and that you will receive a response as soon as practical.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I may be of further assistance.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Gentlemen,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling regarding scheduling a 20-minute conference call to discuss the above referenced presentation/panel discussion at the Houston Chapter YPO (Young Presidents Organization) meeting.  Jeff is available the afternoon of Thursday, April 12, between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. (CDT).  Please let me know what your availability is during this time period, and I'll be back in touch to nail down an exact time or to suggest an alternative date/time.  Thank you very much for your commitment to this event and for your patience in awaiting the details.  I look forward to hearing from each of you soon.  Best regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com  Sent to: David Arnoff, Greylock Kevin Compton, KPCB Team Partners John Thornton, Austin Ventures 
 Thank you for the invitation.  Mr. Skilling will be travelling on the 19 and therefore unable to attend.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713-345-7774 713-646-8381 joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the SUN demonstration.  With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.  I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.

 George, I didn't hear back from you, but I think I found the correct zip code - hopefully it's 77036.  I'm sending yours and Paco's tickets via courier, so you should received them by +/- 2:00p today.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 sherri.sera@enron.com 
 David, just heard that you joined the 2001 Enron MS150 team - congratulations!  Look forward to seeing you out at Tully Stadium on the 20th.  Jeff 
 Thank you for your e-mail.  I have taken the liberty of forwarding your information to Cindy Olson, Executive VP of HR.  You may contact Cindy directly at 713-853-7418.  Thanks, Joannie Williamson Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713-345-7774 713-646-8381 (fax) joannie.williamson@enron.com 
 Thanks for the heads up, Micheal.  We're working to track down the source and remove it.  We really appreciate you bringing it to our attention.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 
 How about 9:00 a.m. on the 9th?  Bill Donovan will join in on the tour.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Can you do lunch on Thursday?  Just for fun, but to also pick your brain about roses.  Joannie 
 Christie, do Sherri or I need to do anything to send the survey from Jeff's e-mail?  Thanks, Joannie 
 Stan,  Per Jeff's request, I have forwarded the resume you attached to Philippe Bibi, President & CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Jeff would be interested in a tour of the building.  Would if the afternoon of May 8, at 3:30 would work for your schedule.  At Jeff's request, I plan on including Bill Donovan.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Kristin will not be riding.  Thanks, Joannie 
 April 25 would be the only day that may work for Jeff.  Please advise.  Thanks, Joannie 
 Amelia, where can I pick Jeff's rider package for the MS150?  Thanks, Joannie 
 Kristin, I have it on the calendar for Friday, October 13.  I also left Friday, November 10 on the calendar, too.  I'll check with him about meeting you vs. picking you up and let you know what he says.  Hope your having a good day - see you Saturday night.  SRS 
 Some people said they didn't get this, so here it is again! 
 Mr. Compton,  This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.  I will be in touch with you soon to schedule a phone call with Jeff.  Regard, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Ms. Robinson,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, to whom Kay Cole introduced to you via e-mail.  He would like to speak to you by phone regarding his daughter Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.  Would you be willing to provide us with your phone number?  Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your future visits to Houston.  I looking forward to hearing from you soo
