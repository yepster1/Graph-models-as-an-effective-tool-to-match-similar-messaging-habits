 Awais,  Mr. Skilling receives this report every day, which he is very interested in= =20 seeing; however, especially when traveling, he is most interested in the=20 summary e-mail, not the lengthy attached document.  I print this page for him everyday and fax it to him if traveling. =20 Unfortunately, there appears to be something in the margins that prevents t= he=20 "To Date" column from printing.  Could you check into this and let me know = if=20 there is something we can do to make certain that the entire e-mail page=20 prints?  Thanks for your assistance.  SRS 
 Mr. Buttrey,  I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling in response to your note below.  Jeff would be delighted to join you for lunch on your visit to Houston.  In looking at this schedule, he is currently available for lunch on the following dates:  May 16, 19 May 24, 25  Please let us know which, if any, of these dates work best for you.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Mr. Paul,  Jeff asked me to see if I could find out when the Homecoming is taking place.  He'd like to be there if the dates work with his schedule.  Thank you, Sherri Sera Assistant toJeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Chuck,  Thank you for the information.  I have marked the dates on Jeff's calendar, and he plans to be there.  I guess he'll get more information as the date draws closer?  Regards, Sherri 
 Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to pick you up.  Have a good time.  SRS 
 Hi again, Kristin.  Just wanted to make sure you received my e-mail yesterday about meeting your Dad at Grotto (on Westheimer) at 1:00p.  Send me a note back and let me know, ok?  Thanks, SRS 
 Kristin - you're right!  I didn't realize you and your Dad had talked this morning.  Sorry for the confusion!  SRS 
 Forgot to ask you to let me know when you get the message!  SRS 
 Dear John,  On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not before Jeff saw a printed copy.  Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will pursue this opportunity.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  Regards, Sherri Sera on behalf of Jeff Skilling 
 Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...  Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa and getting the required shots.  Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a while?  Sherri 
 Amelia, I was able to collect the remainder of the pledges ($5,140).  Please let me know where you are located, and I'll try to get it over there today. If you happen to be in the building and want to stop by, that's fine, too. Katherine knows where it is if I'm not at my desk.  SRS 
 test worked!  Jeff is out of town today, so I'm responding on his behalf.  SRS 
 Hello, Mike.  11:30 still works for Jeff.  Why don't you meet him at the Enron Building (1400 Smith Street) - I think you had mentioned that you wanted a quick tour.  You'll have to check in at the security desk in our lobby; I'll make sure they know that you are expected so they'll give you a visitor badge and send you to the 50th floor.  I'm not sure yet where Jeff plans to take you for lunch - anything in particular you like?  SRS 
 Thank you for the invitation to Mr. Skilling.  Unfortunately, he has a family commitment that will prevent his participation.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Kevin,  Jeff's response to this inquiry is:  "No - just a social visit - he seems to be trying to make it soound like something very different."  Hope this helps - call if you need clarification.  Thanks, SRS 
 Dear Mr. Ryan,  We are in receipt of your letter to Mr. Skilling regarding CallTech Communications contact center services.  Mr. Skilling has forwarded your correspondence to Mr. Chris Reedy, Director of Customer Satisfaction at Enron Energy Services. Upon review, Mr. Reedy will contact you if appropriate.  Sincerely, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Mike, we appreciate you keeping Jeff in the loop for the 2001 U.S. Open. However, Jeff is not a golfer and has decided to decline this invitation. Thank you for the offer. Katherine for Jeff Skilling 
 Per our phone conversation, you may cancel this service for Jeff Skilling. Thanks, SRS 
 Karen, Jeff is traveling today.  Is this the type of release that I should try to get to him before it goes out?  Please advise.  RS 
 This is correct.  SRS 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.

 Pam, I was going through Jeff's email and found this.  See below - it looks like this went to Catherine Brown of EES (my name is with a "K").  It looks like Jeff would be available from 2:00 to 3:00.  I will put it on his calendar to attend for one hour.  Is that good for you? Katherine 
 Mr. Skilling will not attend as he will be travelling. Thank you, Katherine Brown 
 Scott, Mr. Skilling with be out of the office on Monday, November 20. Best wishes for a productive meeting with Charle Reese. Katherine Brown 
 Mr. Hobby,  Jeff Skilling and Rebecca Carter will stop by your open house Wednesday.  He does have his children early evening, so they will probably arrive after 7:30 p.m.  Please let me know if you need additional information.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 yes! 
 Karen, unfortunately, Jeff will be unable to review this prior to release; however, I noticed that Joe Hirko is listed as "chairman and CEO."  It is my understanding that he is "CEO" only and does not carry the "chairman" title. You might want to double-check.  Thanks, SRS 
 Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe it has already come and gone!  Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it in the mail to:  Sherri Sera c/o Enron Corp. P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX 77251-1188 U.S.A.  Thanks and take care, Sherri 
 The ponytail, tattoo and the beard were gone when he showed up last Monday. I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS 
 Bert, will you please e-mail me Gene's exact title.  Thanks, SRS 
 Liz, would you please e-mail me Greg's exact title.  Thanks, SRS 
 Thank you for the information, Mr. Haack.  For your information, Jeff does have a Federal Reserve Bank board meeting on the morning of Thursday, September 20, 2001, but we are holding the afternoon of 9/20/01 through 9/22/01 for you.  I look forward to hearing from you with more details in the coming months.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Dear Ms. Kurz,  I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment.  With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the information may be sent to:  Jeffrey K. Skilling President & COO Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB5007 Houston, TX  77002  Thank you for your consideration.  We look forward to hearing from you again soon.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 e-mail: sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Hello, Mark.  The person you can speak to at Enron is Eric Shaw=20 (44.207.783.5408) - he heads up that part of Europe out of our London=20 office.  By copy of this e-mail, I'm letting him know to expect your call.  Glad to hear all is well.  Good luck with your project!  SRS 
 Mr. Knapp,  Thank you for your invitation to Mr. Skilling to speak at the March 22, 2000, Energy Industry Restructuring seminar in Paris.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling's schedule does not allow him to participate.  Sincerely, Sherri Reinartz-Sera Assistant to Mr. Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
 Charla, Jeff said this is acceptable to him.  Thanks, SRS 
 Please note changes below for Jeff and Jeffrey Skilling. 
 Johnathan,  My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is something they would like to do.  I appreciate your assistance in this matter.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Steve, thanks for the note.  It was great to meet you.  I look forward to seeing more of you in the future.  Regards, Jeff 
 I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there.  Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Benjamin,  Just a short note to thank you for taking the time and effort to give me some of your ideas.  Believe it or not, we're working these exact issues right now.  Thanks very much for your input.  Regards, Jeff 
 Charlene, I'm sending down the letter Benjamin sent to Jeff with some ideas about improving morale in the program, which was referenced in the e-mail I bcc'd you on a moment ago.  SRS 
 Beek,  Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Jeff Skilling will be there - thanks for the offer.  Regards, Sherri Sera 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Blake, I've reserved one of our Falcon 900s for the trip, too.  It seats 12 passengers.  Please let me know departure time on 10/20, and return time on 10/23 when that has been determined.  Thanks, SRS 
 Cindy, I saw this in Jeff's email.  Is there any information we can have so that Jeff can make a contribution if he chooses to? Katherine 
 Elvis,  I cannot open this document either.  I wonder if you could fax it to Rocky at 713.646.8381.  Thank  you, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Ladies and gentlemen of Class #64,  Jeff Skilling has reserved Drayton McLane's suite at Enron Field for the October 1 (last game of the regular season) Astros game against the Milwaukee, and he would like you to be his guests.  First pitch is scheduled at 7:05p.  Please let me know if you are able to join him.  If you do plan to attend, please let me know the most convenient way to get a ticket to you.  Don't hesitate to call me should you have any questions.  I look forward to a positive response.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com  PS - if there is anyone from Class #64 that is not on this e-mail distribution, please forward a copy to them. 
 Thanks for the e-mail, Nasim.  We're working on a variation of it now.  Keep up the good work.  Jeff 
 Mark, Jeff asked me to let you know that John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe, is expecting your call pursuant to the voicemail and letter you sent.  John is very anxious to talk to you.  He can be reached in London at 44.207.783.6522.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Regards, Sherri 
 Roxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited. I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!  I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.  That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to the football game Saturday.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Rocky 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Tamara, was Jeff Skilling copied on this e-mail in error or is there something I should be doing?  It means nothing to me, but will be happy to follow up on it  if necessary.  Thanks.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Shouldn't have responded so quickly!  Thanks for the clarification.  Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com 
 Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I think we have some flexibility on that and am checking it out.  I'll be back in touch as soon as I've resolved that.  SRS 
 Patti, can you believe that out of all those dates you offered that Jeff is only available on October 14?!  I have penciled it in on his calendar as has Rebecca.  We'll look forward to more details.  Thanks, and have a wonderful time in Cabo!  I'm so envious!!!  Sherri
