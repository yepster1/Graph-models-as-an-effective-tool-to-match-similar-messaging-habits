1-22.  Off-peak was the same as yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules. 
 Jeff, I fax the ecar hourly price index again for the 19th.  I did forget to put "attn:  bobette" on the fax to her. 
 SERC  A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and SCEG will be on the bid.  SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5    FRCC  Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought $21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a decision on any b.o.d preschedules.  FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 68.8  OFFER $ 139.7

 FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12. For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35. DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.

 SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00. SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the North could not flow to SERC.

ERCOT-  For Saturday bids were in the low to mid 30's.  Offers were in the high 40's(CSW and HLP) to mid 50's(TU).  We sold the City of GARLAND $54 for he 23 and 24.  Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these hours.

 Please e-mail the policies that you consider too conservative.  If these issues affect your own personel life, then you have big problems.  Just keep in mind that your family lineage is very conservative.  And please remember that I supported G.W. "frat boy" Bush.

 This is 80% true.  You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF: ? 1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids. 2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name. 3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata. 4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children. 5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer. 6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight. 7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing. 8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting. 9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra. 10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice. 11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready. 12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!" 13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid. 14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00." 15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped. 16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party. 17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool. 18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes. 19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake. 20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake. 21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior. 22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box. 23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy. 24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby. 25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party. ? Power to la Raza ? I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........  ?
