 important to our closing this year's deal if TCEM can't come up with the corp. guarantee.  I.e., if we can retain absolute control of the noms, do we really have any "go physical" risk???  We need to think this through.  DF 
 Denise, pls print for me.  Thanks DF 
 For some reason the initial email didn't go through to him--I forwarded it separately.  Thanks.  DF 
 I'm on board with the low key concept and the bullets look great.  Some minor comments attached.  Thanks for spearheading this, Shelley.  DF 
 Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the ENA deal guys.  More to follow. 
 I couldn't get the email through to Bill Gang, so lets try William.  Bill V, if this doesn't show Bill G as an addressee, please forward from your computer.  Thanks.  DF 
 Approved on behalf of Dari.  The attached document has the dates right--its Nov. 29, 2000 through Dec. 31, 2000.  DF 
 I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that he was in the middle of a "big drafting project"--revising Dennis' joint venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board. I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF 
 DJ, Drew was scheduled to attend May 25th @ 2 p.m. but will not be able attend as he has an important conference call.  Carmen 
 I'll be in Houston so no need to dial me in!  DF 
 I saw in the press that N.M. has delayed electric open access until Jan 1, 02 for residentials and small commercials and to July 1, 02 for large industrials.  That increases the likelihood that the Pueblo project will have to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail markets start to open up.  One more thing to factor in.  I'm expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to talk about Langley's "sole source" procurement strategy with DOE.  I hope to get Votaw on the phone with Langley's D.C. govt. contracts lawyers to discuss their theory.  We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole source strategy is really a high risk approach.  I'm not sure where that would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE into opening the power plant up for bids.  Langley does not appear interested in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning.  Once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions (potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland outsourcing strategy) and ENA.  The ENA involvement would be particularly important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the specifications/economics that would result.  I'm probably engaging in wishful thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics from the model that James ran.   If we think this thing is a potentially viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team, we need to grab Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA "from the bottom up," or through Stan "from the top down" to get hooked into a deal team over there.  Kevin, I still intend to hook you into the Votaw-DC call if you are available. Thanks. DF 
 I second that--thanks a lot!!  DF 
 pls get me scheduled on this.  thanks. df 
 Another Tino-gram.  DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge.  Tino didn't know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak usage, or what.  The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of "demand above 10,000kw during peak period"  (peak period is daytime) so I assume that is how it is calculated.  If that is the tariff ("Schedule 4000B") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.  It is also interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh.  This is not as good as the 7 cent number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible.  If the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is $.0576/kwh.  Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm these numbers.  That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you and I talked about yesterday, Kevin.  Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the Cobisa Belen project is dead.  Do we know anything about this??? Interesting.  I'm waiting to hear back from Bill Votaw to line up a due diligence call to Tino's government contracts lawyers in DC to confirm whether the "sole source" strategy is legit.  Kevin, I'll let you know when this is scheduled in case you want to be on the call.  Thanks.  DF 
 I wouldn't miss it!  DF

 Please give me a call ASAP on marketing affiliate issue on TW Enron Online deal.  Cell 402-630-8461 or home 402-572-8595.  I'm in tomorrow around 7:45. Gracias.  DF 
 Tino implied that it was transferrable, but we'd need to look at the documents to be surre.  DF 
 At the suggestion of Robert Jones (you remember him--one of the growing legion of ex-GPG HR representatives), I interviewed a lady named Emma Caplan yesterday.  She is the wife of a guy that Enron Networks brought over to Houston from London.  She is a "Solicitor" in the English legal system, and got her law degree at the University of Wales.  She has not taken an American bar exam but may be able to take DC or New York.  For some reason related to practice of foreign lawyers in TX, she can't take the TX bar until she has gotten a US law degree.  This person is very bright, personable, and enthusiastic.  She is extremely interested in working for Enron, either as a lawyer once she gets her license squared away, or in a paralegal or analyst position until then. I left a copy of her resume with Emily, and I'd ask that she please forward it to each of you.  If any of you have need for such an individual or have ideas she should pursue within Enron (or outside Enron), please call Robert or myself.  Thanks.  DF 
 I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion.  I was pretty impressed with her.  The only down side is that her inability to sit for the Texas bar is a hangup for a lawyer position.   I suggested that she also look into getting her license in New York or D.C. as I think those jurisdictions are less reluctant to allow non-U.S. lawyers to sit for the bar than Texas is.  I'll talk to Mike Moran, Dot McCoppin, Britt Davis and Shelley Corman regaring possible positions in GPG.  Have you thought about Steve Kean's group?  They might be able to use someone like Emma.  I plan to write her in a couple of weeks to follow up with any additional leads I've found.  Enjoyed shootin the shit with you, as always!  DF 
 If we are still talking about 6-1, any time after 1 should work for me, as I've got a meeting that ends at 11:30 downtown.  How long does it take to drive to Katy at noon???  About 3 hours?  DF 
 I couldn't open the document, but that's OK as I will have no problem with whatever form and content you include, as long as they don't build in any links to porno sites or similar undesirable places.  Thanks. DF 
 If you guys are just going to squabble like a couple of old ladies I'm not sure I want to play golf with you!  By the way, Hill, your excuse is lame.  DF 
 I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque.  DOE indicated that their current PNM rate is "5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."  Tino's consultant claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of approximately 7 cents/KWh.  Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh.  This is at the high end of the range we hoped they'd be in.  Additionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don't want to rely on PNM for back up power.  They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines.  The new pipeline will need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse supplies and guard against supply failure.  They have not asked for fuel oil backup.  I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the power price number looks very promising to me.  I think its worth scrubbing down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine configuration we'd be using.  If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest? DF 
 I enjoyed meeting with you guys and your team this morning.  Our crack certificate people have already responded to my request, as you'll see below.  As you get deeper into the process, talking with Michele and her colleagues may be useful for you as they have been through it all before with FERC on storage projects.  Let me know if I can be of further help.  Thanks for the quick help, Michele.  DF 
 Thanks for the offer!  Lets see when we get this event scheduled and I may be able to take you up on it.  Looks like you Utilicorp guys need to get coordinated or I may have to play golf twice.  That would be brutal.  DF 
 How about Thursday or Friday, June 1 or 2 for a round of golf?  I'm in HOU all wk and the end of the wk looks pretty light.  I'd be happy to venture out west to your Katy/San Antonio nick of the woods if you guys are available. Hill, are you gonna be in Houston around then?  If so, can you sneak the clubs past your wife?  Please advise.  DF  PS:  I met with Paul Bieniawski and his new storage group today.  Do you guys know how he parted terms with the Frogs? 
 No problem with the plan to send a demand letter to El Paso on the measurement issue.  Please include me on distribution for the draft. Thanks,  DF 
 Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF 
 I'm forwarding to each of you a fascinating document--Langley's proposal to the DOE.  It looks like he's already been fairly specific about the interest that the tribes will have in the various entities and contracts.  He also promised DOE a 10 % power cost reduction (before he even knew what they were currently paying).  He may have made some promises that are pretty to hard to deliver on.  Developers are amazing.  DF

 I'm OK with the language, but I want to make sure everyone is OK on the concept.  When we left this (unless there have been subsequent conversations with ECS that I wasn't a part of) we rejected Courtney's proposal to reduce our up front payment by $500,000.  He was to come back and propose a monthly quantity of gas to be paid over the term of the contract that would equate to the $500,000, but I don't recall that we agreed to it.  Did we intend to leave the issue open for more horsetrading on the amount of a haircut ECS should take or were we content to cover ECS at 100 cents on the dollar?  I am advised that the Btu number in the letter would allow ECS to get the full $500,000 of up front value.  Rod and Steve--this one is up to you and I think its totally a question of whether we want to argue for some more $$ because I can't think of any other open issue with ECS on this or any other deals that we might be able to trade.    DF 
 I'm in.  df    Enron North America Corp. 
 cool.  Thanks. DF 
 Shoot.  Due to a conflict on Monday, I'm now scheduled to arrive in Houston on Tuesday at 10 am.  I return to Omaha at 8 PM  on Wednesday.  If there is anything on Mark's schedule consistent with those constraints, please let me know.  Thanks. DF 
 I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate entitiy until we get down the road a ways. 
 What a tangled mess.  please call and splain what's going on here.  Thanks. DF 
 pls put on my calendar.  thanks.df 
 The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I'm not sure it is a legal conflict of interest.  The Northern cases he is involved in are not really  "GISB matters."  There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance issue that involve GISB standards, however.  GISB is a freestanding entitity and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself.  As long as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with what GISB wants, he's technically OK.  I suspect he'd argue that his work in the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB's objective of achieving world domination.  This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something.  For example, I'm not really clear on GISB's structure.  Can we argue that it is not a real stand alone entity but rather  a "front" for a cooperative group of companies that includes Enron?  If so, we might have a real conflict.  Thanks. DF

 here'[s the second installment.  Thanks DF 
 This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.  Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK with you?  DF 
 Following is one of the documents I got on Friday.  the other will follow shortly.  I think Maria forwarded this already, but you ought to make sure she got it. Thanks. DF 
 No way!  Joining up with Russell???  That's interesting, I thought he had "hung 'em up" as they say.  I want the full scoop.  DF 
 Outstanding.  I'll  bring em and I'll call you guys in a week or so to get the details nailed down.  Did you know that Bienawski (sp?), the Sofregaz guy, is at Enron?  He's got a storage development group or some damn thing. I'm going to look him up and see what the heck he thinks he's doing.  DF 
 I am troubled by your report.  Perhaps we need to threaten to revoke the anmesty and impose sanctions for noncompliance?  Or deputize someone mean to search file cabinets?  In all seriousness, would all of you please remind your troops of the importance of this effort, as I will with my folks.  Rick, thanks for the hard work  and perseverance on this.  DF 
 I heard that NE Hub made it through the Oriskany without blowing anything up.  Siggy must have been so pleased, and Penn Fuel and CNG so disappointed! Hey, I'm gonna be down the week of May 30-June 3 and would like to get together with you guys.  What's going on that week?  Would there be any reason, say, to bring golf clubs?  I hear that my much ballyhooed former law partner David Hill might be down in Houston the same time and I need to have a few beers on his expense account as well.  Pat, I don't think you've met this guy but you need to, if for no other reason because he buys beers.   DF 
 I heard a great report the other day from David Hill that you guys made it through the Oriskany without any interesting pyrotechnics!  What a disappointment that must have been for Karol Lynn and CNG!  Sounds like a pretty boring operation up there, otherwise I might be tempted to drop by and see the show.  Also heard that the knuckleheads from Bath got thrown out of court on their antitrust suit.  Shit, all you needed to do all along was get rid of me and things started falling into place!!!  Best wishes for continued success--and Siguaw, stay the hell out of trouble! AMFDJF 
 So Haskell is trying to play good guy with us on Kansas Ad Valorem while he's trashing us at FEEBLE.  ENA is not one of the "largest single shippers" on Northern, at least in the market area.  They did that big negotiated rate deal with us, however for 300,000Dth, so I expect that is what Haskell is talking about.  They may in fact be the single biggest firm customer among the producer/marketer segment.  MKM and I ought to whup up on him down in KC next week on this issue. 
 Great letter.  I'd even suggest that you have the Weird Herald folks out for a tour, but well-intentioned ideas like that always backfire with the media. DF

 Wow.  Pretty interesting info.  I'm trying to think of a "plan B" approach, but without ENA (and their turbines) I'm haviang a hard time coming up with one.  Steve, I'll talk to you in Tucson on this.  Thanks.  DF 
 Mike, I hadn't seen your email when we talked today.  I'm fine with whatever approach you want to take with the documents.  I'll call in for the meeting with Stan tomorrow.  I have the phone number.  Sorry we got cut off on the MOPS issue today.  I'm a little communication impaired up here, but I'll call on Wed. or Thur. on MOPS.  in the mean time, please grab whoever you need from my group to get the thinking underway on the new strategy.

 Mike, here are two draft sets of talking points covering Stan's initial phone call with Ted Davis to discuss whether a settlement meeting would be useful and the subsequent settlement meeting itself.  Please give me any comments you have and I'll send to Stan or have available to hand to him at our meeting, which I understand is scheduled for 9 am on Tuesday.  I'll  be calling in from Arizona.  Note there is at least one issue we ought to think about a bit more--whether to have Stan imply there may be other goodies available other than the Hobbs Line.  I'm inclined to avoid implying that, but to have Stan primed to pull out additional goodies if necessary.  I have not yet completed a bullet point outline of the settlement proposal for Stan to send to Davis after Stan and he meet.  As things currently stand it would basically be identical to the second sheet of talking points.   I would prefer to finalize that document after we meet with Stan, both to minimize the paper in front of him at the Tuesday meeting and to allow the Davis outline to be tailored to reflect the strategy we arrive at with Stan (I think I'm safe in assuming we will tinker with the strategy a bit on Tuesday morning).  If we do modify the strategy, I'll also modify the talking points.  Britt and Barrett, I wanted you to know the timetable in part because, if Stan decides to go forward,  we need to send Barrett's suggested letter to Jad verifying continued application of the settlement privilege to Stan and Ted's discussions.   I intend to call you after the Stan meeting to advise. Just in case you don't hear from me by late morning Tuesday, please give Mike a call to confirm whether to send the letter.  I may have fallen into the Grand Canyon or been bitten by a hila monster. 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 Great--please let me know how it goes.  I'm out next wk but will check voice mails.  Also, why does my email down below say "Enron Energy Services?"  My computer has apparently transferred me to EES.  I need a vacation.  DF 
 Outstanding!!!  Still colder than shit up here--what are you guys even thinking on moving up here????  I'll call you to check out the details later this week.  Thanks. DF 
 I'd be happy to talk to either of you about NNG's experience or work I did in my former life for my old client Market Hub Partners on requests for market based rates for their Egan Louisiana, Moss Bluff, Texas and Tioga Pennsylvania projects. 
 Glad to help--concocting market based rates for storage facilities that probably don't deserve them is one of the few things I know how to do.  DF 
 I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to. 
 Good job on the draft.  My comments are redlined on the attached doc.  Lets get it on file ASAPPDQ.  Thanks.  DF

 I will be particularly interested in an update on the "Topock Decontamination" item on the agenda.  Give me a break.  DF 
 Tino called today to report on their meetings with DOE last week.  Tino, Dennis Langley, and their outside lawyer Jim Slattery met with Bill Richardson and DOE staff to discuss the "sole source" procurement approach to DOE's obtaining an alternative power supplier for Kirtland AFB and Sandia. Tino reports that Richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject only to DOE review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the public interest.  Tino believes that the combination of significant Native American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price that is lower than DOE's current PNM rates will satisfy the "public interest" standard.  Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall structure of Dennis' proposal.  I am surprised that Dennis would go this far before hearing from us on the economics, but Tino made it sound like the initial discussions would be fairly general--i.e., to explain to DOE that the plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole thing in partnership with the Isleta Tribe, but without talking about specific economic issues.  Sounds to me like Dennis has Richardson on board but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level DOE staff people what a great deal this is for the Tribes and therefore the government.  Tino, not surprisingly, is eager to see numbers and sit down to discuss them.  He suggested a meeting the first week of May in either Houston or KC. I asked Tino whether he could get firmer numbers from DOE than we currently have on (1) total electric and gas load (current and projected) for the AFB and Sandia and (2) actual price DOE currently pays for gas and power.  He didn't think he could get better information before the first week in May.  On another related topic, through Shelley Corman's group  I got acquainted with a guy named Tim Beldon who runs the ENA transmission capacity book for the Western U.S., out of Portland.  I talked with him for a few minutes about power flows and pricing in the N.M-Arizona area and he seemed pretty knowledgable.  He has a transmission engineer on his team who is an expert in verifying utility claims of transmission constraints.  Apparently, ENA buys and sells a lot of power in the four corners area and is pretty familiar with the transmission availabilty and power pricing situation up there.  I didn't discuss with Tim the specifics of the project we are looking at, but did tell him that Kevin and Steve were looking at a potential power plant load and trying to figure out how serious it is.  Kevin, if you guys think Beldon could provide useful info on the cost and availability of firm and non-firm transmission for the surplus power out of Albequerque up to four corners, please give him a call.  It is OK to disclose to Beldon what we are working on, but please inform him that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement and that further disclosure is improper.  Please let me know whether a meeting with these guys the first week of May is doable.  Thanks.  DF 
 Corporate schizophrenia.  Weird.   DF 
 I understand that you guys have retained Holland and Hart to give us another set of eyes on the Navajo issues.  For future reference, I have finally hooked up with the South Dakota firm I mentioned and was favorably impressed with their experience in similar matters.  Don Schultz and a couple of his partners have substantial litigation experience both for and against the S.D. tribes (Ogalla Sioux, etc.) on federal jurisdictional issues.  One of Don's partners is general counsel of the Rushmore Electric Cooperative in Western South Dakota and has had dealings with the tribes on right of way issues for years.   They have cleared conflicts, and are available  if we ever need a third opinion or if we get into a spat with the tribes elsewhere.  Sorry it took me so long to run this to ground.  Thanks. DF 
 Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political winds.  I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate.  I also agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under NGA section 4/5.  To challenge the deals under some state law "gouging" theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part, etc.  I'll talk to you and Kathy further tomorrow AM and then we can grab Mike to discuss. Thanks.  DF 
 I think I am OK.  DF 
 I think I got my address book fixed and the Harris pro blem is solved forever.  Thanks!  DF 
 I don't think the new policy helps us, but it would help an intrastate pipeline that wanted to interconnect with us.  DF 
 Not yet--I'll try this wkend.  thanks. DF 
 Thanks Vig--this is very helpful as I've gotten a bit out of the loop over the last several weeks.   I don't know exactly what the reason was for striking this from our agenda for tomorrow, but it might be for the better since we can now schedule a prefiling devoted exclusively to this filing. Lets talk next wk on where we stand wi
