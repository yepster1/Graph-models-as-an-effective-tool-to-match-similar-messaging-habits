 Also, I'll be in DC the 22d and 23d of March--where are you?  DF 
 I got the call today.  Got the job.  I feel like the dog that caught the car--enjoyed the chase but don't know quite what to do with the car.  DF 
 Thanks!  I agree-lets stay offline on possible deals.  DF 
 Please take a look at this new communication tool at your earliest convenience and give your input to one or more projects.

 Approved.  DF 
 Julia and Steve--here are some questions I've sent to Darrell on the TW Cal. border line pack sales.  I'd like him to pull in the right people to get me the answers so we will be prepared if we need to explain these events. Darrell--I thought I'd better let your bosses know that I've been putting more stuff on your already full plate.  Thanks all.  DF 
 You are right-- Glen and Tony confirmed.  Thanks .  DF 
 I haven't seen a contract yet on the original 33,000 on TW but Susan thought the deal was going to be done--she's checking to see where the holdup is.  On the El Paso capacity, Mavrix never submitted a bid.  I think the deadline got past us before we were ready.  df 
 In anticipation of potential litigation involving TW's operational activities, please prepare an analysis for me of the reasons for TW's sale of excess natural gas at the California border.  I am aware of several of these sales and have been  informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic reason for them.  I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the following information: 1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border? 2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination? 3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary? 4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to previous years? 5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision to make a sale is reached?  Thanks for your attention to this request.  Please give me a call to discuss and please designate your response as "Privileged and Confidential, Attorney Client Privileged." 
 FYI.  DF 
 Great idea--I don't have any specific suggestions to add to this checklist, but I encourage all of you to help Susan get this finalized.  I know you guys have all worked hard on these deals and I appreciate that hard work and your patience.  We all deserve a system that works more smoothly, so lets take Susan's lead and create one!  Thanks.  DF 
 I got Jim Derrick's sign off on V & E on the patent for Kim and Martha--bring the guy in  and get him acquainted with them and keep me posted.  thanks. df 
 Thanks.  My guess is that someone ought to go and represent TW.  Fawcett and Harris ought to make that call.  Jeff D:  I assume you know who Lad Lorenz is.  Either Jeff:  does Lad's involvement signal anything to us--i.e., is he their "get stuff done guy" or their "try to look like you are getting stuff done guy" ?  DF

 Very artful--I think this resolves MKM's concern but I'll defer to her on= =20 that.  This approach does also give us more commercial flexibility which I= =20 think the marketers should like.  df 
 The way I understand the suggestion, we will always be able to change a slate if we need to.  This puts more of the responsibility on us to keep the names updated if any changes need to be made.  I guess I have no problem with that as long as we can develop a systematic way of handling this and then be disciplined about following that system.  Bill--I suspect you will end up being our "system" so are you up to it? 
 Outstanding!!  Its great to see a South Dakota guy get the recognition he s= o=20 richly deserves!  Congratulations Steve!  DF 
 Pls forward it to Kathy Ringblom in my group in Omaha.  We'll handle.  That guy's a bargain.  Thanks. df 
 Anything from Knippa???  DF 
 Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it.  The Thursday rehearing order dramatically changes how the "shipper must have title" rule applies to acquisitions of upstream capacity.   I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules.  FERC specifically held that the "shipper must have title" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe treats the acquired capacity "as though it were part of its own system".  (p. 61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be done without advance Commission approval.   Now, FERC explains that it did not intend a "blanket waiver" of the shipper must have title policy.   Pipes can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism.  If the acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the "must have title" policy is required (see FN 20 and text).   We are right back to where we started.  I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely to grant waivers of the "must have title" policy than in the past, but I don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.  Shelley--let me know if you hear any expressions of outrage from other pipes.  This might be worth chasing on rehearing since it is such a clear about face by FERC.

 Jim--its been a long time since I bothered you!  Congrats (tentatively) on the settlement with the Navajos--sounds to me like you and Mr Soldano did some fine work!  We still haven't pulled the trigger on arbitration of the OneOk imbalance (the measurement issue) but we are getting closer.  Before we do, I wanted to get your thoughts on our "two prong" strategy once again.  You will recall that we intend to initiate the arbitration and simultaneously file a dec action in Texas state court.  That approach is described briefly in the attached pleading.  The pleading is pretty brief and terse--both Grant Harvey at Gibbs and Bruns and Britt wanted to keep the dec action as straightforward as possible.  I'll ask my secretary to block off an hour sometime this afternoon or early next week if your schedule permits.  I look forward to talking with you!  Thanks.  DF 
 What the hell is going on with you???  I'm bored and lonely--and will be in DC on the 20 and 21st.  Any chance of drinking and cigar smoking??  We got a nice note from your mom and it sounds like  Rollie is doing great.  That was super to hear.  Take care dude.  DF

 I'm on a conf. call with Minnegasco from 8-10 Friday.  Please go forward without me and I'll circle back in later.  My view is that we need to look hard at a second expansion project, maybe jointly with Questar or someone else (Mojave?) that goes all the way to the market.  We may be semi-serious about the within-Cal. portion of the project, but it would be great potential leverage against the utilities and CPUC.  df 
 I'm on a call until about 10.  I'll come down and try to grab you and susan and lets call MKM and get a plan.  df 
 Colleen has some useful expertise because of her work on the Clifton Machine Shop project (i.e., setting up a new business entity within the ETS organization).  Tony and Lee have some time if Colleen's plate is full. Either one of them, relying on Colleen for "best practices" input as needed, might be a good team.  DF 
 Generally good.  Madden is generally pro market and has a pretty good relationship with Stan and Shelley.  DF 
 There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a combination of both.  Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options (to steal Jeff's term), like the following: 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or whatever number we decide on) 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages)  A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options?  A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at $.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and $.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.  Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???  A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else? Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh.  Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out and sell this stuff.  DF 
 Thanks for the heads up.  Good idea on Kim and Martha--pls line them up for the next meeting after tomorrow (call Martha Benner to schedule)  DF 
 Great--thanks.  df 
 Great!!  DF 
 Attached below is my approval of a bunch of capacity packages for sale on EOL.  As you can see, I think there is an important issue of contract language that we need to resolve at some point if we are going to get maximum mileage out of EOL.  Please let me know what you think we ought to do about this--in my view, if we are going to sell long term capacity on a discounted basis, we ought to keep using the language we have historically used on what happens if our max rates are reduced and what happens if our rate design is modified.  As to the old confidentiality paragraph and some of the other stuff, I'm not sure it is worth keeping and running the risk of FERC finding that we have overreached (i.e., the paragraph saying a customer can't ever challenge our discount adjustment).   Lets talk.  df 
 I am OK on selling these packages on EOL.  This approval is based on my understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to sale.  Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again).  I also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year. Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our "standard discount language" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal.  I think we can live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term deals on EOL.  ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate.  I think our approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a basis run up could make it a very valuable right).  If you have any questions, call me.  DF 
 Thanks for your work on this also, Dan!!  DF 
 I need you guys to look at this quick and give me advice.  df 
 No, but MKM apparently thought this issue did impact the idea of uniformity of approach among the pipelines, which is Shelley's turf.  df 
 lets talk in am--did we pay SET to forgo their option on the Gallup space????? ON the "gross margin" spreads mentioned in 3, do we hedge the fuel componenet or is that the customer's problem?  Pls print this page for me as I can't.   DF 
 pls print for me on Monday--thanks.  df 
 Can we get together for a half hour or so on Monday to discuss?  That would be helpful, so I can hear the thinking you guys went through.  Denise, pls print for me.  Thanks.  df

 Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting: 1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly. 2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told. 3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.  Thanks.  DF 
 see--I am dumb!  thanks dan.  df 
 dan--pls hookl this up for me, I'm too dumb.  df 
 More specifically, this is the ECS Gallup mtg--Kevin, will we have answers on our peak avoidance by then?  Thanks. DF 
 Just summarize the proposal again (briefly) and indicate the changes we agreed to make based on the technical conference and how we believe the initial filing, as modified to resolve the reasonable concerns raised by parties, ought to be approved.  I'd also add a short recount on the conoco and I. Shippers issues and indicate that vague, industry wide market affiliate issues are not appropriate in this docket and that the fact that some (not even all) producers have paranoid competitive concerns should not preclude shippers who would really benefit form these products from gaining access to them (i.e, summarize CalPine's very helpful comments).  df 
 Jeff and I just talked and Jeff is going to go back to USGT and Astra and negotiate a fix to the release issue--new drafts will be circulated.  DF

 I've just been invited to a couple of meetings on Friday PM--the kind of meetings where the word "invited" is used humorously.  I think I'm still clear after 4:00 pm Omaha time so could be dialed in after then if it would be useful.  Sorry to be such a pain inthe ass but getting fired would be a real inconvenience right now so I'd better post at these meetings.  I'll have Martha coordinate with you guys. 
 Would we be better off letting the trade associations fight this one out?  I haven't read the pleading yet, but from your description, I wouldn't be surprised if all of them oppose it--AGA included.  DF

 I haven't had a chance to study this yet, but I'd like you guys to take a hard look at it and lets meet on Mon or Tues.  I'll  be in Houston ( I think).  Martha pls set up a meeting with these guys and I'll talk to you about when I'm going down.  df 
 Thanks Mark--we'll take a look at this information and be ready to discuss with you guys.  I'll take the lead on getting a new meeting set up.  DF 
 now that I look at this, I'm not sure I'm included as I was just a bcc on the email.  Please check out the website and see if you can learn anything.  pls print out the relevant parts of the website includeing a list of which computers we can choose from.  thanks df 
 Good thinking and good hustle on your part Craig, as usual.  Do we know what the system problems were and if they were on their end or ours?  I agree that timetable issues in general and the approval process for Demarc deals, in particular, need to be reviewed when we get together on contract process issues. 
 If the condition in OneOk's release tied to KN's settlement is "simply unacceptable" to ONeOk, then there is no deal unless we simultaneously receive the $$ from KN and OneOk and simultaneously sign the agreements.  We will need to set up a closing type of event (not necessarily in one city, over the phone and fax is ok) and hold each other hostage until all the paper is signed and wire transfers received.  Just in case she's curious, my position is we don't sign the release until the wire transfer is in our bank.  They can take the risk of the deal falling apart at the last minute--I don't think we should.  DF 
 Thanks Susan, that makes sense.  df

 I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with: "Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."  Also, the mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor things:  in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add "the" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF 
 ON further reflection, if Mavrix is to be a wholly owned sub of Enron Pipeline Company (or whatever the current name is of the top-tier ETS entity) then that entity ought to issue the guaranty.  Mavrix intends to buy capacity from TW and possibly NN.  It would be innappropriate to have TW issue the guaranty if TWs guaranty would likely operate in favor of TW.  Same for NN. DF    Rod Hayslett 
 Its my understanding that the plan is to have it be a sub of EPC (or whatever the name of the parent of TW and NN  is these days).  I thought it had been moved already, but apparently not.  Susan, whats the status?  df 
 Who is the exact corporate parent of Mavrix?  I think I saw an email that said ETS, but I don't think ETS is a corporate entity.  Is it Enron Pipeline Company?  Please let Bob and me know.  Thanks.  df 
 You blew me off!  Are you in town?  I tried your phone but it's busy.  df 
 I feel awful about that--particularly since PGT did the same thing!  df 
 The Mineral Leasing Act may be the statute that governs--at least I'm familiar with it as the statute governing the MMS onshore oil and gas royalty program.  There are also statutes that cover hard rock mining rights and surface (i.e., grazing) rights.  I'm not sure which one is the basis for Greg's theories.   What you guys need is a real dirt lawyer.  Don't we have any ex-EOG lawyers around?  There aren't any in ETS that I'm aware of that know this stuff.  As to the RFP process, I have even less of an idea.  I hear you on your instinct to give him the answer, but one of my goals is to hear what MMS thinks its legal basis is for going after storage and forming my own view of whether they are right or just blowing smoke.

 I've deferred the negotiation with Mark Knippa given my need for some information from James and Kevin on our ability to avoid peak usage, etc. Steve Harris and I talked this morning about settlement authority and our going in position, obviously, is that ECS should pick up the whole $300+ K. I expect that Knippa will angle toward a split the difference approach and then try to put his share of the value on some future deal.  To counter that,  I think I'll need to hit him pretty firmly on the "relationship issue."  I.e., he's got to fix this problem or his chance of doing more deals with the pipeline group will be seriously hurt.  That should be a big deal to him and may get us the resolution we need.  To push that I need three things from you: 1.  Rod, have we already communicated to ECS, or at a higher level like Redmond, that we won't do any more deals with them?  Obviously if we have already told them we're done working with them, my threat won't carry much weight. 2.  Are you all OK with the threat?  I suspect that our threat to quit doing business with them will go immediately up their chain of command and that Redmond or someone will call Stan to complain. 3.  Can we agree conceptually to do future deals if Knippa needs a bucket to put our dollars in?  He may propose something specific and I'd like to be able to agree that we will "work with them" on future deals.  Thanks.  DF

 We all knew about this concept--its Danny's "Newco" idea.  The only thing that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary's office.  I knew about the name a couple weeks ago.  As far as I know, no one has signed off on any particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when "Mavrix" starts transacting business.  We all better understand at that point that this may be a "lose lose" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes. If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there's no way to plow the losses back into some regulated entity.  It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals. DF 
 Gifts do help--preferably large denominations!    Enron North America Corp. 
 I agree.  DF 
 Thanks Lee.  df 
 yes 
 I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF 
 In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items if I've missed any.  1.  When can TW "selectively market" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to talk to one customer is always "selective" since there's only one guy on the phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off the list of "the usual suspects" we call to pitch a special deal like an index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick analysis of this issue.  2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?  3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max rate strd language deals. 4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  Thanks for your input on this.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks. df 
 I can't wait!  Frank--our expectation is that Staff won't go.  Can you call Harris Wood and approach that subject with him.

 I've got a meeting set up with Knippa at 10:00 on Thursday .  Susan, please join me as Nemec will be there and he and you had most of the back and forth on the confidentiality issue.  Either Steve or Kevin need to give me some sense of our  authority .  Any thoughts on that??  Is the number still $200,000?  What would we be willing to settle for?  Is a renegotiation of the existing deal in the works anyway as part of the expansion scenarios?  I'll have martha set up a meeting Thur. am to discuss before we talk to Knippa. DF 
 I think I need to be down there that week anyway--Martha lets try to schedule it so I can go to this.  thanks df 
 Miles--sorry about the hurry up.  Please give me a call on this at 402-398-7449.  Note the issue raised by the email from Rick Dietz. Thanks.  DF

 I agree with MKM--I think we either said or at least implied in the options conf. and filings that ROFR cap. isn't posted as available until the ROFR is waived.  I think that approach is the logical way to handle postings and that we are pretty much locked into that approach.  On the commercial issue Rita mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the appearance of scarcity.  On that logic, we should want to keep ROFR capacity off the EBB until the right is waived.  DF 
 This guy is going to be a great, and very interesting, chairman!  DF 
 What would we have to do to get rid of the Demarc deal approval requirement (requiring President level approval for all Demarc delivery deals)? Can Danny revoke the policy, just like Bill created it?  DF 
 Makes sense.  Thanks df 
 pls get for Cindy.  Thanks  df 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 Didn';t one of you guys review this for all of us last time?  Let me know--my memory isn't helping me today.  Marhta, please print the stuff for me. thanks all  DF 
 here they are.  gracias 
 I have reviewed your various emails and will get back to Paul shortly.  DF 
 Excellent.  I'll start with Knippa but probably need to work through his boss or Barbara Gray to resolve this.  DF 
 Ex 
 As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have our capacity posting squared away.  DF 
 Not a problem.  I'll let you know how it goes.  df 
 pls print for me. 
 Where are you gonna be on Nov. 7?  Victory parties (or defeat parties) I'm sure.  I may be in DC at least for the afternoon--gonna have any time free? DF 
 Have we been subpoenaed?  If not, can we ignore this problem?  DF 
 Thanks Laura--I'll add these thoughts.  DF 
 Good point.  I'll put it in the forma nd be sure to discuss with her.  df 
 I can fly from Houston to Denver on Thur. late afternoon or evening so I'm available to meet with MMS anytime on Friday.  Martha, please coordinate with Paul and Mark and get me where I need to be, returning to Omaha on Friday after the meeting Mark is setting up.  Pls get me to Hou. on the Thur. am flight and coordinate my flight to Denver so I can fly up with Paul if he is coming direct from Houston.  Mark ought to suggest a hotel and a meeting time with me and Paul either Thur. night or Fri. am.  Thanks all. 
 Once Susan gets the last few pieces of info, either Steve or I should call ECS and try to resolve this.  Steve--you or me??  Its your call.  DF 
 Great.  Let me know when it goes out and get a copy to the group (particulary Shelley who might have to cover press inquiries if PG&E squawks.)  DF 
 I'm stuck on a phone call until about 5.  I think you ought to take it up to Paul and Rod and if they want it out today, get Rod to sign it.  I havn't heard back from Steve Harris so let Rod decide what to do.  Thanks.  DF 
 pls check for me .  thanks. df 
 One additional point.  If we aren't going to try to rebut the "funny money" argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).  Can we argue this???  DF 
 Sorry, my form file is bare on that topic.  DF 
 pl s print.  thanks df 
 No concerns--I think we ought to go.  Thanks.  DF 
 I don't have a problem supporting the concept generally.  Since they took the trouble to ask for our help, its probably the right thing to do politically and relationship-wise.  On the substance, I doubt this will do them or us much good in the long run as FERC will just ignore us all if pipelines start acting as cheerleaders for each others' proposals.  Will they ghost write it or do you need someone to draft it up?  DF 
 Wed. home game vs. Florida.  7:00.  Catching the game and flying back in the AM is a possibility.    DF 
 Hahaha. df 
 I agree-- I also thought we were already doing it that way.  MKM and Glen: Is this a problem on NN also??? 
 Thanks Susan.  MKM:  FYI.  DF 
 I don't think having an intrastate in the ETS family would be a problem.  We could even run it with a merchant business if we firewalled the merchant entity off from the ETS pipelines.  Keep me in the loop and get MKM's group in at the appropriate time (far enough in advance of us submitting a bid that they can opine on the valuation).  Thanks. df 
 Thanks for the helpful message.  I'll go ahead and order her one--I think I'll let her decide where she wants it, as two chairs sounds a bit over the top.  DF 
 I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on the $200k we think they owe us.  Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.  If I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS' fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .  That argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?  At minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.  But we heard nothing.  Is that our story?  If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done. 
 Thanks Bob.  I feel a lot better, particulary since the year end documents won't have to have all the detail.  DF 
 Great.  DF 
 Yea--it was outstanding news!  What a hoss.  Can't catch you this time but keep me posted on your next trip.  DF 
 I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM's spies intercepted.  She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him.  Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to  Stan or urge him to send a written response.  As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers.  Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation. 
 sorry, i left lou off of the message. 
 Lou, do we have any sort of policy on requests like this?  Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair (she only wanted one, however).  Norma, any thoughts? 
 Forgot to cc you.  df 
 OK.  DF 
 whasssup? 
 pls print.  df 
 Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.  They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.  None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not.  Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.  I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down?  DF 
 pls print--I can't get it to print in here.  thanks. df

 yes--lets talk at 9:30 to prep for the 10:00.  df 
 pls forward to all TW and NN legal attorneys and staff--Hou and OMa.  DF=20 
 Per my conversation with Lynn and Steve on Friday night, we have claimed force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st.  (I'm not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be).   Does that have any financial consequences or other consequences for us?  For example, on TW, certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, right?  NN's tariff doesn't have a similar mechanism, but we may have common law exposure.  We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk tomorrow or Wed.  This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for the 1st -4th were not FM.  Any thoughts?  DF 
 That's more or less what I expected.  Good enough to cover us until the 4th. I'll talk to you all tomorrow.  DF 
 I'm good on this.  DF 
 Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off shippers' supply due to force majeure?  1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff (Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer is the same.  2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't work as good.  3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.  I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF 
 I note in TW's bullets for 12-22 that TW did the "Cal Border Backhaul" deal with SW Gas.  The last I heard about it, the deal had cratered.  I had serious reservations about doing the deal as it was initially described to me, which included a Cal border sale of "surplus" gas and a backhaul for EES on behalf of SW Gas.  My probems were (1) the issue of possible or apparent affiliate preference and (2) the need for adequate documentation of "surplus line pack."   My last guidance was that a deal like this might be doable, but only if we could document the "surplus" and if Stan signed off on it.  What happened?  Does the deal involve EES???  Was that raised with Stan and Danny?  The bullets don't mention the identity of the "shipper" that the backhaul was done for.  Please respond.  DF 
 How bout getting me on a Wed PM flight to Hou. on Jan 10 and back to Omaha on the Fri afternoon flight on the 12th?  I need to be in Houston at the office until at least 3:00--can I still get a flight better than the late one?  DF 
 Mike, I'll be down in Houston Thursday and Friday the 11th and 12th.. Would either day be a good one to meet with Robbie Walls?  I've got lunch open both days.  DF 
 I already did.  Thanks. DF 
 OK with me.  Thanks.  DF 
 Lets talk about this on the 4th or 5th.  I'll have Martha set up a meeting.= =20 Note that this will catch the Sempra negotiated rate deals, but not our=20 January deals (yet).  DF 
 Do we need to give notice to customers before we shut in receipt points due to off-spec gas?  Sec. 44 of the NN tariff implies to me that if a customer's gas has too much water, for example, we can shut it in at any time without notice.  Please confirm ASAP.  DF 
 Colder than shit on Fri-Sun.  Nice tomorrow.  I'm getting the urge to play hooky.  DF 
 I'm out the 28th but am glad to discuss today or the 27th if there is anything else I can add on the subject.  Thanks. dF

 I'm glad to have Tino talk to him direct--tee it up that way if you can. Tino's new number is 913-441-1800 (ext. 109).  Thanks Kevin and have a great holiday!! DF 
 I have been typing in his name and letting the computer address it.  I've now added his "@enron.com" address to my address book, so lets see if that does the trick.  Thanks!  DF 
 Julie--pls forward to Danny.  I've had trouble the last couple of days getting emails to go through to him.  Am I doing something wrong? 
 Pls get me in on the meetings with Galasinsi and Mcchane. df 
 Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking etc. We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on, there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF 
 Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the line?  If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal. border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 775 lbs?  Lets talk to McShane tomorrow.  Thanks.. DF  e 
 Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or $10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA guys.  Thanks.  DF 
 Way cool.  DF 
 Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.  I'll give you a call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.   The plan that makes the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.  We'll simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January as Stan suggested.  I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial hurdles.   DF 
 When you guys give me a new computer, can I get a (smaller) laptop with some kind of docking station???  I don't need a desktop if I get a good laptop.. I'd suggest we keep the IBM laptop as the department's roving laptop if it is upgradable to Windows 2000.  Thanks.  DF 
 MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem (i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement). If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call. If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to MidAm:  1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.  2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the Settlement, their only real "cost" would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.  3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues. MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall.   That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF 
 Here is the latest on timetable on Gallup.  Susan, please get your edits on the draft to Donna and me by tomorrow.  (call me if you need more guidance on what I have in mind).   Donna or Keith, please let me know what additioonal information you are waiting on and what the likely timetable for filing is. Also, Keith, what was the answer from ops/planning on whether unloading the 20,000 of fuel from the San Juan would help with more flexibility or capacity?  If you haven't been able to get a meaningful answer, let me know who to call and I'll try. 
 I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral. If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything possible to expedite these efforts.  DF 
 On Thursday last week the Commission eliminated the old "Texas Eastern" rule that required pipelines to obtain prior FERC approval before contracting for transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.  The new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to FERC first.  The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.  Interestingly, the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant to its capacity release program.  The order is silent on whether the price cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.   While we are still reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, I'd emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.   For example, the "Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures" dated Feb. 3, 2000 provides Dave and Steve with authority up to $250,000 on operating expense obligations.  Please contact me if you have any questions on this matter.  DF

 I don't see anything controversial in Leslie's outline.  We've done  a lot of thinking about Dynegy's "funny money" argument and I volunteer Maria to work with you and Leslie on making sure ENA's comments are consistent with ours on this and all related issues.  DF 
 I think that is exactly right.  I suspect that the marketing guys could work up a simple formula for determining our course of action depending on the size of the revenue opportunity vs. the power cost/penalty.  Thanks. df 
 Excellent idea!!  There is ample opportunity for all three of us in the hot air business.  I talked to Dave yesterday and I think this is a great fit for him.  He's back to doing what he does best--convincing investors and customers to pour money into a hole in the ground! 
 Great--the front running ideas now are (1) an operational sale in the San Juan of the 20,000 we recieve there and an offsetting operational purchase (less basis differential) at some other location (i.e., the permian) thus freeing up 20,000/d of physical space on the lateral; or (2) an exchange agreement under which a party takes our 20,000 in the SJ and gives us back the same amount, less basis differential, in the permian.  The SJ 20,000 would still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under someone's transport agreement--in other words it wouldn't be incremental to our 850,000/d of firm transport obligations.  I don't know if this will work yet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna.  I'm eager to talk to Steve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario that Susan researched  a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe there are problems or solutions yet to be considered.  DF 
 Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there? We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF 
 pls give that copy of Gorak's sba filing to maria.  I think I left it with you and Mary.  df 
 Thanks for following up on this all.  I'm good on Stuart's recommendation.  DF 
 Shelley--looks good to me.  DF 
 I think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to have Keith and Ray briefed and ready to answer all FERC's questions without deferring any to other people.  Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing that , you should be able to get them the information they need without having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers. Lee, I'd like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at.  Please let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach.  DF 
 Pls get me scheduled on the 13th.  thanks df

 Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off shippers' supply due to force majeure?  1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff (Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer is the same.  2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't work as good.  3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.  I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF 
 That's more or less what I expected.  Good enough to cover us until the 4th. I'll talk to you all tomorrow.  DF 
 Per my conversation with Lynn and Steve on Friday night, we have claimed force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st.  (I'm not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be).   Does that have any financial consequences or other consequences for us?  For example, on TW, certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, right?  NN's tariff doesn't have a similar mechanism, but we may have common law exposure.  We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk tomorrow or Wed.  This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for the 1st -4th were not FM.  Any thoughts?  DF 
 pls forward to all TW and NN legal attorneys and staff--Hou and OMa.  DF=20 
 yes--lets talk at 9:30 to prep for the 10:00.  df 
 Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad. In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.  Apparently, a bunch of utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  If the RR owns its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.  In other words, the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.  If we did that, Dave thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.  Since our lines cross or parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that would be foolish.  I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW without too much pain.  If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.  Assuming we can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we decide to go forward.  Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific "to dos" or any specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino.  So what do you guys think should happen next?  DF

 I'd love to see his last article, but don't see any advantage in giving him any real information on our struggles right now.  Maybe after the dust settles in a few weeks I'll be less nervous.  DF 
 pls get me into this.  df 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 Agreed.  DF 
 Sounds spiffy.  df 
 pls print--I can't get it to print in here.  thanks. df 
 Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.  They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.  None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not.  Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.  I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down?  DF 
 pls print.  df 
 whasssup? 
 Here it is.  Thanks. DF 
 OK.  DF 
 Forgot to cc you.  df 
 Lou, do we have any sort of policy on requests like this?  Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair (she only wanted one, however).  Norma, any thoughts? 
 sorry, i left lou off of the message. 
 I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM's spies intercepted.  She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him.  Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to  Stan or urge him to send a written response.  As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers.  Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation. 
 Yea--it was outstanding news!  What a hoss.  Can't catch you this time but keep me posted on your next trip.  DF 
 I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on the $200k we think they owe us.  Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.  If I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS' fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .  That argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?  At minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.  But we heard nothing.  Is that our story?  If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done. 
 Thanks for the helpful message.  I'll go ahead and order her one--I think I'll let her decide where she wants it, as two chairs sounds a bit over the top.  DF 
 I don't think having an intrastate in the ETS family would be a problem.  We could even run it with a merchant business if we firewalled the merchant entity off from the ETS pipelines.  Keep me in the loop and get MKM's group in at the appropriate time (far enough in advance of us submitting a bid that they can opine on the valuation).  Thanks. df 
 Thanks Susan.  MKM:  FYI.  DF 
 Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF 
 I agree-- I also thought we were already doing it that way.  MKM and Glen: Is this a problem on NN also??? 
 Hahaha. df 
 Wed. home game vs. Florida.  7:00.  Catching the game and flying back in the AM is a possibility.    DF 
 I don't have a problem supporting the concept generally.  Since they took the trouble to ask for our help, its probably the right thing to do politically and relationship-wise.  On the substance, I doubt this will do them or us much good in the long run as FERC will just ignore us all if pipelines start acting as cheerleaders for each others' proposals.  Will they ghost write it or do you need someone to draft it up?  DF 
 No concerns--I think we ought to go.  Thanks.  DF 
 pl s print.  thanks df 
 One additional point.  If we aren't going to try to rebut the "funny money" argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).  Can we argue this???  DF 
 pls check for me .  thanks. df 
 I'm stuck on a phone call until about 5.  I think you ought to take it up to Paul and Rod and if they want it out today, get Rod to sign it.  I havn't heard back from Steve Harris so let Rod decide what to do.  Thanks.  DF 
 Great.  Let me know when it goes out and get a copy to the group (particulary Shelley who might have to cover press inquiries if PG&E squawks.)  DF 
 Thanks for the report--glad it went over well.  DF 
 Once Susan gets the last few pieces of info, either Steve or I should call ECS and try to resolve this.  Steve--you or me??  Its your call.  DF 
 I can fly from Houston to Denver on Thur. late afternoon or evening so I'm available to meet with MMS anytime on Friday.  Martha, please coordinate with Paul and Mark and get me where I need to be, returning to Omaha on Friday after the meeting Mark is setting up.  Pls get me to Hou. on the Thur. am flight and coordinate my flight to Denver so I can fly up with Paul if he is coming direct from Houston.  Mark ought to suggest a hotel and a meeting time with me and Paul either Thur. night or Fri. am.  Thanks all. 
 Good point.  I'll put it in the forma nd be sure to discuss with her.  df 
 Thanks Laura--I'll add these thoughts.  DF 
 Have we been subpoenaed?  If not, can we ignore this problem?  DF

 Not a problem.  I'll let you know how it goes.  df 
 As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have our capacity posting squared away.  DF 
 Ex 
 Bummer.  Thanks for the quick answer.  The Maritimes case does give us at least a small foothold to use.  DF 
 Excellent.  I'll start with Knippa but probably need to work through his boss or Barbara Gray to resolve this.  DF 
 I have reviewed your various emails and will get back to Paul shortly.  DF 
 here they are.  gracias 
 Didn';t one of you guys review this for all of us last time?  Let me know--my memory isn't helping me today.  Marhta, please print the stuff for me. thanks all  DF 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 pls get for Cindy.  Thanks  df 
 What would we have to do to get rid of the Demarc deal approval requirement (requiring President level approval for all Demarc delivery deals)? Can Danny revoke the policy, just like Bill created it?  DF 
 This guy is going to be a great, and very interesting, chairman!  DF 
 I agree with MKM--I think we either said or at least implied in the options conf. and filings that ROFR cap. isn't posted as available until the ROFR is waived.  I think that approach is the logical way to handle postings and that we are pretty much locked into that approach.  On the commercial issue Rita mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the appearance of scarcity.  On that logic, we should want to keep ROFR capacity off the EBB until the right is waived.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 That was an interesting little conversation.  I came back down and looked for you guys but you had both split.  We should take a few minutes and plug John in on what happened at the end of that meeting when the power issues came up.  I'm somewhat surprised at Bill's reaction, but what the hell, now we can run with Cunningham, and we know MKM's pulse on Hubbard (and Bill's).  Pretty damn good end to the week, all things considered.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks. df

 I've got a meeting set up with Knippa at 10:00 on Thursday .  Susan, please join me as Nemec will be there and he and you had most of the back and forth on the confidentiality issue.  Either Steve or Kevin need to give me some sense of our  authority .  Any thoughts on that??  Is the number still $200,000?  What would we be willing to settle for?  Is a renegotiation of the existing deal in the works anyway as part of the expansion scenarios?  I'll have martha set up a meeting Thur. am to discuss before we talk to Knippa. DF 
 fyi.  df 
 I can't wait!  Frank--our expectation is that Staff won't go.  Can you call Harris Wood and approach that subject with him.  It was my understanding that Staff didn't expect to come, but just in case MGO or Midam have gotten to him and talked him into Staff attending, lets talk him out of it.  Thanks.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks. df 
 In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items if I've missed any.  1.  When can TW "selectively market" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to talk to one customer is always "selective" since there's only one guy on the phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off the list of "the usual suspects" we call to pitch a special deal like an index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick analysis of this issue.  2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?  3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max rate strd language deals. 4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  Thanks for your input on this.  DF 
 I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF 
 Pls RSVP "no" if necessary.  Thanks. 
 yes 
 Thanks Lee.  df 
 I agree.  DF 
 Gifts do help--preferably large denominations!    Enron North America Corp. 
 We all knew about this concept--its Danny's "Newco" idea.  The only thing that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary's office.  I knew about the name a couple weeks ago.  As far as I know, no one has signed off on any particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when "Mavrix" starts transacting business.  We all better understand at that point that this may be a "lose lose" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes. If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there's no way to plow the losses back into some regulated entity.  It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals.

 I've deferred the negotiation with Mark Knippa given my need for some information from James and Kevin on our ability to avoid peak usage, etc. Steve Harris and I talked this morning about settlement authority and our going in position, obviously, is that ECS should pick up the whole $300+ K. I expect that Knippa will angle toward a split the difference approach and then try to put his share of the value on some future deal.  To counter that,  I think I'll need to hit him pretty firmly on the "relationship issue."  I.e., he's got to fix this problem or his chance of doing more deals with the pipeline group will be seriously hurt.  That should be a big deal to him and may get us the resolution we need.  To push that I need three things from you: 1.  Rod, have we already communicated to ECS, or at a higher level like Redmond, that we won't do any more deals with them?  Obviously if we have already told them we're done working with them, my threat won't carry much weight. 2.  Are you all OK with the threat?  I suspect that our threat to quit doing business with them will go immediately up their chain of command and that Redmond or someone will call Stan to complain. 3.  Can we agree conceptually to do future deals if Knippa needs a bucket to put our dollars in?  He may propose something specific and I'd like to be able to agree that we will "work with them" on future deals.  Thanks.  DF
