 the WSJ already, but for those of us in Omaha (who don't typically get the Texas Edition) it was news to us.  Not only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by $10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our business.  I'm not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for financial or commodity deals.  DF 
 Congratulations on your new responsibilities.  I look forward to working with you on the Litigation Unit stuff (as Eric will advise you, a very pleasant task!).  DF 
 Congrats big guy!  I look forward to showing you the sights in the Big O. Since that will only take about 10 minutes, we'll have plenty time to go out for a beer afterwords!  DF 
 Good idea--its good to get Martha out of town now and then so the rest of us can get some rest!  DF 
 You guys are making us and our shareholders rich.  I hope you are having fu= n=20 doing it.  Keep up the good work!  DF 
 I've redlined the outline to address what I believe is the most important risk you guys will face out there:  the risk that FERC will listen to your presentation and conclude that the embedded optionality that some pipelines are currently offering in transport contracts is a negotiated term and condition and therefore must be stopped.  I think we need to tailor the presentation and filing to minimize the chance that FERC will take away flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts in transport contracts).   Even if the TW approach on unbundled options goes nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend on continued ability to sell embedded options.   Susan, Shelley,a nd MKM, I still think it is a good idea to push this proposal, but am concerned that FERC might squirrel and go the opposite direction we are trying to push them.  Your thoughts?  DF 
 the bid/asked spread narrows as you go out in time also--weird.  I'll come down and grab you guys in a minute as I have a few questions.  Thanks.  DF 
 The Market Services bullets listed a capacity release deal between MUD and Oxy at 102% of max. rates.  Please let me know whatever we know about that deal--points, term, etc.  Very interesting.  DF 
 Thanks for the prompt info!!  I hope we can help this guy get his power plant built.  DF 
 Sorry, just got back from Houston and my duties require me to be in the big O for a few days.  Enerson and I were just talking about you on Friday--I'm forwarding this to him so he can take you out and feed you.  Hope all goes well.  Give me a ring if you have a few minutes and I'll give you the update on what's going on up here (dial 87-7449 in case you've forgotten how to dial us from world headquarters).  DF 
 John, great to hear that you are still doing the Lord's work on this case! Sounds like you have things well in hand and that the appeal argument went well.  Good luck on this one and please let me know how it turns out--in fact, please send me a copy of the appellate decision when issued at this email address or by mail at 1111 S. 103d St. Omaha Nebraska, 68124.  Thanks. DF 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 please find out when/where this meeting is and get me in on it--also, is this attachment the same document that Tony sent me and I sent to you to print? thanks df 
 this answers when and where 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 the former--an extension of the 15 day deadline on disclosing the prices 
 Eric, I think it would be good for you to join us for this meeting.  We're following up on some concerns that arose during the Conoco case about inadequate compliance with Enron document retention policies.  I'm not sure that this subject is within your turf down there, but your historical experience may be useful. 
 Great to hear from you!  I'll forward this to the smart guys and see if they have any interest.  Let me know which pipes you'll interconnect with and we'll have a better sense of who else in the organization might be interested.  Kent and Morgan, when we get Tony's response on the interconnects, can you think it through from Florida's perspective also? Thanks.  DF 
 Im big on togetherness, but if you'd rather do separate meetings I'm ok with that also.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 Did you all see the blurb in Sep. 29 gas daily on Williams' deal with PROS on a revenue management system?  May be useful to use with our management if there is anxiety about going forward.  DF 
 for calendar.  thanks df 
 Optional.  (to this meeting, I mean!) df 
 OK.  df 
 OK.  df 
 Stan is now the president of Northern.  Dari, have you seen any changes to the org. charts etc. to reflect this?  DF 
 Are you shittin' me?  Do we do this every quarter?  DF 
 FYI:  more O&M gymnastics, but so far no impact on law.  DF 
 What's up?  Did Rick fire you?  Or does he work for you now?  DF 
 Many apologies comrade!  By the way, "organization" is spelled with a "z" not an "s" in American English.  Or do you write in English American now?  DF 
 OK.  DF 
 I agree with your concern but I've gotten comfortable that the pleading does a good job of finessing the issue.  Technically, you are right and PNM's service is neither "firm" or "interruptible."  It is my understanding that PNM  assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the customer is a core customer or not, et cet.  I think that PNM is capable of determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be firm, even though the rate schedule may not say "firm."   Explaining all that complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing. Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is "firm."  I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful detail on how PNM handles its own priority system.  If I misunderstand the facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it.  DF 
 This looks good to me.  Legal is still OK with this approach.  DF 
 Looks good to me  wiht Tony's revision.  DF 
 Lee, I did get your draft.  Sorry I didn't get to it right away.  My comments are attached.  Please review and make sure I didn't exaggerate the obligation too much.  I agree that Stuart should take a look.  Thanks. DF 
 OK by me.  dF 
 pls print and hand to me.  DF 
 I hope you make it in and get this Mon. AM!  We missed you!  Please print and hand off to me so I can head it during Bill's mtg.  Adios.  DF 
 Pls give me a call. DF 
 I don't see any immediate problem.  As long as the advertising didn't interfere with the effectiveness and efficiency of Hot Tap as a tool for satisfying our posting and notice obligations, FERC shouldn't care.  The revenue would be nonjurisdictional and would be treated as such in Northern's or TW's next rate case.  As to the "type of advertising," I can't think of a legal or regulatory reason we need to be picky, but we may want to exclude certain types of services that seem to rely heavily on internet advertising if you know what I mean.  DF 
 Pls get me scheduled on the 13th.  thanks df 
 I think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to have Keith and Ray briefed and ready to answer all FERC's questions without deferring any to other people.  Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing that , you should be able to get them the information they need without having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers. Lee, I'd like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at.  Please let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach.  DF 
 Shelley--looks good to me.  DF 
 Thanks for following up on this all.  I'm good on Stuart's recommendation.  DF 
 Excellent idea!!  There is ample opportunity for all three of us in the hot air business.  I talked to Dave yesterday and I think this is a great fit for him.  He's back to doing what he does best--convincing investors and customers to pour money into a hole in the ground! 
 MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem (i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement). If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call. If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to MidAm:  1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.  2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the Settlement, their only real "cost" would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.  3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues. MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall.   That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF 
 As soon as I know, you'll know.  DF 
 I'm good on this.  DF 
 I'm OK based on Susan's approval and with her one suggested change.  Thanks. DF 
 I tried calling you to confirm we are all square on the webtext for Northern but can't track down your ph. number.  Please call me if there are any problems or concerns.  Thanks for the help.  DF  402-389-7449 
 Great.  DF 
 Sorry, my form file is bare on that topic.  DF 
 Where are you gonna be on Nov. 7?  Victory parties (or defeat parties) I'm sure.  I may be in DC at least for the afternoon--gonna have any time free? DF 
 Makes sense.  Thanks df 
 As always, when we have a juicy topic, anyone on your  staffs that you think would benefit from this are invited to attend.  DF 
 Not critical--if you have nothing better to do, great.  DF 
 Doug_Gessell@Transcanada.com 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 Looks good to me--load away.  DF 
 Inspiring letter.  My few changes attached. 
 Thanks for the heads up.  Good idea on Kim and Martha--pls line them up for the next meeting after tomorrow (call Martha Benner to schedule)  DF 
 pls print what ever of this junk that I need.  df 
 Sorry, I missed it!  I haven't been briefed yet on what the plan is.  I assume we have one, however.  If anyone tells me what it is, I may be in a position to explain it to you.  DF 
 You are right-- Glen and Tony confirmed.  Thanks .  DF 
 Please take a look at this new communication tool at your earliest convenience and give your input to one or more projects.  This is our opportunity to provide meaningful creative input to the slew of new revenue generation ideas that are flying around.  I appreciate your efforts to make innovation as high a priority in the law group as it is throughout all of Enron!  DF 
 To synthesize what I'm hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni),  our story is that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e., European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points.  For example, we'd post  a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01--March 02 Permian to Topock firm capacity with an exercise date of Jan 1, 2001.  the customer would bid an option price and a transport rate.  We'd look at both components under a publicly posted evaluation method to decide who wins.  I.e., we may post a method saying the winner is the one who pays the highest option fee so long as the transport rate bid is above "x".   Seems pretty straightforward, and we ought to be able to clarify this adequately in our answer to protests.  DF 
 Steve Anderton called today and has cleared the arbitration with his firm's conflict committee.  He's sending an email tomorrow describing the specific results of his conflict check.  I'll forward it to you both for review.  From my discussions with Steve, I think he'd do a great job as our arbitrator. Are we all in agreement on using Steve or are there some other competing candidates?  Do you guys want to talk to him or meet with him first?  Britt, do we need a retention agreement with Steve if we decide to use him?   A self-serving retention agreement may be a good idea if we think OneOk might challenge our arbitrator based on alleged bias.  Also, if we are good to go with Steve, I'd like to send him a package of the key documents and then meet with him to discuss the case sometime in the next week or two.  Britt, any concerns with my doing that as long as I don't send him anything privileged? (I'm assuming for the sake of safety that the attorney client privilege doesn't apply to our communications with our arbitrator unless instructed otherwise).  He is down in Houston two days a week so we could do it there. DF 
 pls circulate to the group.  Thanks df 
 Grab me to discuss for a few minutes--both would be interesting topics.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 I'd be happy to give you some specific feedback on this project.  I think you did a good job of bringing some focus to a project that badly needed focus. I was particularly pleased with how you vectored off from what started out as a computer system enhancement project and instead you brought home a solution that allows us to improve things immediately with manual processes and then upgrade to a system if we choose.  You showed a lot of creativity and flexibility in adapting to the changing project focus.  I really valued your thoroughness in getting input from all interested parties.  Your legwork up front made it a lot easier to get needed buy-in when we finally brought management in.  The product was timely and I expect it to deliver on my expectations, although the implementation will be the key.  Thanks again for the good work, and expect me to be a frequent customer.  DF 
 Paul Bieniawski's phone number is 713-345-8641.  Go ahead and give him a call just as a courtesy  to let him what you guys are looking at at Bushton and let him know I put you up to it.  If he has some useful off the cuff insights, great.  If not, that's fine also.  I don't expect you to send him any material or get him deeply involved--just give him a heads up.  DF 
 Ugh.  Do we need to say "from storage inventory" or can we just mention gas sales?  I seem to recall that we already discussed that and the accountants wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the reference less specific.  Thanks. DF 
 FYI.. This will be one of the topics this pm.  DF 
 Great--please make one change for me--change  "influence it" to "comment on it"  at the end of the first par. of B.  thanks DF 
 A couple of issues strike me as particularly important to report on tomorrow: (1) the TW train wreck--possible insurance coverage and strength of any claim against the railroad.  We ought to talk to Lou to make sure we have the latest info as I haven't talked to him since Thursday.  (2)  Status of possible litigation involving OneOk.  I don't think anyone has reported to Stan on the threatening noise from ONeOk about Praxair's rejection of the OneOk force majeure letter.  I'm sure MKM (or Dan on her behalf) will report that we are getting the strangers contract ready to send out, but she may not mention the Winston conversation with Charlie Graham.  I'll check the bullets again to see if anything else jumps out.  Talk to you at 8:30.  DF 
 I'm good with Maria's changes.  Thanks both.  DF 
 Looks good to me--I think you ought to have them file it asap.  Then we need to get a couple of additional shippers to respond to Edwards' thing.  DF 
 The easiest way would be to delay the closing until January.  Is there a reason we can't do that?  DF 
 What's the basis--do you currently use a laptop? 
 pls print.  thanks. dF 
 memo 
 Please follow up with Lou on this.  It sounds like something the commercial people would be in a good position to answer, so maybe start by finding out if they are already responding, either through Lou or otherwise.  Then get the right people to review and supplement this list.  Thanks. df 
 I appreciate the message, Tom, and by this email am requesting that my clients give this some thought.  Either Mike or I will be back in touch with you shortly.  Thanks again!  DF 
 pls print.  thanks 
 The truth comes out.   - MORONS1.GIF 
 Are you coming?  I think I owe you a beer or two, and since it will be on my expense account, I don't mind paying up!  DF 
 Are you going?  If so, I'll see you there.  DF 
 Sorry you weren't able to join my hunting boondoggle in SoDak!  It was epic. Lots of birds (the wild variety, not pen raised and tied down like at Pheasant Haven!)  We saw literally 1500-2000 birds over three days of hunting, and limited out every day.  Got my first double--two shots, two birds, nothun' but net.  You gonna be at the mgt conf?  I'd love to get caught up with you and share some new tales of woe from the pipeline group.    PS, I met Angie Green yesterday--very sharp young lady.  She said to say hi to you and Nicole.  Adios.  DF 
 Sorry to hear that.  Please convey my disappointment and hopes that all is well with Mark and his clan.  DF 
 Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an LFT deal.  DF 
 pls delete Dorothy's name from the Form 3 and replace it with mine and put in the dates from 1-1-99--12-31-99.  Please print me about 15 of each blank form .  Thanks.   DF 
 Here is that email I told you about last night.  I'm sure Wall Street feels= =20 the same way about the pipeline group.  DF 
 I've talked to Lee Ferrell about this, and it sounds to me like there are serious business reasons (i.e., cost and functionality) not to use the ENA system.  THe "sharing of resources" issue worries me, but might be solvable if the right people are in Networks instead of ENA.  I'll call you tomorrow. DF 
 OK.  DF 
 As we discussed, based on this email and the other information you have given me, I have significant concerns about our ability to use the ENA products discussed below.  Having ENA IT people involved on an ongoing basis in maintaining the software and assisting us in using it would probably constitute a violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum create the appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  As I understand the risk books, etc., confidential information on our various capacity positions would be all over the place and difficult or impossible to firewall off from ENA people working on those books.  If there is some firewall strategy that the ENA folks have in mind, i.e., if those IT people are or will be employed by Networks or Corp., I am eager to listen, but from what I have learned so far, I am not comfortable with our use of the ENA system.  DF 
 As you requested, following are the facts for the media regarding the negotiated rate deals that TW has recently done at rates in excess of the tariff max rate.   Please note that the first two transactions are already public and the following information can be disclosed now.  The third deal has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is.  That filing will be made before Dec. 1, 2000.  General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's maximum tariff rate.  Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997.  (Order issued April 11, 1997, Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par. 61,021).  Pursuant to that authority, TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed at Docket No. RP97-288.  Details on the specific transactions are as follows:  Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading Rate Schedule:  ITS-1 Volume:    30,000/day Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000 Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool Delivery point:  SoCal Topock  Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000 and rate is $.75/MMBtu  Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading Rate Schedule:  LFT Volume:  10,000/day Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000 Receipt point:  Bloomfield Delivery point:  PG&E Topock  All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these transactions.  No other information is available as TW does not comment on specific customer transactions. 
 Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things: 1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law would probably be the best place to start) 2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s to be done.  Thanks df 
 Hey, got my facts together on our Houston gig--we'll be down Sat. Dec. 2 through mon the 4th.  Any chance we could swing by on Sunday and see  you guys?  DF 
 That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing I'm remembering, but I think there is some more specific law related to market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you better not use it.  DF 
 pls give me your comments next week..  thanks  df 
 Looks good--I'm faxing some minor comments.  Give George my best!  DF 
 Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political winds.  I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate.  I also agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under NGA section 4/5.  To challenge the deals under some state law "gouging" theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part, etc.  I'll talk to you and Kathy further tomorrow AM and then we can grab Mike to discuss. Thanks.  DF 
 Here is a good example of the problem to which your research project pertains.  This info. could be devastating in the next rate case ( or sooner) if disclosed.  How comfortable are we with our privilege arguments?  DF 
 Outstanding!!!  Still colder than shit up here--what are you guys even thinking on moving up here????  I'll call you to check out the details later this week.  Thanks. DF 
 Great job.  I'll grab you and Susan Mon. AM to discuss this and her thoughts.  DF 
 fyi.  df 
 This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.  Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK with you?  DF 
 I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate entitiy until we get down the road a ways. 
 Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF 
 Tino implied that it was transferrable, but we'd need to look at the documents to be surre.  DF 
 Approved on behalf of Dari.  The attached document has the dates right--its Nov. 29, 2000 through Dec. 31, 2000.  DF 
 I'll look at it on the plane and talk to you tomorrow.  DF 
 Do I need to do anything re: this?  Thanks. DF 
 First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a (slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF 
 I'm expecting a nastygram from Harris ragging on me for dishing out credit for his idea, but haven't seen anything yet!  DF 
 Lets talk today, susan.  I need to satisfy myself that this is really one of those "shit happens" situations like everyone seems to believe, rather than a situation where we may have a cause of action and some $$$ owed to us by someone.  DF 
 I had a problem approving one from home a couple weeks ago, but I think it works OK now.  May have been a bad phone line.  Thanks.  DF 
 Great--we ought to be able to about close this effort out at this next meeting I hope.  DF 
 pls print.  df 
 Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF 
 A $14 IT deal?  The $14 deal was a sale of operational gas, right?  DF 
 I'll be in South Dakota from the 28th of December through the 3d of January. While there, I can be reached via my voice mail, which I will check daily, or through my cell phone at 402-630-8461.  At all other times, I will be Omaha and reachable at my office number, cell phone or home number of 402-572-8595.  Thanks.  DF 
 Yes.  Sorry I forgot to cc you.  If it got lost in the process, have them send it again, or forward this email to payables as my approval.  thanks df 
 Check out ENE over the last 30 days.  I'm a few more weeks away from retirement.  Do you own any?  DF 
 I'm booked from 10-11, 11:45-1:30 and 2-3.  I can stay after school if necessary.  DF

 Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF 
 Congratulations on the move!  Its great to see a reorg that actually seems to make so much sense!  Thanks again to you and Terry for watching the three stooges on Saturday night.  It was great seeing you guys again and getting the kids a chance to play for a while.  We'd love to return the favor next time you come up to Omaha--the weather is getting real nice right about now!!  DF 
 A team of folks including Dari, Glen Hass, Don Vignaroli, etc have beaten these issues to death--we have a very detailed set of materials summarizing the findings of the group.  Bob Burleson should know that, as I think he was at the meeting when we went over this stuff.  Viggy, did we get the info from our briefing on the matrix to the no-shows like Steve Harris and John Dushinske (and Bob if he was a no show?)  If not, we ought to send it to them and ask them to call for follow up.  DF 
 I'm inclined to agree that its not worth responding to.  They also argued that imbalances should not be dollar valued before netting and trading are available, but that strikes me as an industry wid e policy issue and not a TW specific issue.  Any other thoughts?  DF 
 Give me a call at your convenience and I'll give you a data dump.  DF 
 pls put on my calendar.  df 
 OK.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks df 
 I had assumed that the cost of service underlying the 11-1-99 rates was the most recent data we have handy, but I guess

 What a mess.  Keeping discovery at bay should, obviously, continue to be a very high priority for us.  Let me know if these strange events signal an increased likelihood that Gynberg will be able to pursue discovery.  Thanks. df   STACI HOLTZMAN 12/11/2000 09:06 AM

 Lou Harrison (insurance guy) will call tomorrow--please schedule an appt. at his joint next wk--Wed Thur or Fri.  Preferably 4:00 or later so I can hit him on the way home.  thanks df 
 I wish.  As to your complaint about my failure to tip you off, there were two primary reasons:  (1) if I told you and got caught I'd go to prison, and, more importantly, (2) I had no clue. DF  (its better to be lucky than good!) 
 Dammit Jenkins, don't even joke about stuff like that!  If the market ever realized that I worked here, the stock would go down $10!!!  You think Lay is taking the first step toward Sec. Treas. in the new Bush admin???  That's the rumor I heard a month ago.  Hope all goes well for you in sunny hotlanta. Its 5 below zero here today so your whole Georgia good ole' boy lifestyle thing sounds pretty attractive.  AMF  DF 
 pls print with attachments.  thanks. df 
 Great--I'd be happy to testify if the consensus is that it would help.  Go ahead and draft something up and we can talk soon.  Thanks.  DF 
 Yes as to the question, and good idea on the reh. req.   I'm circulating a draft of the contract required for the compliance filing on the ECS issue this PM.  Thanks. DF 
 You correctly predicted my reaction.  I think we should let sleeping dogs lie.  Also, was it just an oversight that the FERC ignored the unsold capacity that TW controls in evaluating how much of the available capacity that Enron controls?  That conclusion is good for us, if it was intentional. DF 
 Please review this final draft at your earliest convenience and get back to Britt or me with your comments.  Thanks.  Martha, please print it out for me.  Thanks. DF 
 Pls review and give me your OK, then I'll respond to Christine.  Thanks. DF 
 Ann would like to be rotated off.  Thanks.  DF 
 See ENE today?  Glad I didn't quit my day job.  DF 
 pls priint for my 2:00 mtg.  thanks . DF 
 I agree with you that par. 4 doesn't give NMNG anything beyond what the tariff and general contract law gave them.  The "subject to agreement by Transwestern" language is redundant since the previous clause says " by mutual written agreement."  Additionally, its confusing and innacurate because the "provided, however, that" clause isn't even binding if we mutually agree to eliminate it.   I therefore think we ought to take par. 4 out, or at least remove the "provided however" clause.  I don't agree that we can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release.  We can mutually agree to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap. release. I suppose we would need to use cap. release if the termination or reduction of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another shipper, however.  I would propose one change to Par. 3 just to make the discount more clear. The par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary receipts.  I'd add this, after the words "Appendix A" at the end of the current first sentence:  "and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A.  The discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) area."  I'm a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts, and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both the receipt and delivery end of the deal.  Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made.  I'd like to eliminate par. 4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the "provided however" clause.   With these changes, I'm OK with the contract.  Thanks. 
 pls print w/memo.  thanks. DF 
 I'm heading to KC tomorrow for a meeting with Langley and Tino on some goofy project.  Funny thing is, now that he is sitting on $100 mm, I take everything he says pretty damn seriously!   If word gets out, expect another huge dive in ENE price.  DF 
 pls print asap.  thanks. dF 
 You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later. Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF 
 Thats weird, my computer just deleted the recipients from the email below. I'll try again--do you guys still work here?  DF 
 I think we can tell Rich yes, but please confirm that for me.  thanks.  DF 
 I'd love to see us keep the capacity release upside above the discounted rate on all these deals but if we can't get it, we can't get it.  Approved.  DF 
 Bummer.  Never hurts to ask.  I'll cycle on this and get back to you with= =20 follow up if any.  Thanks for your help on this.  DF=20 
 Re:  Dave Foti--this is what I was talking about.  He cranks out some pretty well thought out stuff.  DF 
 For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not volunteering to make that phone call. DF 
 No I'm not in bed.  Please print--I'll be in in an hour or so.  Thnaks.DF 
 FYI.  DF 
 I'm not sure if this is automatic or if you have to actually do something to make sure it happens, but either way, THANK YOU!  Flying on this flight stinks and it would be even worse in the back of the bus!!  DF 
 Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim started.  I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal (even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).  Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do we know him?  I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing. Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D. and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF 
 Attached is a draft of an "operational control agreement" designed to address the concerns stated in FERC's order approving the Gallup project.  We may or may not actually file it as part of the required compliance filing, but will describe it in detail in the "report" FERC ordered us to file.  The substantive terms track the language that is already in the O&M Agreement. Please give me or Susan a call with any questions or comments you may have. We expect to file this by I believe the 12th of Feb.  or so.  Thanks.  DF 
 pls print.  thanks.  DF 
 Mark, I understand we need to act very quickly once we have turned you loose to price the swap.  I think this is a Harris and Nelson call, so lets talk tomorrow.  I'll look at the contracts again to verify our risks in locking in before we are 100% sure we are going ahead with the project.  DF 
 If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this.  We'll need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the "shared facilities."  Also, if you decide to go forward, don't do it until 1-1-2000 so we don't have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this quarter.  Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we'll arrange a briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we'll make sure we understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is up.  Please call with any questions. Thanks.  DF 
 Its a railroad.  Now known as BNSFCN (Burlington Northern Santa Fe Canadian National).  DF 
 ??????  I thought our folks had a pretty clear understanding of their respective jurisdiction and expertise.  Apparently not.  Lets talk about the specifics of this incident when I get back to the office.  Actually, I'll see you tomorrow Lou and maybe we can dial Dot in.  Thanks. DF 
 I'm good on this.  DF 
 The problem is back.  For a while I couldn't send an email to the wrong Steve even if I tried, but now the computer's doing its own thing again.  I'll try to remember to use "steven" but my recollection is that that didn't always work either.  Thanks.  DF 
 How much time did you say you will have????  If you can get through  a tenth of that in 5 minutes, you are much quicker than I!  Also, in an amazing coincidence, your outline looks very similar to MKM's speech for the Canuck gas conference next week.  Good job on both!  DF 
 pls print.  thanks. DF 
 Well, there you have it.  We waited and we blew it.  What a bunch of dummies.  Next time someone calls and gives me a special deal thats only available for a limited time, I'll jump on it!   Kevin, please let me know what Steve, Bill, and Stan ultimately decide to do on this.  Thanks. DF 
 How bout 1?  Thanks. DF 
 pls give that copy of Gorak's sba filing to maria.  I think I left it with you and Mary.  df 
 Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there? We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF 
 Great--the front running ideas now are (1) an operational sale in the San Juan of the 20,000 we recieve there and an offsetting operational purchase (less basis differential) at some other location (i.e., the permian) thus freeing up 20,000/d of physical space on the lateral; or (2) an exchange agreement under which a party takes our 20,000 in the SJ and gives us back the same amount, less basis differential, in the permian.  The SJ 20,000 would still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under someone's transport agreement--in other words it wouldn't be incremental to our 850,000/d of firm transport obligations.  I don't know if this will work yet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna.  I'm eager to talk to Steve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario that Susan researched  a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe there are problems or solutions yet to be considered.  DF 
 I think that is exactly right.  I suspect that the marketing guys could work up a simple formula for determining our course of action depending on the size of the revenue opportunity vs. the power cost/penalty.  Thanks. df 
 I don't see anything controversial in Leslie's outline.  We've done  a lot of thinking about Dynegy's "funny money" argument and I volunteer Maria to work with you and Leslie on making sure ENA's comments are consistent with ours on this and all related issues.  DF

 pls print all this stuff.  thanks df 
 On Thursday last week the Commission eliminated the old "Texas Eastern" rule that required pipelines to obtain prior FERC approval before contracting for transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.  The new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to FERC first.  The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.  Interestingly, the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant to its capacity release program.  The order is silent on whether the price cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.   While we are still reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, I'd emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.   For example, the "Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures" dated Feb. 3, 2000 provides Dave and Steve with authority up to $250,000 on operating expense obligations.  Please contact me if you have any questions on this matter.  DF 
 I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral. If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything possible to expedite these efforts.  DF 
 Here is the latest on timetable on Gallup.  Susan, please get your edits on the draft to Donna and me by tomorrow.  (call me if you need more guidance on what I have in mind).   Donna or Keith, please let me know what additioonal information you are waiting on and what the likely timetable for filing is. Also, Keith, what was the answer from ops/planning on whether unloading the 20,000 of fuel from the San Juan would help with more flexibility or capacity?  If you haven't been able to get a meaningful answer, let me know who to call and I'll try. 
 When you guys give me a new computer, can I get a (smaller) laptop with some kind of docking station???  I don't need a desktop if I get a good laptop.. I'd suggest we keep the IBM laptop as the department's roving laptop if it is upgradable to Windows 2000.  Thanks.  DF 
 Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.  I'll give you a call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.   The plan that makes the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.  We'll simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January as Stan suggested.  I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial hurdles.   DF 
 Way cool.  DF 
 Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or $10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA guys.  Thanks.  DF 
 Cool.  Do we have any most favored nations problem when we start doing backhaul service or have we already crossed that bridge with the EFBH deal? DF 
 Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the line?  If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal. border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 775 lbs?  Lets talk to McShane tomorrow.  Thanks.. DF  e 
 Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking etc. We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on, there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF 
 Pls get me in on the meetings with Galasinsi and Mcchane. df 
 Julie--pls forward to Danny.  I've had trouble the last couple of days getting emails to go through to him.  Am I doing something wrong? 
 I have been typing in his name and letting the computer address it.  I've now added his "@enron.com" address to my address book, so lets see if that does the trick.  Thanks!  DF 
 I'm glad to have Tino talk to him direct--tee it up that way if you can. Tino's new number is 913-441-1800 (ext. 109).  Thanks Kevin and have a great holiday!! DF

 Do we need to give notice to customers before we shut in receipt points due to off-spec gas?  Sec. 44 of the NN tariff implies to me that if a customer's gas has too much water, for example, we can shut it in at any time without notice.  Please confirm ASAP.  DF
