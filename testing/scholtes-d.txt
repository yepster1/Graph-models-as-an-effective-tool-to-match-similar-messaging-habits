 Sales to PGE:  10/3	After you put in the lending for this day, I agree we are still out by 150 mw.  Its down to two schedules; can you check to see what you show for the Montana buy/resale.  This should be 32 peak everyday.  The other for the day is our pge system to grizzly this should be 26 mw peak.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you.  10/5 & 10/6   You show 200 more llh....I don't know why????  10/8	The 200 mw you show llh should be a total of 256 (32 llh due to colstrip).  Call me to go thru the hourly at your system to find our 2 mw descrepancy.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you.  10/9  You show 8 mw @ 24.20 under To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.  Don't know what that is?  You also only show it on one side??  I'll send more when i get thru it!!  diana 
 Leslie,  I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.  Diana Scholtes West Desk 503-464-3807 
 Michael,  I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.  So I apologize, I haven't been in town.  Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.  Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.  If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.  You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).  I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.  Thank you for your time.  Hope your holidays were good.  Regards,  Diana Scholtes 
 Hello John!  I appreciate the recommendation, but I am not in the position right now to make a move.  If they are interested in discussing a position h
