 came down with the croup.  Hence I'm staying here to take care of her cuz Dad's out of town also.  Real bummer because there's a lot of fun going to happen up there!  Have a good time!  Maybe we can go hiking around here!  Diana 
 9/23	Bill C. fixed this day and we check  9/24	To MPC-EPMI Colstrip s/b priced with the .10 cent adder peak & off peak To EPMI MC Memo {800 mw @ 18.40} s/b priced with the 1.50 parking/lending adder * OK for the hard part!  our nets are ok for the balance of the problem but they aren't priced correctly. We have a 101 peak plus a 25 peaker (15-20) totaling 1766 mwh's that s/b priced @ 20.55 Then we parked/lended for a total of 590 mwh that s/b priced @ 21.95. You have them dispursed between several accounts:	 To BPA-EPMI (PGE sys)= 497 mw To PGE CA EPMI Sale = 1459 @ 20.55 & 400 @ 21.55  Purchases= $ 156,755.00 Sales= $ 147,439.00  9/25	I BELIEVE OUR INDICES ARE OFF- I SHOW 18.98 PEAK & 16.60 OFF PEAK????  Every account you have on this day is off. Or maybe I have the wrong index! 
 Hi Amy!  So glad to have you back!  I talked to Grace this morning and she said it was ups'd yesterday.  I submitted it last week, so I'm not sure why the delay.  Please let me know if you don't
