ohn, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.  Diana Scholtes West Desk 503-464-3807 
 Michael,  I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.  So I apologize, I haven't been in town.  Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.  Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.  If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.  You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).  I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.  Thank you for your time.  Hope your holidays were good.  Regards,  Diana Scholtes 
 Hello John!  I appreciate the recommendation, but I am not in the position right now to make a move.  If they are interested in discussing a position here in the NW, I would be more interested in that.  I hope everything is going well for you.  Keep in touch!  Diana 
 Will,  Can you tell me what day was the last to be rolled in Auto Scheduler?  I'm trying to go back into December to balance Enpower for Settlement purposes.  Thank you,  Diana Scholtes 503-464-3807 
 What we are looking at is cleaning up for December.  So the schedule strips have already been created.  For settlement purposes, we have to go in and clean house.  So it wouldn't help to change the deal in Deal Entry and  I'm not even sure that we can do it anyway because of deal preservation.  So we are looking at a time strip for example Dec 8-31 to zero out "Counter party".  I will be talking to John tomorrow morning to find out more about the West Bankruptcy book.  Don't know anything about it.  Thanks again,  Diana

 Deal # 614339.1 in the LTCA book has been changed from a fixed price of $158 to $155.  This is due to us not facilitating and paying for the CDWR In-Area sleeve.   Diana 
 In discussion with Bob Floyd with CDWR and Mike Brommer from TID, Enron will continue its obligations to TID with a delivery @ NP-15.  CDWR and TID have entered into the $3 In-Area facilitation between themselves.  If you have any further questions, please call me at 503-464-3807.  Thanks again!  Diana Scholtes Enron- West Portland

 Bill,  There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.  ds
