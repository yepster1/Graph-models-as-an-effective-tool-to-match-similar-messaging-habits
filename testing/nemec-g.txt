igher esteem than before.  At least that's one way to gain the respect of your clients.  So how is the great Northwest? Have your told grandparents about the wonderful time you had in Cabo with some strange guy walking around in your shoes.  Some details are probably better left out.  I am about out of here.  Take care and I will talk to you later.  Gerald 
 Attached is the revised agreement with Utah added.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Attached is a redlined version of the schedules with changes for the sales/use taxes on EMS materials.  All other supplements to the schedules remain unchanged. 
 Eva,  All the references are conditional upon term conversion occurring prior to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to closing.  We plan on leaving the references as they exist.  Let me know if you have any questions.      Eva Neufeld@ENRON 09/16/2000 03:50 PM 
 Jere,  I have reviewed the draft and everything looks fine except for the $10 million cap.  Dave and I had discussed a $2 million cap.  I would request that the $2 million cap be inserted.  Please let me know if you have any questions.      "Bates, Jere" <jbates@tristategt.org> 09/18/2000 12:02 PM 
 Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules incorporating the comments sent by NBP this weekend and also reflecting the executed Lost Creek amendments.  Please review. 
 Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules to the Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Also attached, for the sake of completeness, are the supplements to the schedules.  The supplements are the same as prior versions, except for some changes to the title defects schedules for the Maverick, Box Draw, and Caballo systems.  I attempted to redline the schedules for the title defects, but it redlined the whole list.  The only change of substance added was a new Wyoming DOT road crossing permit to Maverick.  Also taken off were references to the documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was contained in brackets and began "[See Attached ....].  That information was for the right of way agents in Gillette so that they knew what documents had been prepared for them.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached are clean versions of the 20/20 Schedules 
 I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never turned myself into a human candle.  I did spend several years as an altar boy.  We got to wear those cool outfits also.  How are you doing?  Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.  This is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.      "Emmye" <emmye@dracospring.com> 09/19/2000 04:42 PM 
 Hi Kelly,    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does a flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.  I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably go.      "Kelly OBrien" <kjobrien@duke-energy.com> 09/18/2000 10:53 PM 
 I will check with my bro, to see if he is interested and let you know.  Get some sleep.   Talk at ya later.      "Mark Miller" <mmiller3@austin.rr.com> 09/20/2000 11:06 AM 
 Are you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from you.  Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down to Cabo for good. 
 Craig,  Attached is a short outline concerning the approach we discussed earlier.  Please review and let me know if you agree. 
 Hi Katie,  Remember me.  Not sure if this is still your email address, but thought I would check and see.  Hope you are doing well and school is going well.  If you are still out there drop me a line! 
 Hi Mom,   Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  I have just been pretty busy at work and on the weekends.  Seems like there is not enough hours in the day.  I did go down to Cabo for a week.  It was a blast.  We partied way too much.  Everything else is going fine.  My roommate moved in at the beginning of September.  So far so good.  Hope everything is going well down in CC.  Love yall and talk to you later.  Gerald      Edward Nemec <ednemec@earthlink.net> 09/08/2000 08:04 AM

 Might try this for the bar, while at the bar. 
 GT,  I am planning on driving in Sat.  I will probably leave Houston around 9 am.  Should be in Austin at lunch time.  I can't remember exactly how to get to your casa.  Can you drop me some directions again.  Thanks.

 Paul,  We need to plan on getting together sometime.  When and how long are you going to be in San Diego once you get back from stomping out the "angry red horde"?

 Hi Katie,    Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.  I have been out of town for awhile.  Good to hear from you again.  I understand about the summer.  Sometimes we get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing.  I had a good summer.  My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado in August.  Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.  I spent four days up there.  My whole family made the trip, so that was cool. The weather up there is awesome.  I played around of golf and I don't think it ever got above about 75 degrees.  They had the reception at the Stanley Hotel.  This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the inspiration to write the Shining.  No weird events occurred at the reception though.  I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.  I spent 8 days down there with some friends.  Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and dancing.  Not necessarily in that order though.  I was a little worried about being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying till 4 am and sleeping til noon.  Enron is going well.  We just closed another big deal last week, so the pressure is off for now again.  There will surely be another next quarter. Can't wait .  I feel for you concerning statistics.  Actually that was one of the courses that gave me the most problems in engineering school.  I must admit I probably didn't try as hard as I should have.  I just hated the course so much that I just wanted to get it over with.  Hang in there.   You will get through it.  Is this your last semester?  If I remember correctly, I thought you were going to graduate in December.  It is really good to hear from you again.  Take care and drop me a note when you get a chance.  Gerald 
 Attached is a revised nomination letter incorporating comments received. Please review 
 Hi Dee,  I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.  I hope everything with you and your family is as well as it can be right now.  I will say a prayer for yall.  I am doing good.  Staying busy with work as you suggested.  Actually we closed our big deal last Thursday.  That will allow my hours to become somewhat more normal in the near future.  They are planning a trip to reward those who worked so hard on this deal.  Guess where? Cabo.  Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.  They won, fortunately.  It was good to see some old friends and hang out.   I wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they can lowball you on the cash.  Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.  Take care and talk to you later.     "Karry Howton" <howton.k@ghc.org> 09/22/2000 05:19 PM 
 A redlined version with my changes.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Barbara,  I put hard copies of these documents in your chair. 
 Attached is a rough draft of a response letter to Wildhorse concerning the nominations.  Barbara and I are still reviewing, so there will be some further changes, but in the interest of time, I thought I would send this out for everyone's review. 
 GT,  I think I will probably come in tonight since the game is so early.  Are you guys going to try and buy tickets at the gate for BB?    Email back with your phone numbers, so I can call if anything changes.  Talk at ya later.  G 
 Sounds like your little cousin is continuing to strike out on the airline tickets.  It really breaks my heart to see the once great web master fall so far. Maybe we should have assigned him the task of color coordinating his pants and shirts for the trip. 
 Not sure if you or someone in your group already had seen this. 
 Scott,  Attached is the memo from local counsel in Denver.  Per Barbara's voice mail, both her and I agree with the content of the memo.  Craig is an experienced litigator in Denver.  Please review and let's discuss. 
 Sorry for the delay.  Here is the letter 
 The pictures were very amusing.  Thanks for sending those along.  Looks like you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.  I especially like the candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.  Whoa, got to start working out and shed the love handles.  I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe since that is where you guys hung out most of the time.  Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.  I really don't follow Texas but I do follow the Astros.  I think everybody is just happy the season is over with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.  The Astros were pretty horrible this year.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this weekend?  I know that is probably impossible.  Thanks for the pics again and I'll talk to you later.  Gerald 
 I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period prior to the effect date of the agreement.  Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.  Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.      Mark Whitt@ENRON Sent by: Mark Whitt@ENRON 10/02/2000 10:34 AM 
 fyi. 
 Davis,  This actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the Big 12 Game.  However, just because I at one time worked at the Posse doesn't mean my character should continue to be called into question.      Davis Thames@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/04/2000 09:27 AM 
 FYI,  The call to Kinder may not be needed. 
 Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.  Please note the italicized sections of the CSA.  I am not sure what the terms quoted to Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to energy pricing.  We may want to leave these sections blanks for now.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 The form of right of way looks good.  Go ahead and forward to the land owner. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my revisions.  The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded earlier via email.  Sorry for the delay.  I will be at the ENA Legal Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.  Please leave a voicemail if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Attached is a letter to TW notifying them of the CDEC rate increase and requesting their election on the pricing adjustment.  Please review.  We need to get this to TW asap.

 I think you need this. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the ENA's IT Agreement on Lost Creek.  The revisions incorporate Chris Hoekenga's comments.  Please review and let me know if this looks acceptable.  If OK we can forward to BR for their final review. 
 What's up rude-dog.  Haven't heard any new recruiting news.  I think it is going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season.  I was up in Denver this past week and talked to Jessica Wentworth.  She said you have been exploring the Australian countryside.  Bet there is some amazing stuff down under.  Anyway, drop me a note and let me know how its going.  I know I have asked this before, but when are you getting into town?  We need to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival.

 Did you take the LSAT and kick its butt already?  I thought you were scheduled to take that recently.  You are probably wishing you have more stuff to study on the weekends. 
 I am forwarding these to you with the condition that you are not allowed to send these to any of your uppity OU cronies.    - TexasFight.jpg - Score+Board.jpg 
 How dare you take such a tone with my counsellor.  You're just bitter that you have squandered all rights to your furniture.  Face it, your furniture likes me better anyway now. 
 GT,  How is it going?  Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took from OU.  Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.  I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.  I might have my brother and another friend with me.  How are you set for space.  Those guys could crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.  If it is a problem, just let me know and we can make other arrangements.  Talk at ya later  G 
 Hi Katie,  You guys would love Cozumel.  Short flight, very cheap, and lots of fun.  If any of you Scuba Dive, Cozumel has some of the best diving in the world.  I had a blast down there.  Hope your Stats. class is going OK.  Unfortunately, I think that is one of those classes the just requires more effort than most classes.  Work hasn't been too busy for me lately.  However, I know that will change as we get closer to the end of the year.  I do have a trip to Spain planned for November.  Some friends and I will be going over the Thanksgiving week.  We are flying into Madrid and will also go to Lisbon, Portugal.  Other than that we will work our way around the coast on the South of Spain.  I am really looking forward to it.  Hope everything else is going well for you.  Are you sure you don't want to go for your Phd once you graduate.      : -) 
 Was curious if you heard anything further on this?  I haven't called again. Debating whether I should.  Any plans to go up to Estes anytime soon?     Sharon Snyder <ssnyder@shelton.org> 10/12/2000 02:54 PM 
 Things are going good in legal.  I am getting to work on some interesting stuff.  I just finished working on a compressor deal with Mark Courtney.  It was an asset and finance deal.  I got to work with the finance commercial and legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time.  It is hard to keep up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of knowledge at this point.  Tense but fun.  I didn't see the any of the high school all star games.  I heard Babers and Turner both looked very good in the Texas- California game.  Sounds like they were covering some 6'5" bad asses from California and pretty much shut them down.  At least that most other peoples opinion.  Sounds like Kenny Hayter look pretty good.  Leading Texas rusher.  He sounds like a power runner not a real juker.  I am really worried about the NC State game.  It would suck to lose the home opener, but I think that is a very real possibility.  Their quarterback sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers, ala UCLA.  I still think we will at least go 7-4 probably 9-2 best case.  Your right though.   If we fall flat with 5-6 or something it will slow the momentum Mack is building. I just don't think that will happen.  Mack is too smart and can really get these kids to overchieve.  I think his players believe and are motivated to play hard.  Mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like James Brown.  When you think about it though, Mack following Mackovic is really going to pay dividends in the long run.  Mack Brown and Greg Davis weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at UNC.  But Mackovic had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which Mack and Greg picked right up on.  Now we have kids like Mock, Williams, and Johnson wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone.  I like it.  It is going to be fun in about 2 years with the quality of kids we are now getting.  I will think about the groups I have worked with and let you know on any areas to go.  I have worked a lot with Larry Lawyer in the finance group and know he is looking work people.  I don't know if this was the same stuff you did in Denver or the same group.   Might be.  Those guys do work a lot of hours.  Almost as bad as attorneys.  I will give it some thought.  Well, all for now.  Keep in touch.  I am glad you are going to be back in Houston.  We will have some fun.  I want to hear all about how much you really like Australian women or more specifically, how much they like you.  G$

 Mark,  Attached are riders to be added to the CIG  Confidentiality Agreement.  Please forward these for review to the proper persons at Coastal.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 We should again nominate to NWPL .  In our nomination we can state that if Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to Questar solely to mitigate damages.

 Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the letter such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event that Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages. Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it there.  From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.      "Ken" <kckrisa@apex2000.net> 10/23/2000 02:37 PM Please respond to kckrisa 
 Hi Janel,  We have a couple of things on the agenda.  Friday night is Fastball at the Engine Room.  We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House prior to the show.  Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer.  Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.  Some placed called Americas near Enron Field.  Never heard of it.  There are about 3 other bands. Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.  Show starts at 7 pm.  Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.  There are about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.  If you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.  Let me know.      Janel Guerrero@ENRON 10/24/2000 08:31 AM 
 No acid rock, just good easy listening tunes.  Fastball had the hit about 2 years ago called The Way.  Toadies; they just rock.  We will probably dress as under-appreciated, under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys.     Janel Guerrero@ENRON 10/24/2000 10:58 AM 
 I would be happy to handle this, unless you want to.  Let me know.  Thanks. 
 Can you place these on my calendar please.  Thanks. 
 Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.  The right to match option is a little less drastic than the "saving sharing" we discussed.  The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.  We can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Attached for your review is a form of assignment for the Trailblazer Precedent Agreement between ENA and Trailblazer.  This assigns the PA from ENA to J.M. Huber Corporation. 
 A note from Bieraugel.  We need to go out and see these guys when we get a chance.  Hang in there.  Things will start to come around, it is just going to take some time.

 Hi Sophie,  I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.  I will have extra Sherry on mine.  How is it going?  I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with you at the Brown Bar.  I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get creative when the circumstances require.    I was moving a little slow the next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant.  Did you have a good weekend?  I didn't do anything real exciting for the weekend before Halloween.  Went to a concert that had 4 bands.  One of them is a band from Austin called Vallejo.  Heard of them?  Now tell me the truth.  Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?  Drop me a line when you get a chance.  Gerald

 A few interesting deals.  Working on some products for Enron's B2B internet trading site.  "www.enrononline.com"  The site was actually developed out of our London office.  Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace. Some other trading deals as well.  I usually get a pretty mixed bag of projects to work.  It has been very busy the last couple of days.  Sophie Therapy?  That sounds extremely interesting.  Is it good for most of your normal life crisis type issues?  I might need some now and again.  I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state was not clearest it could have been.  Are you a student at UT Law?  Forgive me for my mental lapses.  OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type substance.  Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not sure about the Yorkshire.  Might help to wash it down with a nice pint.  Take care, Gerald.    "Sophie Davenport" <sophiedavenport@hotmail.com> 10/31/2000 10:31 AM

 If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.  Otherwise Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's control.  But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the agreement now.      Mark Whitt@ENRON Sent by: Mark Whitt@ENRON 11/02/2000 05:42 PM 
 I haven't answered him yet.  I just plan to let him know that the contracts should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter. Any thoughts? 
 Mike,  Still working on it.  Should have a draft by late Monday or Tuesday. Sorry about the delay.      Michael Eiben 11/03/2000 09:17 AM 
 Ron,  Attached is the assignment with my change redlined.  If you want to discuss, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.  Thanks. 
 FYI.  We are currently executing a CA with Tom Brown to begin review of the system for a possible purchase by Crescendo or Enron North America. 
 That is it!  I don't know the how and when, but I intend to devote the rest of my life to bringing down Stoops and the OU football program.  You will rue the day my friend.     Paul.Pfeffer@bakerbotts.com 11/06/2000 08:24 AM 
 I will remove the open season reference.  Some pipeline tariffs do refer to open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to remove it.  The terms you referenced are defined in the product description.  The EOL access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on the counterparty.     Colleen Sullivan 11/06/2000 12:42 PM 
 Attached are a redlined revised version of the GTC and the Product Description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions. Carlos, I made a few slight changes to the product description you sent earlier today   Please review. 
 Russell,  The 2nd Huber transaction was executed and Huber is contractually bound to take assignment of the transportation.  We have gotten approval of the assignment form from the Pipeline and expect to execute the assignments and capacity release documents with Huber next week.  The capacity release document just specifies the details of the capacity release.  Huber is bound by the 2nd transaction to accept our release.    I will let you know when these sets of documents are executed.  Let me know if you have any questions.      Russell Diamond 11/03/2000 11:08 AM 
 Ken,  Attached is the form of ROW Agreement and Exhibit B that goes along with it. 
 I am composing this as we speak.  Should have a draft shortly.      Michael J Legler@ENRON Sent by: Michael J Legler@ENRON 11/06/2000 08:32 AM 
 Carlos,  Made one change.  Wanted to be clear that Buyer's bid shall reflect the Contract Price, Period of Delivery etc.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached are redlines of the latest revisions.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Mark,  Attached is the final GTC and  product description for our capacity release EOL product. 
 Hi Marsha,    How is it going?  Nothing really exciting since Cabo.  Just work.  I am about to go to Spain for  8 days.  Should be fun.  Amazingly, I may be going back to Cabo in December for a business trip.  Don't ask me how I pulled that off.  Are you ready to go back and use your time share?   Good to hear from you.  Tell Shannon hello.  Take care.     Marsha Lybra <make_up_pro@yahoo.com> 11/06/2000 06:17 PM 
 Attached is the final version of the GTC for the EOL Capacity Release. 
 Carlos,  Looks fine to me.  Thanks. 
 Hi Melissa,  Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they keep you busy at V&E.  Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group.  Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, but I might know them.  Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location?  In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!   Gerald 
 Attached is a redline with the changes per my discussion with Colleen. Please review. 
 Greg,  Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the discussion we had yesterday.  I left the reimbursement provision open with only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the interconnect in some form.  I made some assumptions about equipment that either party would install, however this can easily be changed.  I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.  I think this would be best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront payment before we buy or build anything.  Take a look at the draft and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Revised GTC 
 Attached is the revised GTC based on the latest discussion concerning secondary points.  Attached is a clean and redlined version. 
 One more revision to the GTC.  Few changes based on my discussion with Carl this morning.  I have attached a clean and redlined copy.  The redline is compared against the version prior to the secondary point discussion for Colleen's benefit.  I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective unless Dick or Colleen had any comments. 
 Eric, The agreement needs to be bi-directional.  The subject is an exchange of information concerning Petroglyph's transportation contract Colorado Interstate Gas Company.  Paul is going to provide the date of the contract and the contract #. 
 Sorry for the delay.  Please review the attached draft.  If it looks OK we can send to Ken for execution.        Joan Quick 11/09/2000 01:38 PM 
 Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob Vila's "This Old House".  Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you "commoners" like to refer.  Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside of 2 days.  Matt,  If you are still gassy by next week, you will be rooming with Eric and Jen.     jennifer-gillaspie@reliantenergy.com 11/09/2000 02:56 PM 
 By the way, it should be "two knuckleheads" instead of "to". 
 Attached is the draft.  Please review.  I left a question about the cash-out index.  Please let me know what is appropriate. 
 Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.  I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point. That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.  South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?      "Beckworth, Melissa" <mbeckworth@velaw.com> 11/09/2000 11:59 AM 
 Joan,  I am going to make your noted change and forward executables to Crescendo.     Joan Quick 11/09/2000 04:19 PM 
 Tommorrow at 2:00 or later works for me.  Thanks 
 Mark,  Attached are clean versions of the set of documents to be executed by Huber.      The following are redlines copies of the documents that were changed from our prior versions.       Mark,  A couple of notes:  1.  In the capacity release agreement - Are the volumes specified in Section 2.1 correct?  Or do these need to be grossed up for fuel? 2.  In Section 2.4, I took out any requirement of Huber to release WIC Capacity back to ENA if the start date under the purchase agreement occurs later than the start of the term of the WIC Capacity Release from ENA to Huber which we will effectuate soon.  Is this correct? 
 Hey,  Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you are in town this week.  The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?  G      kjobrien@duke-energy.com 11/10/2000 01:24 PM

 It would probably be easiest for me to mail them to you.  What is your address?      kjobrien@duke-energy.com 11/13/2000 02:04 PM 
 FYI,  This is how the capacity release product will look on EOL. 
 Mary,  Thanks for the invite to the Open House.  Unfortunately, I will be out of the country on vacation next week.  Have a Happy Thanksgiving. 
 You are very welcome!  I enjoyed it.  Thanks for the name of the city.  We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so we'll try to check it out.  Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be interesting?  Probably won't be able to find turkey, dressing, or american football anywhere.   Any fun plans for the Thanksgiving holiday?     "Beckworth, Melissa" <mbeckworth@velaw.com> 11/14/2000 02:49 PM 
 Works for me.  Thanks. 
 Hey that sounds like a better idea.  I will give the tickets to Shawna today.  I have them in my briefcase.  You can give me the $$ later.  The tickets are $40 each.      kjobrien@duke-energy.com 11/14/2000 11:59 AM

 Hey Melissa,  I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow. We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I guess I'll get through them.  Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and at the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold my tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.  We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you told me at lunch!  Take care,  Gerald 
 Hello!  Yes, I leave for Spain tomorrow at 1:30.  We arrive in Madrid about 8 am on Sat. Morning.  We will be in Madrid a couple of days, then spend our time in some towns south of Madrid for about 3 days.    The last couple of days we will be in Lisbon, Portugal.  Back in Houston next Monday.    Should be a good time.  I will let you guys know all about it at Christmas time.  Sounds like yall had a fun trip to Big Bend.  I have wanted to see the McDonalds Observatory.  That sounds pretty cool.  Anyway,  thanks for the updates and I will talk to you as soon as I get back.  Gerald      Edward Nemec <ednemec@earthlink.net> 11/16/2000 10:40 AM 
 I'm back.  I will review and comment on their responses.      Mark Knippa 11/27/2000 11:11 AM 
 Thanks for handling this while I was out.      Roger Balog 11/17/2000 03:26 PM 
 Mark,  I made the change in attached note.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 GT  I was actually in Spain all of Thanksgiving week.  Took a little vacation time.    That game sounds like it was an awesome one.  Nothing better than beating the f#$% out of the ags.  What's going on with you brother.  G     "Townsend, George" <gtownsend@manorisd.net> 11/21/2000 10:02 AM 
 I have not received this back yet.  I will call Ken today.     Joan Quick 11/28/2000 04:27 PM 
 Ken,  I sent, via fedex, an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago. The agreement appointed ENA as Crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.  Wanted to see if you have reviewed and executed yet? 
 Attached is a letter to Wildhorse consenting to the assignment of Crescendo's gathering agreements from Wildhorse to Tom Brown.  The letter reserves all our rights for Wildhorse's breach.  Also attached is a letter for December nominations into Questar reserving our rights.  Please review and provide any comments. 
 The letter looks fine Nicole.  Only checked it for form and not substance since I didn't have the agreement to which it is referring.      Nicole Cortez@ENRON Sent by: Nicole Cortez@ENRON 11/30/2000 11:20 AM 
 Attached is the letter.  Please review.  I am still giving it one read over. 
 I made one small change, but this one is ready to go as far as I am concerned. 
 The attached redline document includes the various language changes we discussed today and some other small changes.  These are in addition to the action items that EES was going to pursue. 
 This is the latest draft.  EES is also making some further changes (discussed yesterday) which aren't reflected in this version. 
 I am glad you asked me to lunch today.  I do enjoy spending time with you even though at times it is tough and our conversations are hard right now.  I do Love You so much and have a Vision. 
 Jere,  I have the confidentiality agreements fully executed on our side.  What is your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.  Thanks. 
 Hi MB,  Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see if you would want to meet for a drink after work today? 
 Mark,  I reviewed the CSA for our obligations.  They are as follows:  1.  ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule.  2.  If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW to develop a manual system to accomplish the same.  ECS will keep TW whole on any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system.  This provision was written very generally.      Mark Knippa 12/01/2000 10:45 AM 
 I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with everything else. 
 I can't hear you!! La La La La La La La..................... 
 No problem.  I figured you weren't feeling well.  Sorry to hear that you are still sick.  You might want to call the doc.  I have been able to described my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me (Antibiotics or similar).  Good luck with Global Markets.  Sounds like you had a lot of good opportunities.  I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a better originator if you ever want to go back to origination.  I am pretty open right now for lunch.  Maybe Wednesday.  Let me know.      Lisa Nemec 12/04/2000 09:14 AM 
 Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and sound from Spain.  Spain is really a neat country.  Very charming.  So I got James' name huh?  Who got my name in the drawing?  When is everyone coming in for the holiday?  I am planning on coming down the 23rd. 
 Dan,  Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated. 
 I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.  We have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 year period, with no response from Wildhorse.  We need to reinforce the curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits. I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending. 
 Attached is my revised letter.  Please call with any questions. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the following:  1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only remedies. 2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent with each other.  The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss. 
 Attached is the revised letter based on Chris' voicemail on Friday.  I also added a 30 day window during which ENAP must provide the data to Enron. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Note that we still need to legal entity's name from the South America office. 
 We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good.  I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it though.  Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in Mississippi.      kjobrien@duke-energy.com 12/10/2000 07:10 PM 
 Alan,  Attached is a redline version of the assignment with the changes we discussed.  I also added the geographic location difference language to the Buyer's Daily Obligation section to make it bi-lateral.  Let me know if you have any questions (713) 853-3512. 
 Attached is a list of the contracts which I don't have copies.

 Attached is a redline and clean version of the revised confirm.  Please disregard prior version of the confirm.  The changes reflect the new Precedent Agreement with Trailblazer.

Let me know if you have any questions (713) 853-3512.   Please print three executables of each assignment.  Thanks. 
 I will be revising the Capacity Release and Agreement and the existing Trailblazer Assignment that Huber currently has to reflect the Transaction just completed today.  Mark,  you probably should make Huber aware of this if they are not already so.  Thanks.      Chris Meyer 12/13/2000 04:41 PM
