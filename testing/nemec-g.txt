 enter into a defintive agreement(s) for the compression services".  Please make the change.  Let me know if you need anything further. 
 Sounds like you have been busy.  Work sucks.  Everybody is really stunned and depressed.  Plus, I have been sick since Sunday.  I have missed a couple of days of work.  Not a good week for the G.    Sorry to be such a bummer.  Anyway, glad that you like Lucinda.  She does good work.  We'll catch up this weekend. 
 Kyle,  Do you have any information on this waste disposal site?  Apparently there is a meeting on November 15th to assess each party's liability for cleanup and Louisiana Resources Company is named.  Is anybody working on this? 
 Attached is the letter with my comments. 
 Attached is the letter with my comments redlined.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Darren,  Please review the attached ASAP. 
 Paul,  Attached is the Kennedy Amendment.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Kennedy. 
 Attached is the final version of the Master. 
 I added to the language we discussed. 
 Attached is the structure with my comments.  Concerning the earlier question.  It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.  Thus the rights should be leased from both the surface owner and the mineral owner to be sure.  I revised the transaction sheet to reflect this.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Chris,  Attached are driving directions to Nicor's Troy Grove site.  Per our discussions, please verify whether the site is in Illinois Power's territory. 
 Attached are the consent to assignment letters. We will need two executables of each.  Let me know if you will be the one sending these out for execution. 
 Robert,  The original contribution agreement called for Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. to acquire consent for these assignments.  They were required to use "all reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents".  To the extent they did not do so, ENA should not be liable for the $25,000 per month.  I assume Hugh Connett at Bridgeline is the proper person contact person at Bridgeline.  What is the current status of this $25,000 per month bill.  Has Bridgeline invoiced us? 
 Attached is the guaranty with my comments.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is an amended and restate Torch confirm.  The Exhibit was revised to add two more points.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Judy Thorne had sent out all earlier documents.  I don't know who she sent them to.  Nelson should know. 
 I am OK with their comments.  Who is the correct "Counterparty" for this guaranty? 
 Attached are David's insurance comments.  I agree with his mark-ups.  Feel free to contact David directly to discuss. 
 Please see attached I added language concerning the firmness of that portion converted to a fixed price.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Art,  Per our phone conversation, attached is the revised language for Section 4.4 of the Master Firm Agreement.  Please review and if acceptable, we will prepare executables and forward for signature. "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Section 4.4 shall only allow for offset, set off, or recoupment between Company and Customer, excluding Customer's PNM Gas Services division." 
 Rudwell,  Attached is the guaranty.  Please print out 1 copy for Randy's signature. 
 I am fine with the language.  We will prepare executables. 
   Please review. 
 Attached is the final letter version.  I am OK with the wiring instructions. 
 I agree with your summary. 
 Brandi,  Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement for Torch.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Stacy Dickson is taking this one. 
 I am OK with the matrix.  Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by Enron and Counterparties.  Nelson,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals? 
 Clement,  Attached is the form of guaranty we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ken,  Attached is the form of guaranty from Enron Corp.  This guaranty is currently be routed for approval. 
 Ken, Below is the revised language for the restriction on activities paragraph in the Cash Sale Form  The Property is restricted in that no activity using explosives or other high-power detonating devices may be conducted on the Property within 500 feet of the storage well facility of Vendor located near the Property that would fracture or cause subsurface movement to the storage well facility of Vendor.  Additionally, Buyer shall erect and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, a suitable chain-link fence between Vendor's retained adjacent property and the purchased Property. 
  Keith,  Could you look at this form and scrub it for Louisiana law issues. 
  FYI 
 For your review. 
 Chris,  Attached is the document to which Russell and I have agreed.  Next step is for us to get signed and fax to Russell.  Do you have the tract descriptions that Gulf forwarded?  Does Dave? 
 Ken,  We are in receipt of your revised sale form.  We will review.  I also need the following items by today to fully complete my review.  1.  Any comments you have to the restriction language I proposed. 2.  Draft of the Board Resolution you added to the Act of Sale. 3.  Any other comments you have.  Please forward this information ASAP. 
 FYI,  The latest. 
 Dan,  This is the only transport agreement I found in that directory. 
 Chris,  The letter was signed and faxed to Gulf at approximately 5 pm today. 
 Lisa,  My only comments would be in the Firm Transport section.  Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as "ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG".  As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements). 
 Attached is the revised guaranty form.  Let me know if you need anything else for execution. 
 Attached is a redline of the Act of Sale with my comments.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will draft the resolution this afternoon. 
 Mark/Lance,  Attached is a legal risk memo concerning the sale of land in Louisiana by the ENA Upstream Group (Jean Mrha - Commerical Contact).  The memo will be attached to a DASH which is being circulated for signature today.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ken,  Per our discussion attached are the drafts of revised Act (redlined with my comments) and the Board Resolution for your review. 
 See attached.  I took a guess at the payment timing and our involvement in the construction process.  Do we want to let Jim, review that section also?  I am trying to leave the office by 12 tomorrow.  Any comments ASAP would be appreciated.  Upon receipt of comments, I will forward to Bill Howell. 
 Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:  1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000. 2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. 3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info? 4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.  Do you agree, Robert?  To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's 40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.  Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America Corp. 
 For your review is the draft Construction Expedition Letter per our discussions Monday. 
 Nora,  The notes were paid off.  We do need to cancel the originals.  Let me know if I need to do anything. 
 Attached are the documents we discussed.  I have a attached a clean and redline version of the Act of Sale, compared against the prior version we sent.  Upon your final approval, we will prepare executables. 
 Eric,  Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. owns the other 60%.  The LP is governed by a management committee with two member from Enron and two from Texaco.  I can be your contact for Louisiana Resources.  However, as I stated earlier, I need to know which Louisiana Resources you are talking about.  Is it Louisiana Resources Company or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership.  For Bridgeline the contact would be Robert D. Morgan.  His phone number is 713-345-6374. 
 Resending.  Thanks. 
 Attached are my Louisiana counsel's comments to our ROW form.  I agree with his changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 The final sign off from Reliant legal.  I will prepare the executables and get them to Eva. 
 Stephen,  We will revise the termination date to be May 27, 2002. 
 Please review and let's discuss. 
 Last week was crazy.  Sorry about this.  I will send them out today. 
 I found this doc.  Hope it is the one you needed. 
 Eric,  See attached with my changes.  Robert, Can you provide the information Eric needs for Bridgeline.  Thanks. 
 Per our discussion, please review and provide comments asap. 
 Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 It was sitting on Haedicke's desk.  Eva, is going to pick it up and bring it to you for signature. 
 Attached is the latest version of the PA with my changes redlined.  Sorry for the delay. 
 FYI,  My Fla. counsel's comments to our letter. 
 Don't you have work to do today?  By the way, I will kick your ass for free! 
 Your leaving Friday? =20 
 Attached is the revised doc per our discussions. 
 Keith,  Please draft the letter and forward for my review.  Could you also forward the language for Item #1as you revised it?  Thanks. 
 Lisa, Your changes look fine to me.  I added the sentence to make it clear that ECS would not be owning and operating that portion of the equipment.  It wasn't clear to me from the section which indicate we will be arranging for the installation of the compressors. 
 Lisa,  I made significant revisions to this form.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Barry,  Attached are the drafts we discussed yesterday.  Please give me a call to discuss. 
 Attached is the confirm and GTC for the Wellhead purchase with Keep Whole language that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Dave,  I made a few slight changes to the agreement.  Nothing substantive, just to clarify and catch some typos.  I am OK with this form.  We need to make sure the Universal signs any schedules to this agreement which specify the operating parameters of the units.  Also, David Marshall will need to review the insurance section and address how we handle their self insurance issues. 
 Keith,  Please revise the document to reflect Item 1 below.  With respect to Item 2, our environmental group is reviewing Enron's use of the property.  No such uses should be found.  What specifically are they looking for with respect to this item.  Finally, any word on the title check with respect to item #3. 
 Ask them to print and sign two copies. 
 Mark and Dave,  Please print out two copies of each and execute all four.  The closing statements need to be printed on ENA Letterhead.  Sign all four and fax to Don Baldridge.  Put all four originals in the Fedex to me for initial.  I have asked Don to obtain execution of NBP's side and fax back to me.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the revised statement.  Please review.  I will have ENA execute as soon as I hear from NBP. 
 I responded to Frank about 20 minutes ago. 
  FYI 
 Frank,  Sandi Braband had approved those agreements.  I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.  I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.  Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.  Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.  Let me know if I can help. 
 Larry,  What is the status of this permit? 
 For your review.  Let's talk early Monday. 
 Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.  I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify. 
  Chris,  Attached is Shonnie's draft of the Closing Statement.  Note that she nets out the amount with the payment due under the amended Master Services Agreement.  Please review. 
 Harry,  We have been using Bill Bryant and the Katz Kutter law firm to represent ECS' interest in the territorial dispute between Gulf Power and WFEC.  I forwarded your email to him and asked for his input.  Attached is his input.  I think his suggestion about a meeting with all parties involved is a good one.  Let me know what you think. 
 Kyle,  Attached are the final versions of the Servitude Agreement and the Filing Form.  We made some changes to the form for consistency.  Please review.  Roger and Rakhi, Please verify the legal description provided by Enterprise.  I also have a plat which I will forward to you for review.  After everyone has reviewed and approved we should be ready to go. 
 Keith, My changes are redlined.  Please provide any comments. 
    Kyle,  Attached is the agreement with the two changes I discussed on my voice mail message.  Please review.  Do we have a property description and a plat? 
 Kay, Please see the attached. 
 Please review the attached. 
 Ken,  Please review the attached. 
 Trevor,  I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on Paul's letter of April 19.  I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way to revised the Schedules to the Agreement.  Please review the amendment and schedules.  I revised the schedules further to make the base line calculations clearer.  If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I prepare executables.  Let me know if you have any questions.    Note:  We will also need to have a declaration of HPL and Managing Partner of HCC to review and approve this amendment.  Kevin Howard can sign and I have already prepared this document. 
 Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined versions with the changes we discussed yesterday.  Please review the exhibits on both documents one last time. 
 Ken,  Attached is a revised draft of the Hanover Agreement based on all our discussions to date.  Please review.  I would prefer one more internal review prior to forwarding to Hanover.  Please note where information is still needed concerning the specific units for the schedule forms.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Greg,  I have never been to a tasting before.  Will there be some small foods to go along with the wine?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined versions incorporating the modified suggested Kennedy revisions we discussed.  Please review.  I will revised the Independant contracts later this afternoon.

 Here are some names. 
 I sent in the admission fees, so hope you still want to go. 
 Dan,  Attached are the latest independent docs with the Collection Facilities funding, construction, and fee structure.  I  am working on a form a construction agreement which will be attached as an Exhibit to the Field Services Agreement. 
 Dan,  Attached are the Field Services and Purchase Agreement with the changes we discussed.  As we further discussed, there will be a letter agreement between Independent and Neidigger (??) which gives independent the right to produce and market his gas in accordance with the terms of the attached agreements.  Do you have Niedigger real name and type of entity? 
 Please review and forward to IPC.  This will be required to commit Niedigger gas to our purchasing and field services agreements. 
 Fine by me. 
 Here it  is.  Please revise as necessary. 
 David,  Attached is a construction agreement draft for a $750,000 gathering system between Sapphire Bay.LLC (of which ECT, Jedi II, and Independent are members) and Independent as contractor.  Sappire Bay will own the gathering system.  Please give me a call to discuss. 
 Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review. 
 Ken, Attached is a redline that might make your review easier.  I didn't want to forward this one to Hanover.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a redline with the changes we discussed.  Please review and if it looks OK, please forward to Susan and Dave. 
 The latest and greatest including form of construction agreement. 
 Lillie,  You might try checking with Jack Simunek.  I am not sure there is any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue. Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.  Might also check with him.  Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting this into a contract is a relatively simple matter. 
 Any chance they could email electronic version of this Agreement? 
 Attached is LOI with our revisions redlined.  Please review and call either Mark or myself to discuss. 
 Here it is. 
 I will be attending. 
 Dan,  Attached are the lastest turns of Kennedy.  Let me know if you or Kennedy have questions. 
 Lisa,    It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.  It is hard for me also.  I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.   It is hard for me not to break down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me through those times.  I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, helps or hurts at this time.  But I am not going to let us give up on each other.  My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I don't have to think about all the pain.  We are both struggling to find a place to start.  I want to start by just letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we can put this behind us.  I am not sure how to get there right now either. However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), but still Lisa nonetheless.  I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, whatever happens in the near future.  I felt I just to had to write this email.  Gerald 
 Attached is the termination letter with my revision.  Both a clean and redlined version. 
 Brian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.  The letter assumes the letter agreement was executed.  There also appears to be an agency agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.  This is also terminated by the letter.  I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.  Please review and add any comments you have.  Thanks

 G,  How is it going?  Been a while since we spoke.  What have you been up to?  As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.  Nothing real exciting.  Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.  I don't think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon.  I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.  It won't be long now though for football.  Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good in practices so far.  That first game makes me nervous.  NC State is a pretty good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting.  Now for the real subject.  Tailgating.  How is it shaping up this year?  Same place, cold beer, good food.  I am definitely coming in for the NC State game.  Lisa may or may not be with me.  Don't know yet.  Anyway I will be glad to contribute to the cause.  Drop me a note when you get a chance and fill me in. 
 Dan,  Attached are the 1st drafts. 
 Dan,  Please disregard the prior draft and use this one. 
 GT,  The theme of the party sounds excellent.  What time is the party on Friday and where does the boat leave?  I may take a day of vacation.  I have more than I can probably use this year.  G$    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Dan,  Could you ask Denise if all the Lease Agreement are the same form.  If not, I need to see all of them. 
 Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield contract):  1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure. 2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month. 3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment (Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above) 4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.  Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above if not for the Force Majeure event.  Thus,  5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption. 6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour charge do the following:  Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times (Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.  Let me know if you have any questions.  We can work through an example if we need to.  Thanks. 
 I know love isn't enough by itself.  We have to give each other more.  The types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life.  We have focused on material things,  when really more meaningful things, such telling the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some facet of life are what fills each other.  We are both bright and ambituous people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life, but in the right context.  Not as direction, but as background to connecting as husband and wife.  Husband and wife means many things; friends, supporters, providers, sounding boards, lovers,  shoulder to cry on, someone to just hold onto, or walk hand in hand on the beach.  I want to do these things for you and want you to do them for me.   Hope you can think of me.  Love, Gerald 
 Denise,  Attached is the agreement with changes redlined.  Please review and call me if you have questions.  (713) 853-3512 
 Thought you might be interested.  Just in case you aren't recieving these emails. 
 Has the few changes we discussed. 
 Meant to copy you on this. 
 Please read the attached and respond. 
 Here it is. 
 David,  Please review the attached document, specifically Section 6.7. 
 Attached are the changes we discussed today. 
 Rude Dog,  Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the edge.  Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game. But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.  The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good one.  Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment.  G$ 
 I recieved both documents.  Thanks. 
 Attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new Collection Facilities Agreement.  The Collection Facilities Agreement has the insurance requirements but not the Security Documents.  I will forward the Security Doc. shortly. 
 Attached is the security document form.  Section 5.4 is missing and I will provide tommorrow.  However, in the interest of time I am forwarding the agreement for review. 
 GT,   I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.  I plan on driving in Friday night and probably getting there about 9:00 pm.  If its okay I'll crash at your place.  Let me know how your schedule looks.  Since Lisa isn't coming I'll have an extra ticket with me on the 35. Interested? 
 This version includes the Section 5.4 language. 
 Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.  I have the Powder River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review. Please note that I added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized at their current location.  This was resultant of the 5 year term for the units contracted for during the initial 2 year period. 
 Kay, Please review the attached data sheet and let me know if there are any problems.  Thanks. 
 Attached are the executable documents 
 Bob,  Please print out 2 copies and have Hanover execute.  Please fax signature today to me at (713) 646-3490 and FEDEX or Courier complete contracts to me at:  EB3883 1400 Smith Houston, Tx 77002  Thanks for your help. 
 G,  I will be there about 9 pm tonight.  My cell phone # is 281-772-9250 
 I am fedexing the form of lease this morning.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Oooouch!    That one hurt.  We really kicked their butt all over the field. The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks.  I don't think he had one completed on him all night.  What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team. I am trying not to get too down about this.  This is  a young team that is going to make mental errors and they will improve.  I still thinks we will have a good season.  The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding.  He looks fast out there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return.  He also got some snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding. Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles.  Victor Ike should be our starting tailback.  He look big and fas
