 Hi Mom,  Hope everything is going well.  Sorry to hear about the relatives. I am doing fine.  Staying busy with work.  I am scheduling a trip to China in June.  My friend Eric's has a brother who lives in China and is getting married to a Chinese national.  He invited me along, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to see a part of the world that I likely would not otherwise see.  We will be going from June 4 through June 16.  Flying into the city of Shanghai and from there going to a smaller town called Qingdao.  The wedding will take place in Qingdao.  Should be interesting to experience a Chinese wedding.  We will then go to Beijing for sightseeing.  Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, Great Wall etc.    Should be a great experience.  My roommate will be moving out in a couple of weeks and is getting married May 5 in Des Moines, Iowa.  I will going up for the wedding.  Take care and talk to you later.

 AP--  In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 playing recruiting "catch-up", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state wide out  Delmer Shanks  As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the "Opossum" set of OU's daunting new offense. "The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year", Shanks explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart. "In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up out with 2 or 3 of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, and then the center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand off to either me or the quarterback.". When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the season, a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to say. "Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be sponsoring OU athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I really liked what they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring they're putting on everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also gonna do some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon pies and stuff at the door." Shanks did not take any official visits to other schools before his commitment, though he did say Texas A&M and OU had expressed interest in him all along. "Yeah, they were plenty nice at A&M and Coach Slocum talked to momma a lot on the phone. He told her that this was gonna be the year they would pass more and that I would fit in real good with their high power pro-style attack". It turns out that Delmer's mother did influence his decision some. A laughing Shanks explains, "Yeah, we was out back pitching washers and momma come hollering outside...said Stoops promised her I would wear #8 at OU. We all been Dale Earnhardt Jr. fans for a long time, so we seen the importance of what they was saying. They don't honor you like that OU unless they done taken a real liking to you." As the interview came to a close, Shanks had this to say, "Keep an eye on us, cause we're gonna be pretty darn good next year. We got 11 man plays in the book where the whole line is gonna go out on pass routes and we keep the water boy in to block for the quarterback. Boomer Sooner." Only time will tell if schools like Texas, Nebraska and others can keep up with Stoops and his amazing program. 
 Tyrell,  Attached is the letter amendment revised to reflect payment of Payment Two on Jan. 4, 2002 as well.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Mark,  The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter agreement:  1.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.  The "Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures" only are the method by which this is effected.  This change needs to be removed.  2.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the 1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK. Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct terminology under the Purchase Agreement.  All we are doing here is effecting the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already agreed.  3.  The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be stricken.  The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create a firm purchase deal with this letter.  4.  1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from "that quantity of Gas..... to.......... (the "Released Gas"" should be removed.  The term Released Gas is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in this letter.   I am OK with ENA "hereby" agreeing to waive any and all rights it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas.  However,  the term rights ENA "may" have needs to be stricken.  ENA's position is that we have the right to recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.  If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with Phillips, I would be happy to do so. 
 Paul,  Attached are the Greeley Docs.  They include:  Master Firm Enfolio Confirmation to Enfolio Letter Agreement governing the Transport and Storage Arrangements  Please forward to the appropriate persons at Greeley.

 Chris,  Attached is a draft of the letter agreement between ENAP and ENA and Enron South America.  Please review and forward any comments you have. There is an existing Confid. Agreement with ENAP which runs through January 21, 2002.  The letter I have attached piggybacks off of this existing CA.  Does Enron South America have local counsel who can answer whether certain provisions in the Agreement, such as choice of Texas law, are valid under Chilean law?  We need to verify this or Texas law may not be binding.  Let me know if you want to discuss or have any questions. 
 FYI  Attached is the draft gas agreement I had forwarded to EES earlier.  I did not receive a response.

Samantha Ferguson, an HBA law clerk from last summer, will again support the Global Market group this summer.  I would like to have a point person from each of your groups with the charge of getting these clerks involved in the project flow for each group.  My plan is to have these clerks work with two groups during their time here with the groups rotating during the summer.  Please, consider who in your groups would be best suited for this role and provide feedback as soon as possible.  I will take this role for the East Origination-Gas Trading group.

 Revised per your request.  I did remove the conditions precedent.  All outs in the Cinergy Trading Firm Contract have expired.  I understand that Kern has a final certificate from FERC.  Is this the case?  We do need to have the executed assignment docs, before we sign this paper.

I will shout out at ya tommorrow.  The Artist

 Barry,  Attached are redlines of the docs with the changes we discussed today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Let me address your topics one by one:  1. That is fine, except that no guaranties regarding the condition of your entertainment center can be made for the duration of your stay.  What day are you planning on moving? 2.  I have only received one piece of mail within the last week, so I think it is mostly working. 3.  Eric's local  - Egillaspie@coral-energy.com  (713) 230-3576 4.  No calls 5.  Sounds good.  Sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up, we both have been running somewhere when we ran into each other at the house.  Sat. nite I think the Gillaspie's wanted to go to Sambuca's downtown.  Thought I might join them.  Might want to check with Eric to see what's up.  Peace,  G$      ryan.ruppert@exxonmobil.com 05/25/2001 07:51 AM 
 Wanted to make sure you had the latest docs.  I discussed with Barry and the MDDQ section was not changed since this version. 
 The importance of all long term plans to build a comfortable life faded away into cloud of apathy and listfulness.  No cares anymore.  Just extract as much as possible from each experience never knowing where it might take you. Wow.  Such thought before used to scare the hell out of you.  But isn't it ironic to finally find out no matter how much you try to control each aspect of your existence, it could end up somewhere completely unforeseeable anyway.  You have no control.  No control.  So why try to control it.  Why not open yourself up to all those unknowns, those risks, those potential great failures. 
 You didn't hit your face on the pavement at any point in the evening did you?  In case you didn't know, Barbara and I are going to China with Eric.  I will be leaving June 4 and returning June 16.  Any chance I could get you to drop buy every couple of days and pick up my newspaper and mail and put them inside?  Would appreciate it.  I pay her $50 per visit and she comes every two weeks.  Not a bad deal.  G$     ryan.ruppert@exxonmobil.com 05/29/2001 10:56 AM 
 Ken,  Attached is the Northwest Pipeline FA with my comments incorporated. I have attached both a clean and a redlined version.  Please note that I added a cap to the total facilities costs.  This is a recommendation.  To the extent we have no cap however,  Crescendo is at risk for all costs they incur.  Cost overruns could be significant.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Barry,  I added a some language to th disclaimer. 
 Barry, For your review.

 Please see the attached memo. 
 Per Barry's request, attached is the Agency and Management Services Agreement to be executed between Enron North America Corp. and Mexicana De Cobre.  Also attached is the form of agency agreement to be attached as Exhibit B to the Agency and Management Services Agreement.  This agency agreement is El Paso's form and must be executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El Paso.  The El Paso form requires that you open as a read only file. Please review.    We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.  We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.  Thank you for your cooperation.  Gerald Nemec Attorney ENA Legal

 Kim,  Attached are the revised documents for Palo Alto.  The documents are revised to reflect the deal term comments that the City forwarded.  I changed the name of the document to Natural Gas Services Agreement to address their concerns about a non commodity agreement.  I have also added language requiring a City Council resolution to for this document.  Instead of a legal opinion, we would require the City Attorney to approve both the Natural Gas Services and Transaction Agreements.  In included a redline of the services agreement from the prior version.  The Transaction Agreement would not redline on MS word for some reason.  I will request my assistant to redline it for you on Monday using comparewrite.  If you need help prior to my return, please coordinate with Jeff Hodge.  Please forward these documents to the City if you are okay with them.   Thanks. 
 Rae,  Please redline the No4 against the original No3 on compare write and forward via email to Kim Ward.  MS word would not redline correctly. 
 Shonnie,  Attached are my comments per our discussion. 
 Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:  Bay Gas Storage 1.  Draft CSA 2.  Draft Lease Agreement 3.  Draft O&M Agreement    Oakhill 1.  Draft CSA 2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.    Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS. If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks. 
 Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper. 
 GT,   Big game this week!  I heard ESPN Gameday is even going to be in Austin.  Sounds pretty cool.  OK if I crash at your place again?  I am planning on coming in early Saturday morning right now. 
 That sounds cool.  We talk more later. 
 EB3883.  See you tommorrow. 
 So in other words, a typical night in the Gillaspie household, except for the sex. 
 Attached is the agreement with my markups.  Both clean and redlined. 
 Attached is a clean and redline version of the revised agreement.  Dan has not had a chance to review all the new language, but in the interest of time, I am sending this out for review. 
 I know he's not actually planning to crack the seal on that book and to sponge off us, so I have been feeding him bad information all week.  I can't wait until Kristi asks, "What could happen if you don't properly equalize?" and he answers, "You could have painful flatulence for 6 months." 
 What time is the tailgate kicking off?  I am still driving in on Saturday morning.  Not sure if I have any 70s stuff, but I will take a look.  Need a tie dye. 
 I feel your pain brother.  I only about halfway through Section 1.   I haven't picked up the book in a while.  I will have to catch up on Sunday because I will be in Austin on Saturday watching the Horns crushed the angry red menace.  Is there a cliff notes version of this book?? 
 Attached are clean and redline versions of my revisions to the Confidentiality Agreement.  Please Note:  1.  I am not sure is the paragraph concerning US Technical Data is necessary.   If it is, what are we receiving and what type of obligations would we have?  2.  Need to get as specific as possible concerning the project in the first paragraph.  I will be in a due diligence this afternoon and most of tommorrow.  I will be checking voice mail. 
 http://www.ble.state.tx.us/current.htm 
 Yes, I did receive it.  I have been out of the office on a due diligence the last couple of days.  I will review and get back to you tommorrow.  Thanks. 
 Ted,  Attached is a revised draft of a letter.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  Please note the following with respect to this issue:  1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.  2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas richness).  3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we will reference Force Majeure.  4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with addresses. 
 Can you please pull the referenced contract and lets discuss. 
 Remember the line Clint gave when the bounty hunter wanted to take him back and he told Clint he we just trying to make a living.  Clint responded "Dying ain't much of a livin boy!"  Remember that.  That was awesome. 
 T minus 10 days? 
 Your welcome.  Maybe drinks and moonpies.  Sound good?  Maybe next week. We'll talk after the legal boondoggle. 
 I will be in the Woodlands til probably around 7:30, but could meet you guys at that time. Where and when?  The Mausoleum? 
 Please see attached.

 I enjoyed lunch today also.  It was nice to feel normal, even if only for a short time. 
 I am sending you some handwritten comments to this version.  I am going home the rest of the day.  If this is something that has to be sent out today, incorporate these comments in any new version.  Otherwise lets talk about it tommorrow. 
 GT,  I won't be able to come in for the game this weekend.  I am taking a scuba diving class and I have open water dives on both Saturday and Sunday. I am kinda pissed off at myself that I didn't realize this when I signed up for the class but now I am committed.  I will still sell the tickets to your brother and nephew if they want them though.  I can FEDEX the tickets to you by Friday or worst case, just have the ticket office leave passes for the seats at will call.  Let me know.  G, 
 I will FEDEX the tickets.   Party hard for me.  G,  You need to come to Houston when you get a chance and well have a good time. 
 GT,  Ticket went Fedex today, and should be there tommorrow after 10 am.  If not please let me know.  I will get tix to Big 12 game and join the party bus.  Is Stacy going? Sar! 
 Neta,   I understand you currently have an agreement in place with Jomax Construction.  Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C. wants to do an affiliate work order under the existing agreement.  Can you email the details on the agreement and forward a copy of the agreement.  I will use the form of Affiliate Work Order you forwarded prior.  Thanks for your help. 
 Ah yes!  A mini 2 year old cheese burger.  Why should that cause problems? 
 Mark,  The attached document outlines the relevant documents to be assigned to the new LLC and their assignment provisions.  Please note that for the City of Farmington Power Supply Agreement (Bloomfield), a deposit will be required by the new assignee.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Larry and Lance,  The contract packages which contain the referenced agreements will be sent today. 
 I again reviewed the storage contracts on which large value has been assessed.  The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners, L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated rates. The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge.  Since we are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive these rates in a competetive bidding situation.  It is my understanding the discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these discounts are at risk due to posting requirements.  The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign.  Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the same as above.  I am verifying the reposting requirements with Randy Rich of Bracewell & Patterson (FERC Counsel) and he is to get back with me early this afternoon. I will let you know if anything changes. 
 Dan,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of my changes.  As we discussed, the letter is now non-binding. 
 Tell her that I will buy her all the beer she wants if she goes to Cozumel with us.  Just two conditions.  Craig stays home and she rooms with me! 
 Dan,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the non-binding LOI.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 GT,   Was that an ass kicking or what?   The game look like a blast on TV.  I am still pissed I missed it.  Did you get the tickets okay?  Hope so.  How was the Tailgate?  Any sweet sweet babies?

 Jim,  Attached is a clean and redline version of your letter with my comments.  The deal maker on this one is probably the appropriate person to sign this one.  Is it Jim Ducote?  Is Greg Brazaitis or Steve Schneider aware of this project?

 A little Mihm action. 
 Mark,  Attached are redlines of the revisions to the O&M and CSA Docs. 
 Same stuff going on here.  Lisa and I are still settling things.  Looks like I am going to keep the house.  So you need to come into town and well have a good time.  My address is:    1403 Banks Houston, Texas 77006  I am hooked up with tickets to the Big 12 game.  Are you guys still planning on a bus to SA? 
 In the literate world (outside of Iowa) this is a "poll",  not "pole". 
 I was thinking about coming into Austin Friday night and driving up with you guys on Saturday and staying in Austin again Saturday night.  I am going to have a friend with me (male unfortunately) since I have two tickets.  Let me know if that fits in with your plans. 
 Three problems with this Draft.  1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to meet "all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver".  My concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.  2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in establishing such date.  3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication Equipment.  This was not in the first draft.  We need some assurance that this equipment will do the job we need it to.  I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their convenience. 
 Attached for review are the following: 1.  Bill of Sale for Bloomfield Electric Motor (ECT to ECS) 2.  Bill of Sale for Bisti Electric Motor (ECT to ECS) 3.  Assignment of Contracts for Bloomfield Station (ECT to ECC) 4.  Assignment of Contracts for Bisti Station (ECT to ECC)  Mark,  Please forward to the appropriate accountant since Roger is no longer on this deal.  Lance,  Please forward to A&K.  I do not have their email address. 
 Arnold,  Do you have a name and number of the Plains attorneys (or someone who has their number) so I can discuss the attached issues with them concering the Comm Agreement. 
 Attached is the final version of the mechanical maintenance agreement. 
 Attached is Greg's email with my response in bold inserted.  Based on my review notes.  Let me know if you need anything else.    Enron North America Corp. 
 GT, Do you have a ticket for the game set up.  The guy going to the game with me, is not 100% committed.  If you don't need it, he will use it.  I will be coming to Austin by myself though and he would meet me at the game.  Are you driving up to SA with anyone?

 Attached are drafts of the MidCon Interconnect Agreement for Deer Park and Greens Bayou.  The agreements are written with the following key points.  1.  HPL will install both meter facility to mutally agreeable specifications. 2.  HPL will own and operate the Greens Bayou Point. 3.  MidCon will own and operate the Deer Park Point. 4.

 Interesting read from Fortune Magazine.  A little dated though.   Copyright 1999 Time Inc. Fortune  December 20, 1999  SECTION: FEATURES/TEXAS LONGHORNS; Pg. 160  LENGTH: 4639 words  HEADLINE: How One College Program Runs The Business; INSIDE LONGHORN INC.  BYLINE: Roy S. Johnson, Research Associate Mary Danehy  BODY:   Tom Hicks was beside himself. He couldn't sit in one place. And he couldn't stand. He couldn't even bear to watch at times, but the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, the giant buyout firm, also couldn't afford to turn away, because this deal could go either way. I'm not talking about the company's pending $ 200 million bet on an Internet outfit called Teligent. That's pocket change to a business managing more than $ 11 billion in assets. This was really big. This was Saturday afternoons in the fall. This was perky cheerleaders flying through the air, and high-stepping marching bands. This was college football. This was Texas.  On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin, the University of Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few minutes on the clock at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the team's newly renovated home. A win would be huge. The Cornhuskers, perennial national title contenders, were big-bully conference rivals and ranked third in the nation, while the young Longhorns were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under second-year coach Mack Brown. Hicks is a proud and generous alum (Texas Exes, they're called), and he's deep into this Hook 'em Horns thing. Two years ago he flew athletic director DeLoss Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown to Austin personally, and he regularly counsels the coach on management matters. He also advised Dodds about pricing, financing, and amenities when Texas built 66 posh private suites at the stadium before last season. In October he hosted a charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous Texas-Oklahoma weekend to benefit the school's sports programs. He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas Stars, but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns.  So it's understandable that he was a bit on edge at the Nebraska game, hosting a couple of dozen friends, relatives, and business associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the field at the Nebraska game. Wearing a Longhorn burnt-orange shirt and surrounded by enough ice-cream bars and shrimp to satisfy an offensive line, Hicks was anxious and animated. "Hey," he yelled, "ain't this something?"  It sure is. The University of Texas athletic program is at a pretty intriguing place in college sports. With a surging young football team at its core, it is one of the most successful college athletic programs in the country, and I'm not just talking about wins and losses. This is a multimillion-dollar enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a renegade campus outfit. College sports has been a big-ticket dance for some time now, and this program is much like others at the top-tier universities, but there are a couple of exceptions: The folks making the moves in Austin function more like CEOs than like traditional athletic directors and coaches, and they're making it work.  To determine how they do it, I went back to school this fall and asked to take a close look at the books. What I found was an operation that balances the athletic department's educational responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the costs of running a big-time athletic program are surging and most college athletic programs are in the red. I found a place where football pays the bills. That was no surprise, but this was: Among the beneficiaries of big-time football is a women's sports program that could be a model for gender equity.  In fact, at the University of Texas, the football Longhorns are Grade A cash cows. Athletics officials credit the team with generating a staggering 80% of the department's $ 45.3 million from revenues in 1999. That's $ 36 million from tickets, individual donations, rights fees, sponsorships, hot dogs, beer, and other sources.  The athletic department operates much like a self-contained corporation, separate and apart from the rest of the university. It has its core business (football); various auxiliary operations (other men's and women's teams); numerous revenue streams; traditional corporate functions such as finance, marketing, public relations, and HR (you know it as recruiting); and even sophisticated satellite offices--dozens of alumni chapters nationwide, through which athletics targets some 400,000 Texas Exes for private gifts. Got shareholders? You bet. More than 80,000 of them meet in the stadium in Austin on Saturdays in the fall, and they grade every move Mack Brown makes. Think chasing quarterly expectations is brutal? Try putting the success of your company in the hands of a bunch of 18- to 22-year-olds. Hate talking to analysts? Try answering Buck from Muleshoe, Texas, on a weekly call-in talk show after losing a 23-point lead in the fourth quarter.  Of course, the whole thing is complicated by the fact that while a major-college athletic program must be managed with the diligence of a public company, athletic directors don't have the luxury of shutting down unprofitable businesses--at most schools that would be every sport save football and men's basketball. And those well-paid football coaches, quite simply, must win. "If we were a business, we wouldn't have any sport but football, and we would generate a heck of a profit," says Dodds, who is among the nation's most respected athletic directors. "But we're not about that. We take the money we generate from football and use it to provide opportunities for other kids. Then we try to balance what we want to accomplish inside the institution with what folks outside the institution want us to do. It's a hard thing to do."  For more than a quarter-century, one of the most difficult challenges for college sports has been finding a place for women. You've probably heard of Title IX, the historic clause in the Education Amendments Act of 1972 that turned college sports on its ear by requiring athletic programs to offer equality for women in participation, scholarship allocation, recruitment spending, and coaching resources. The requirement forced athletic departments to essentially double their operations, which helped spark the overall growth in college sports. So whatever you think about the emphasis on college football, hey, it pays for women's soccer, okay?  The Texas athletic department's budget is among the largest in the nation--$ 41.2 million for fiscal 1999, which ended in August. Only four universities had fatter sports wallets that year: Wisconsin ($ 41.4 million), Tennessee ($ 45 million), Michigan ($ 47.6 million), and Ohio State, No. 1 by far with a whopping $ 64.9 million athletics budget. (If you think those who spend the most win, forget it: OSU is the only school of the group not ranked in the latest Top 25 AP football poll.)  How does UT get to its number? For starters, ticket sales and game guarantees (payments to UT by a host school when the Longhorns play on the road) generated $ 10.1 million in revenue last year. That category was exceeded only by private gifts, which totaled an impressive $ 21 million. Other significant income categories included suite-lease revenue ($ 3.2 million), television money ($ 3.9 million), payment for the team's Cotton Bowl appearance ($ 866,842), optional student fees ($ 570,000), sponsorships and advertising ($ 400,000), licensing revenue ($ 300,000), and concessions ($ 750,000). All told, the department generated $ 45.4 million in 1999.  The athletic department's expenses totaled $ 50.1 million. That included scholarships valued at $ 2.8 million for 226 men and 186 women, administrative costs ($ 1.4 million) for about 230 employees, and equipment purchases ($ 2.4 million). The costs of running individual teams ranged from $ 7.5 million for football to $ 370,000 for tennis.  What caused the shortfall? The final bills for a two-year, $ 93 million capital improvement effort. Remarkably, the athletic department completed the project without a penny from the university's academic funds. It raised more than $ 31 million in private donations in just over two years. The department also took out $ 48 million in bonds (serviced now by lease and ticket revenues). The bill was closed with $ 14 million from the university's Parking and Traffic division to fund a parking garage. So what can you get for $ 93 million? Take a stroll down East Campus Drive near the stadium, and you'll pass the spiffy new $ 28 million Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field. One block over is maybe the nicest football practice facility in the country, the newly renovated Denius Athletic Fields ($ 2.5 million). It was subsidized by 82-year-old World War II veteran Frank A. Denius, a longtime fan who has attended practices most every day for as long as anyone can remember.  Beyond the 66 suites at Royal-Memorial stadium, UT added nearly 7,000 new seats, renovated major sections on both sides of the 76-year-old facility, and lowered the field three feet. Why lower the fi
