h him.  I need the following information:  Full Name Address Pay rate (Hourly/Daily+Expenses?)  I think that's all for now.  Thanks. 
 Susan,  Attached is the letter with slight revisions I mentioned on your phone mail.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is my changes redlined against your latest version. 
 Mark,  I joined the foundation today and should be in the system.  Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Thanks for your help. Gerald Nemec 
 Movie sounds pretty cool.  When is the official release date?      Eric Gillaspie 05/15/2000 01:40 PM 
 Pat,  Could you please print the attached docs for me and also save them in my directory under the Generation Barges folder.  Thanks. 
 I will get something to you within the next couple of days.  Should be a straightforward letter agreement.  Eric,  Let's discuss in the morning.      Candace L Bywaters 05/16/2000 08:41 AM 
 Big 12 leads recruiting charge ?      ?	By Bill Hodge FANSonly.com  Dominating the 1999-2000 college basketball recruiting season, the Big 12 has five teams in the top 15 men's classes following the late signing period.      Search for signings  The spring signing period ran from April 12 to May 15. Use FANSonly.com's databases to find all the signings for your favorite school. Men's database search Women's database search.  Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas, Missouri and Iowa State all had outstanding recruiting campaigns. Overall results are pending as signed scholarships continue to arrive following the final signing day on May 15. Financial aid agreements (binding schools, but not athletes) may still be signed. Eligibility problems are common and will affect final rankings as well. Iowa, Indiana and Michigan State head up the top of the Big Ten, while Connecticut, Seton Hall and St. John's collected impressive classes in the Big East. North Carolina headed the ACC and Cincinnati topped Conference-USA, while Memphis, under new head coach John Calipari, finished strong. Alabama leads the SEC. If you're looking for pure size, 7-foot-6 center Neil Fingleton, a native of England who attended Worchester-Holy Name Central Catholic, Mass., signed with North Carolina. Curtis Johnson, a 7-4 center from Norfolk-Ryan Academy, Va., is set for St. John's. However, neither will play early roles. 1. Connecticut F Caron Butler,6-7, Pittsfield-Maine Central Institute, Maine G Taliek Brown, 6-1, Astoria-St. John's Prep, N.Y. F Scott Hazelton, 6-8, Lawrence-Central Catholic, Mass. F Johnnie Selvie, 6-7, Flint, Mich/Southeastern CC, Iowa G Robert Swain, 6-4, College Park-Tri-Cities, Ga. The Huskies have an outstanding class, adding a top junior college player in Selvie, plus Swain during the spring. Coach Jim Calhoun had to worry about signing Butler, the top prep school prospect in the nation, at the last minute over UNLV. Brown and Hazelton are both McDonald's All-Americans and potential stars, but all attempts by the UConn staff of signing a big man failed. Brown is physical and a scorer. Hazleton is a smooth wing player. 2. Seton Hall F Eddie Griffin, 6-8, Philadelphia-Roman Catholic, Pa. G Andre Barrett, 5-8, Manhattan-Rice, N.Y. G Marcus Toney-El, 6-6, West Orange-Seton Hall Prep, N.J. F Damion Fray, 6-8, Huntington Station-Whitman, N.Y. Coach Tommy Amaker has this program on the way up and added three Top 50 players in Griffin (considered by many as the top prospect in nation), Barrett and Toney-El. All three should step into the starting lineup or find extensive playing time off the bench. 3. Oklahoma F James Wright, 6-6, Winchendon School, Mass. F Johnnie Gilbert, 6-7, Minneapolis-Patrick Henry, Minn. F Aaron McGhee, 6-8, Vincenness JC, Ind. F Daryan Selvy, 6-6, Carl Albert JC, Okla. C Ronnie Griffin, 6-9, Tallahassee CC, Fla. G Blake Johnston, 6-1, Midland, Texas F Joszef Szendrei, 6-9, Northeastern JC, Colo. Coach Kelvin Sampson landed athletes who can run and rebound with power. McGhee and Selvy are first-team junior college All-American forwards and both Griffin and Szendrei are very strong inside. Wright and Gilbert were highly rated preps. 4. Oklahoma State F David Anderson, 6-8, Hargrave Military Academy, Va. G/F Terrence Crawford, 6-6, Oklahoma City-Bishop McGuinness, Okla. G Ellis Kidd, 6-5, Dallas-Madison, Texas C Jack Marlow, 6-11, Tulsa-Union, Okla. F Ivan McFarlin, 6-7, Sugar Land-Willowridge, Texas G Maurice Baker, 6-1, Dixie JC, Utah G Melvin Sanders, 6-5, Seward CC, Kan. Coach Eddie Sutton is very high on Sanders, McFarlin and Crawford. Marlow weighs 285 pounds. Kidd can light it up and Anderson is very quick for 6-8. Baker and Sanders were Spring additions and can score. 5. Iowa C Jared Reiner, 6-11, Tripp-Delmont, S.D. F Glen Worley, 6-8, Iowa City-West, Iowa G Brody Boyd, 5-10, Dugger-Union, Ind. F Courtney Scott, 6-6, Lansing-Waverly, Mich. F Sean Sonderleiter, 6-9, Des Moines-Christian, Iowa F Reggie Evans, 6-8, Pensacola-Woodham, Fla/Coffeyville CC, Kan. Guard Luke Recker and guard Ryan Hogan, both redshirt transfers, also join the Hawkeyes. This is one of the top Hawkeye classes ever, as coach Steve Alford signed a highly rated center in Reiner (who passed on UConn and Kansas), a top forward in Worley and an unbelievable shooter in Boyd. Evans is considered a top junior college prospect at power forward and Hogan played at Kentucky before transferring. The huge prize is Recker, who transferred to Arizona from Indiana and then moved to Iowa in order to be nearer his family and girlfriend, who was seriously injured in a car accident. After an appeal, the NCAA allowed eligibility this fall. Recker averaged 16 points as a sophomore for the Hoosiers and was third-team all-Big Ten. The Hawkeyes already have a junior committment from one of the top guards in the nation, Pierre Pierce of Westmont, Ill. 6. St. John's G Omar Cook, 6-1, Middle Village-Christ the King, N.Y. F Kyle Cuffe, 6-8, Manhattan-Rice, N.Y. C Mohammed Diakite, 6-11, Rockville-Montrose Christian Academy, Md. G Willie Shaw, 6-6, Bronx-Stevenson, N.Y. C Curtis Johnson, 7-4, Norfolk-Ryan Academy, Va. Forward Alpha Bangura and center Abe Keita are coming off redshirt years, which makes coach Mike Jarvis' list of fresh faces even bigger. Jarvis had corralled a super class, perhaps best in the nation, but the key was F Darius Miles, 6-9, East St. Louis, Ill. A do-everything player generally rated among the top three prospects in the country, Miles turned to the NBA rather than attend St. John's. Without him, this group tumbles a few notches from their No. 1 ranking after the early signing period. Cook is dynamic and Diakite could the Red Storm's best center in years. Both have great basketball bodies and athleticism. Johnson was a late addition and is considered a project. F Eric King, 6-7, Brooklyn-Lincoln, NY., had entrance problems. 7. Cincinnati F Jamaal Davis, 6-8, Purdue/Barton County CC, Kan. F Rod Flowers, 6-8, Huntsville, Ala. G Field Williams, 6-3, Houston-Waltrip, Texas F Antwan Jones, 6-8, Tallahassee CC, Fla. G Immanuel McElroy, 6-4, Tyler JC, Tex. Reloading, the Bearcats have a great class with junior college standouts Jones, McElroy and Davis. Davis played at Purdue before transferring. Flowers and Williams are promising. National-quality guard/forward Jerome Harper of Columbia, S.C., had his letter withdrawn due to off-court/entrance problems and will attend junior college. 8. Texas G/F Brandon Mouton, 6-5, Lafayette-St. Thomas More, La. C/F Brian Boddicker, 6-9, Duncanville, Texas C Jason Klotz, 6-11, Houston-Klein Forest, Texas F James Thomas, 6-8, Hargrave Military Academy, Va. G Fredie Williams, 6-2, Mississippi Delta CC, Miss. G Royal Ivey, 6-3, Blairstown, N.J. This group, powered by big men wanting to play for coach Rick Barnes, is one of the nation's best. Thomas is tough and Boddicker was rated the best propect in the state. Both should get playing time with the departure of center Chris Mihm to the NBA. Purdue wanted Mouton badly, as he is a major offensive threat. Other keys are Ivey, Williams and Klotz. 9. Indiana F Jared Jeffries, 6-10, Bloomington-North, Ind. F/G A.J. Moye, 6-5, Atlanta-Westlake, Ga. G Andre Owens, 6-3, Indianapolis-Meridian, Ind. F Mike Roberts, 6-8, New Hampton-Prep, N.H. Coach Bob Knight and the Hoosiers shocked Duke by signing Jeffries, one of the best forwards in the nation, and all four prospects are top quality. Moye is a physical player and suited for the Big Ten wars, and Owens and Roberts are very tough. Jeffries, a huge believer in Knight, threatened to transfer if the veteran coach had been fired. 10. Michigan State G Marcus Taylor, 6-3, Lansing-Waverly, Mich. F Zach Randolph, 6-8, Marion, Ind. Spartan followers can't complain about a class with the top guard and center/forward in the nation. Higher-rated schools just had more prospects. Taylor is outstanding and should see time early. Randolph, still not qualified, is a widebody who dominated prep all-star play and could be the Spartans' best post player in recent years. 
 Please see the attached.  I am still trying to obtain the DOE reports for Canada from Juanita Marchand for Question #19 of the Pan Alberta.  Any help you could give me there would be greatly appreciated. 
 Brian,  Do you know how quick D&B would have data entered into this system? We need to move this as fast as possible.

 Chris,  My comments are as follows:  1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end of the current definitive term?  2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process. Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been accomplished.  3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of "day".  Does this day match the gas day for the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling.  4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?      Chris Meyer 05/19/2000 12:49 PM 
 Ken,  Attached is the form of services agreement for Ted Huss.  In the interest of time, you can print out two executables for Ted's signature and then return to me for initialling for Brian's signature.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Let's talk about this one also when you get a chance. 
 Attached is the revised Schedule I to the Bisti Compression Services Agreement Amendment.  Please replace the existing Exhibit with this one.  If you have any questions, please call me at x-33512.  Thanks for your all help in getting these done timely. 
 GT,  How is it going brother?  Got that house finished yet?    Wanted to see if you were going to be in town for the Memorial Day weekend.  I was kicking around the idea of doing some tubing and maybe stopping by Austion for a night to chase some good looking Austin women.  Drop me a line. 
 Could you get with Candy on this and provide her what she needs.  Let me know if you need any help.  Thanks. 
 Mary,  Here is another one from Candy.  Might want to check with AEW to make sure she hasn't taken care of this already.  Thanks for your help. 
 I am trying to compare the CA1 doc with the CA doc.   Thanks for your help. 
 GT,  Congratulations on the engagement!  Hate to see a good man go down, but it happens to the best of us.  Sounds like things are going really well for you.  When is the wedding?  Sounds like there are a lot of wedding bells in the Townsend family these days.  With respect to the weekend; change of plans.  I will be staying in Houston this weekend.  However, the following weekend myself and the red-faced Eric and possibly his wife want to come to Austin to hang out.  Are you around that weekend and could you handle 3 people crashing at your place.  If its a problem let me know.    "Townsend, George" <gtownsend@manorisd.net> 05/24/2000 02:03 PM 
 Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating the changes we discussed.  I have not changed either the liquidated damages or force majeure provisions at this point.  Ron, you indicated in your voice mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect to those provisions.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the uncertainty on the two provisions.  What are your thoughts?  Thanks 
 Heidi,  I have reviewed the contracts and the amendments and the following is their status:  1.  Contract Number 96006959 (012-41991-02-004)  Amended April 1, 1999  Term:  Month to Month and may be terminated by either party with 10 days written notice prior to end of the month (But see rate section below)  Rate:  Agreement was amended on April 1, 1999 to put a flat rate of $0.085 for all receipts at Thompsonville (Meter #6351) through March 31,   2006 (This language would override the month to month term)  No other Points of Receipt are allowed under this contract.  Note:  Prior to the Amendment on April 1, 1999, the $0.01 fee escalator was still in effect for any volumes moved under this contract prior to the Amendment.  If the escalator wasn't assessed during that time, it should have been.  This escalator would have applied to all receipts and    fees on the original Exhibit A to the contract.  2.  Contract Number 96006966 (012-41991-02-003)  Amended April 1, 1999  Term:  In effect through March 31, 2006  Rate:  Those set forth on Exhibit A as amended on April1, 1999 for the terms set forth on Exhibit A.  Let me know if you have any questions concerning the above summary. 
 Brad,  Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the Lease Docs for the MEGS Facilities? I forward those documents about a month back.  Gerald Nemec Enron North America Corp. - Legal 
 Greg,  Have you had a chance to review this document yet?  Any comments? 
 Bruce,  The legal description for my house is as follows:  Lot 27 Ranch Estates, an addition in Harris County, Texas according to the map or plat thereof recorded in Volume 22, Page 68 of the Map Records of Harris County, Texas.  Thanks 
 Our risk manager has reviewed the insurance requirements.  His only comment concerned the Owner's/Contractor's Protective Liability Insurace requirement on the bottom of the first page of Exhibit E.  He thinks this is unnecessary as we have adequate coverage under the General Liability and Excess Umbrella Liability.  Since this cost is likely to be passed on to us, we should waive this insurance requirement.  Everything else is OK from our perspective.  Let me know if you need any further information or have any questions. 
 Here is the link to the Enchantment Resort.  http://www.arizonaguide.com/enchantment/ 
 Rude-Dog,  How is it going out there brother?  Been keeping your sanity while living at home?  Things here are about the same.  Talked to your boy Tree the other day.  He had some interesting new developments in his love life.  Of course they were sordid and made me somewhat uncomfortable.  Well sort of. Your furniture is still almost completely intact.  The longer you stay out there, the better my chances of picking up some furniture real cheap.  Haven't seen that much of Janel lately.  She went out to Florida this weekend to convince a gay guy that the opposite sex is not icky after all.   Should make for some interesting stories when she returns.   Drop me a note when you get a chance.  Talk at you later.  G$ 
 Check out the attached response from Marathon concerning our revisions.  I guess this is a new negotiation technique.  Just ignore the counterparty's concerns.  Let's discuss this before I call Brad back.  Thanks. 
 Richard,  The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an Associate here at Enron.  I had worked with the Associate before but don't know his friend.  I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring needs, but that I would pass the resume along.  Barbara indicated you were our recruiting coordinator.  So here it is. 
 Lori,  Thanks for the diskettes.  The one disk did have the final version of the Agreements.  The other disk had earlier versions of the docs.   I will use the final versions to develop the amended and restated agreements. Should have drafts for BR's review later this week.  Do you want these diskettes returned?  I talked to Shonnie about any amendments to the LLC and Capacity Allocation Agreements, and she wasn't aware of any.  I don't think those 2 agreements were revised unless you have other information.  Let me know.  Thanks, Gerald     "Lori Marlatt" <lmarlatt@br-inc.com> 05/22/2000 02:32 PM Please respond to lmarlatt 
 Lauri,  Per my voicemail, the attached docs outline the elements for comparable shippers in the RailRoad Commissions eyes. 
 Richard,  I wouldn't worry about a letter.  It was a very informal submittal.  I will let my Associate friend know.  Thanks.    Richard B Sanders 05/31/2000 05:42 AM 
 I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our modification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for the modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.  MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications were simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner's transfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which Marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.  The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For these reasons, I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such a transfer to MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the Production Handling Agreement.  Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becoming jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS does not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.  Mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.  I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions at your convenience or to discuss the above further.      "Bradley G Penn" <bgpenn@marathonoil.com> 05/26/2000 10:00 AM 
 I had actually called you before I had seen this email.  I wasn't involved in the NOx emissions deal.  I don't think legal was involved at all, at least from a Compression Services perspective.  Mark Courtney was the deal maker for Compression Services and I believe that John Scarborough, an analyst was also involved.  Let me know if you can do lunch tommorrow and I can tell you exactly how exciting my weekend was.  See ya.     Janel Guerrero@ENRON 05/31/2000 10:21 AM 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Allocation and Expansion Determination Agreement.  I will follow with the LLC and Administrative Manager Agreement, however those changes will  be minor.  The substance is in this Agreement. 
 GT,  Looks like I will be hitting town on Saturday morning.  Eric and his wife will be with me.   We will come by your house in the morning, probably around 10 am or so to group up.  Let me know if everything is still a go for you this weekend.  I will probably need directions to your house again.  I don't remember how to get there from the last time.  G    "Townsend, George" <gtownsend@manorisd.net> 05/25/2000 12:09 PM 
 Please review. 
 Do you have any type of pro forma agreement that she refers to? 
 Attached is Marathon's response to our email.  I will call Brad to set up a telephone conference.  Ted,  Steve asked that I forward this information to a lawyer at Burlington, but couldn't recall the name.  Do you have any contact information for Burlington.  Thanks. 
 Candy,  We are working on a draft and should have something for you early next week.  Sorry for the delay.      Candace L Bywaters 05/31/2000 05:38 PM 
 GT,  Yea, he realized that as soon as we got to San Marcos.  Can you mail it Next Day Air also called Priority Mail?  I will pay you back next time I am in town.  His address is:  Eric Gillaspie 1007 Bay Oaks Houston, TX 77008      "Townsend, George" <gtownsend@manorisd.net> 06/05/2000 08:59 AM 
 Please see attached.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the draft CA for Intergen.  Note that there are still several blanks in the Agreement that I need information to complete.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Greg,  Attached is correspondence between Marathon and Enron (MEGS) concerning the revised draft of the lease that I had forwarded for Marathon's review and also to you for Mariner's review.  I wanted to give you the benefit of these discussion we have had with Marathon concerning how the MEGS and Mariner's responsibilities should be split.  Our intent with these revisions, and the our goals as we continue to work with Marathon on these issues is to simply allocate the risks between Mariner and MEGS with respect to Marathon, as Mariner and MEGS intended them to be allocated under the O&M Agreement between the two.  We are not asking Marathon to rely on the O&M Agreement to which they are not a party.  Risk associated with ownership of the flowline should run to MEGS and risk associated with the operation and maintenance of the flowline and ownership of the hydrocarbons should run to Mariner as they currently do under the Production Handling Agreement.  We intend to work with Marathon toward this end.  If you have any comments concerning these discussions or would like to discuss this further with me, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.  I would also be interested in any comments you may have with respect to the draft lease agreement I forwarded to you earlier.  Thanks.  Gerald Nemec ENA-Legal 
 GT,  Thanks for taking care of the ring and thanks again for the hosptality.  I will be back in not too long.  See Ya  G$ 
 How is it going?  Did you have a fun weekend?  My weekend was, although enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).  We arrived at Maggie Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had cancelled.  Great.  Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.  Cool. Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.  I had to have the car towed back into downtown.  Anyway, it was an interesting trip. 
 Kay,  Please see attached.  Thanks 
 Staci,  Attached is the amendment.  Please forward your revisions for my review.  Thanks. 
 Got my car back.  $700 to fix.  Ouch!  I am really just glad it wasn't worse.  When I stopped my car it was really smoking and I was afraid I had burned my moter up.  Eric was providing my transportation during the absence of the car.  What a great guy.  Yes, we should try to hook up this weekend. The only thing I have going right now is a party that one of the attorneys in my group is throwing Saturday night.  Hopefully I will be able to get out of there fairly early.  Let's talk before the weekend to try and work something out.   I am interested in discussing the Anne situation with you also.  Talk to you later.      Janel Guerrero@ENRON 06/06/2000 05:34 PM 
 Here it is guys.  Still checking for any cleanups, but in interest of time I am forward for your review.  It is redlined against the previous revised version. 
 Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the revisions.  Some revisions beyond  those we discussed with BR were made strictly to clear up inconsistencies in the original document.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  I plan on being at the Member Meeting in Denver next week, but please call any time prior if you wish to discuss.  (713) 853-3512. I will be forwarding the LLC and Administrative Agreement with revisions tomorrow.  The revisions to these docs are slight and only made to reflect the be consistent with the substantive changes in the Capacity Allocation and Expansion Determination Agreement. 
 I should have a draft for you by Friday.     Candace L Bywaters 06/07/2000 06:39 AM 
 I won't be able to make it.  I will be in Denver getting back late that evening.     Xochitl-Alexis Velasco 06/07/2000 12:33 PM 
 Carolyn,  Can you send me a copy of this document for our files.  Thanks.    Steve HPL Schneider 06/07/2000 05:42 PM 
 Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 FYI  Attached are the FERC materials we discussed earlier concerning third party ownership of compression in interstate pipes.  I will continue to research and see what might work. 
 Attached are redlined versions of an amended and restated LLC agreement and an amendment to the Administrative Services Agreement.  I decided to simply amend the Admin. Agreement since the change was so minor.  You will note that the changes in the LLC Agreement were solely to accommodate the revisions made in the Capacity Allocation Agreement which I forwarded earlier.  Please call if you have any questions. 
 Mark,  Attached are the confirms for both the ECS purchase and the ECT purchase.  Please take one last look.  If OK I will forward the ECS purchase to Porter and Hedges.    The ECT confirms still have the TW West Texas Pool as being the point at which ECT takes title. 
 Cris,  Attached are redline versions of revisions to the Lost Creek Capacity Allocation and Expansion Agreement which we had discussed some time back. The changes were made to accommodate several goals, but the one that you should have any concern with are in Section 2.3 and the definition of Third Party Gathering Agreement. 
 Rob,  Attached are redlined versions of the Lost Creek Docs displaying the revisions we had discussed some time back.  Please review and let me know of any issues you see with respect to the financing. 
 I am doing fine.  Work is fairly busy.  I went to Austin last weekend to see George.  He is engaged now and I think he will get married March of next year.  Met his fiance and she is really nice.  I received Jacob's B-day invitation in the mail this week.  Please let Janice know that I am sorry but won't be able to come down for the Party.  I will be coming down for the family reunion on July 1.  I will see the kids then.  I guess Sharon and Will are planning on coming down for the reunion also.  I will probably be there late Friday night.  Take care and talk to you later      Edward Nemec <ednemec@earthlink.net> 06/10/2000 04:08 PM

 Ned.  Attached is the CA with some comments incorporated.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the NNG Termination Agreement, clean revised CSA Agreement, and redlined revised CSA Agreement.  Please review. 
 Jaime,  This CA accidentally was sent to you with choice of law being New York.  It should be Texas law.  If Questar has seen this doc., we need to let them know.  Thanks. 
 Attached is a redlined revised agreement based on my discussions with Hoekenga Thursday.   James, We still need to talk about our Commercial Management activities in the Madden Field area and how those should be limited.  That change would be effected in the LLC Agreement. 
 I talked to Susan last Friday and she gave me her changes which I put into the doc.  So I am only waiting on Foti and Dushinske's changes.  Attached is the Vector term sheet.        Jamie Ginsberg@ENRON 06/19/2000 09:08 AM 
 Paula would be fine for me. 
 This is redlined against the original. 
 Staci, I am fine with the attached version.  I am checking with Mark to make sure he doesn't have any issues.  Thanks.      Staci Holtzman@ENRON 06/19/2000 10:30 AM 
 Attached are the latest revised redlined documents for Lost Creek.   Please note the following:  1.  The changes include those that Chris and I discussed in Denver.  The Capacity Allocation Agreement is redlined against the version BR had reviewed earlier.  All other docs. are redlined against the originals.  2.  Due to the Credit Agreement structure, portions of the Natural Gas Fuel Liquidation concept were placed into the Administrative Services Agreement. This was done in order to allow that portion of the Natural Gas Fuel value which covers the Power Bill to be included in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio calcs in the Credit Agreement.  The remainder of the Natural Gas Fuel will be distributed under the Capacity Allocation Agreement to avoid the inclusive of these excess amounts in any distribution tests under the Credit Agreement.  3.  Since more significant changes were made to the Admin. Services Agreement, it is now being amended and restated.  Dean,  have you resolved the accounting questions you raised this past Monday? 
 Ned,  Looks fine.  Let me know when you get the originals and I will initial.     Ned Higgins 06/22/2000 11:05 AM 
 Attached are the final versions of the Gallup and Kachina CSAs.  Note that both Bloomfield and Bisti have amendments   Gallup CSA and Gas Conversion Agreement and Gas Conversion Agreement Amendment     Bisti CSA and Amendment      Bloomfield CSA and Amendment

 Attached are redlines.  Please review.   Susan will be out of the office on Mon. and Tues. of next week, so we need to get this to her asap. 
 I am going to a farewell party for Mike Vigeant tonight.  He is leaving Enron.   Did you know Mike?  He worked in various groups and is currently in EBS.   I am open for Sat. and Sun.  Maybe we could hook up Sat.  I will give you a call on Saturday.  See ya.     Janel Guerrero@ENRON 06/23/2000 01:27 PM 
 Attached are redlines of the revised docs.  They are redlined against the versions NNG reviewed earlier. 
 Hello Miss Cynthia,  I am doing fine.  Work has been really kicking my butt lately.   Lunch Tuesday works for me.  I will give you a call on Monday to confirm.  Hope everything is going well with you also.  Take care.      "Cynthia San Marco" <csanmarco@kkrw.com> 06/23/2000 09:11 AM 
 Ken Pearson,  Attached is revised facilities agreement reflecting a small change in the design of the station.  Please review and let Cheryl Marshall know if it is acceptable asap.   We will replace that page in the originals and execute and forward one to Celanese.  The revised section are underlined and highlighted.  Cheryl will also be faxing revised exhibits to the agreement for your review. 
 Chris,  The firm schedules referred to are those currently in place on the Firm Gathering Agreement.  The latest amendments were dated September 24, 1999.  I only have hard copies, but can fax them to you.  Lori should have a copy of the amendments.   Also attached is the Capacity Allocation and Expansion Agreement most current changes redlined against the original.

 Shonnie,  I believe Brian left you a voicemail about this. Here is the latest from Hanover.  These guys are trying to renegotiate this deal.  Lets talk about this after you have had a chance to review. 
 Bob,  Attached is the scope of work.  I gave you the hard copy earlier. 
 Attached are the form of confirm that are being executed for the Gallup Amendments.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I have also attached the TW gas letter agreement which I had forward earlier.  These are all the operational docs. required for the amendment. 
 For completeness,  Attached are the operational documents that reflect the Gallup Amendments.  The Gas Price Letter reflects TW's agreement to provide incremental gas volumes.  The confirms to the existing Enfolio deals reflect the value for the gas which flows from Enron North America Corp. to Enron Compression Services Corp. and finally to the LLC.    The confirms done with the original Gallup Transaction are not being amended.  New confirms are being added to handle the incremental gas from TW.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Bob,  Attached is the form of Agreement we need to use for ForeRunner.  It is the same form we used for High Mountain.  We need to make sure it reflects design and engineering services provided.  We will also need a Tasking Letter.  Ken Choyce should be able to provide a contract at ForeRunner as well as scope of work.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Attached are the redlined revised docs and a new letter agreement for the payment of the $2 mil. 
 Dan,  I have reviewed the Wildhorse (Mesa) Gathering, Processing, and Transport Agreement.  This agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated to this Agreement through 2013.  The agreement present some problematic issues which I will outline.  1. Gas Quality -  The gas quality provisions only require Wildhorse to transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers (in this case Northwest Pipeline) gas quality specifications.  We propose to put in a treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications, however there are no provision in this Agreement which allow us to insert a plant between Northwest Pipeline and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse could delay are extract value from us for this connection.  This is an uncertainty.  2.  Wildhorse Obligation to Perform - Based on my understanding of the facts, at some point during the term of this agreement, Northwest Pipeline enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the downstream side of Wildhorse's Gathering System. As a result, Wildhorse shut in Enogex's production and it has been shut in ever since.  Wildhorse has a right to do this under this Agreement (see #1 above) and therefore Wildhorse has not breached its obligation to transport under this Agreement. Wildhorse's obligation was suspended when Northwest refused receipt of the gas.  3.  Unprofitability - Assuming Wildhorse worked with us to install the treating plant which conformed the gas to Northwest Specifications, they could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was still uneconomical for them to do so.  If they decided it is uneconomical for them to do so, they have the right to provide Enogex with various potential solutions which include (i) renegotiating the terms (ii) allowing Enogex to operate Wildhorse's equipment at Enogex sole cost, expense and risk, or (iii) release the gas from the Agreement.  The problem here is that there is no time limit under which Wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no specific solution they must reach.   Wildhorse could drag this out for some extended period of time and they could extract significant value.   My  recommendation is that we make Enogex's resolution of these issues with Wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal. I know the timing is late.  However if Enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of negotiating with Wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the gas,  everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take substantial time and Wildhorse will have significant leverage.  Let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions. 
 Have a great trip and try not to hook up with too many Italian hotties!  Must come back with lots of pictures and potentially a few life changing experiences. 
 Attached are executables for the Hubbard Transaction. 
 Mark,  Please review the attached letter and provide the missing date.  If everything looks good, I will prepare an original for your signature.  Also,  do you have any resolution on the TW transport issue?  Is it acceptable for ECT to take title at the West Texas Pool and ECS still operate the transport agreement as its agent? 
 Heidi,  Attached is the modified confirm form.  Please note the following:  1.  This will only work with an Interruptible all points master contract 2.  This confirm cannot extend the term of a transport agreement.  We need to make sure that the master is still in its term. 3.  The counter -party should sign off for every transaction.  Via fax signature is acceptable. 4.  A single form per contract must be used. 5.  This form is set up for 1 month or less deals.  We need to make sure this confirm can be handle under the existing global contract # for the master contract.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Fyi,  Attached is Marathon's Response. 
 Check's in the mail.  Sorry for the delay, I will review today.      Chris Sonneborn 06/30/2000 09:50 AM 
 Chris attached is a clean and redline version of the Gregg Agreement with my revisions.  The form Gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for the first project.  I change to reflect the change we made at that time.  As you will notice it is quite a few changes.  However, since Gregg signed off on this form once already, they shouldn't have a problem doing it again.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I reviewed the draft you forwarded.  Looks good.  I have the following two questions:  Section 1.1 - The fourth sentence down in the parenthesis "(whether owned or leased by LESSEE)".  Shouldn't that read "(whether owned, operated, or leased by LESSEE)" since Mariner only operates the Property for MEGS?  Term  -  Shouldn't the term mirror the term for the Production Handling Agreement?  Section 7.1.2.e allows termination after January 1, 2005.  Why would Marathon want to terminate while the PHA is still in effect?       "Bradley G Penn" <BGPenn@MarathonOil.com> 06/14/2000 09:16 AM

 Will,  Sharon left a voice mail indicating that you could set me up with a set of clubs on Saturday.  That sounds great.  I will plan on playing with you guys tomorrow.  Thanks. 
 I will review and get back to you by no later than tommorrow.      Stephanie Miller@ENRON 07/07/2000 01:30 PM 
 Marlene,  I am not sure what you are asking me to do.  If these contracts are active then they should be put into whatever is the proper contract tracking system for these types of services contracts (transport, pooling, etc.).  If they are not active and are of no value, then they probably should not be put into the database.  However, this is not a legal question, but a business question.  If the business decision is made that they are of no value and inactive, then they should be terminated in accordance with their terms.  Let me know if I am missing the point of your question.  If I am not, then I will return these contracts to you.       Marlene Hilliard 07/07/2000 12:17 PM 
 Kay,  Please see attached.  Thanks. 
 Ruth,  Attached is a redline with my revisions.  I will be forwarding two hard copies of the revisions to your attention.

 Dan and Teresa,  Attached is the form of declaration of Managing Member under which Crescendo appoints ENA to exclusively negotiate a gathering deal with Wildhorse.  Please review.     Teresa,  Do you think we need to get the Class B member approval also for this appointment of ENA as representative?  The LLC Agreement is open with respect to the Managing Member delegating its duties.  Dan or Ward,  Please note that the Crescendo LLC Agreement Section 6.3 indicates that if the Managing Member request the Class C Member (Enron) to provide certain financial or technical services, then Class C Member may do so for market based rates.  Is it the intention that Enron be reimbursed for any commercial or engineering services it provides to the LLC such as negotiating with Wildhorse or Project Management of the Plant Construction?

 Attached is a draft of the Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS (Seller) and ECT (Buyer) with a confirm for Bisti  and Bloomfield.  These mirror the Master Firm Purchase and confirms between ECC (Seller) and ECS (Buyer).  Please review.  Per our discussion yesterday, ECT will take title at the West Texas Pool and transport off of TW under the existing transport contract between TW and ECT.  Mark,  I wasn't sure who needed to see this on ECT's commercial side, so please forward to whomever is appropriate.

 Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege   Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota production is committed.  Please review and provide comments.  To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement:  1.  Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday.  Brett also forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.  The correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.  No demands were made by Enogex and no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.  Brett stated that the Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications. Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or Questar.  I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release the gas.  He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.  2.  I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.  Nothing really useful.  There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought these assets were in a state of economic viability decline.  Unfortunately this letter was not directed to Enogex.  However, the draft letter takes that position with Wildhorse.  3.  I am securing local consul out of Denver.  I want someone intimately familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective to be involved.  We may need to seek a declaratory order.   We have run into to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown. Should have this resolved on Monday.  4.  Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.  This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.  However, to reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.  The fact that the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts, allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in default. 
 Joan,  The contract states that Wildhorse only has to accept gas from Crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept.  Per Brett Frie at Enogex, the Entrada production is 24% Nitrogen.  Until the plant is up and running, this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs.  I am not sure how we get the Nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant?  The Dakota production was not mentioned in the letter, because I have no facts about the gas quality of this gas.  You had forwarded emails last week indicating the Dan Reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream of Wildhorse's plant.  Once we have these facts we can send a letter concerning the Dakota.  Do you have any info on these samples?      Joan Quick 07/24/2000 07:17 PM 
 Have you worked your way back into the real world yet or are you still adjusting?  This week has been pretty busy already and it is only Tuesday. Want to try and hook up for lunch tomorrow?  Let me know how your schedule looks. 
 Here is the term sheet.  Chris can you give me a complete list of counterparties, with pricing and volume information for each counterparty. 
 Tomorrow at noon sounds good.  I have primarily been working on Denver stuff.  Although a new project up in Denver.  One that I wish I hadn't gotten involved in.  I also need to hit the gym.

 Attached is my draft revised term sheet for the producer purchase agreements.  Let me know if you have any comments. 
 Forgot to copy you on the original dist. 
 My thought is just to take all this language out and solely leave us on out if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the Precedent Agreement.  Counterparty might not go for it, but it would clear this issue up.      Barbara N Gray 07/26/2000 06:45 PM 
 Susan,  Attached are redlined copies of the CSA Amendments.  We made a change to the Monthly Contract Quantity to exclude Force Majeure events and Section 2.4 Shaft energy interruptions.  Please review and call me with any questions.  x-33512.  Since we have circulated the prior amendment, I think it would avoid the most confusing by giving these amendments a new execution date.  I also added a section which specifices that these versions replace the amendments dated June 18, 1999.  The NBV letter values will also be redone.  The numbers will have to be changed.  The investors have asked that instead of a Contract Year Schedule, a quarterly schedule be included.   I don't have the numbers from Mark yet, but will forward those changes as soons as I get them.  Mark indicated that he had discussed these changes with both you and David. 
 Attached is the latest version of the Wildhorse Entrada Letter.  Please review.  I reviewed the letter with Jim Osborne and Ken Krisa yesterday and should get their comments today.  My plan is to Fedex to Midland for Ken's signature tomorrow morning and from there it will got to Wildhorse. 
 Please review.  Thanks. 
 Short and sweet.  Comments?

 Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals docs, per your voicemail.  Chris,  I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you earlier.  In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Ken,  Attached is the letter.  Please sign and forward the original to Kent Harris via Fedex.  We should request a signature acceptance of the letter and a confirmation receipt of such signature acceptance for our files.  The letter has a header for Crescendo on it.  Not sure if you had stationary for Crescendo yet.  Send a signed copy to me  and I will copy all the Enron CCs.  Gerald Nemec EB3883 1400 Smith St. Houston, Tx 77002  cc Carter Mathies, Don Opersteny, and Steve Huckaby to the same address as Kent Harris  cc Tom Dyk and Pete Scherer at Tom Brown 555 17th St., Suite 1850 Denver, CO 80202  Let me know if you have any questions and thanks for all your help. 
 Attached are clean and redline versions. 
 Carol,  Attached is the revised letter.  Per the voicemail I left last week, please let me know if there are any issues with us stating the prepay in this letter.  Also when is TW expecting the payment to be wired.  Need that date. 
 FYI,  Attached is the final version of the letter that was sent to Wildhorse. 
 Attached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on my discussions with Chris last week.  These have been only redlined against the prior version, not the original versions.  Let me know if you want redlines against the original docs.  The LLC was not included as no changes were made from the versions already forwarded.  With respect to the cash out imbalance procedures. The Administrative Services Agreement (Exhibit B) currently has a rough procedure for such cashout.  It is also written such that the Members can adopt a new procedure at any time.  If the current procedures are not sufficient, it probably make the most sense to have only a working draft (approved by the members) of procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to work out the bugs.  Scott Sitter will be developing this draft.  The development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions. A final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members upon development of those final procedures.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I will be out the 17th and 18th.      Pat Radford 07/31/2000 04:35 PM 
 Arvel,  I received your pressure data.  Unfortunately the contract pressure is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.  Any chance we would have any such data? Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data.  Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?  Thanks for your help. 
 Ken,  Wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure data on Wildhorse for the period of 3 years prior to the Effective Date of the Gathering Agreement?  I think Jim was going to look and see if he had any such data.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will create executables.  Thanks.

 Confidential Work Product - Attorney Client Privilege  Dan,  Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution.  As the situation stands now, Wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as follows:  1.  Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment. If they do so, then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo, one of which is release of the gas.  You are right, there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives. That is a risk I pointed out early.  However, in our letter to Wildhorse, I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks.  If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice: A.  Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract.  This will take time.  Depending on court docket loads, 6 months to 1 year.  B.  Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in   good faith and we consider the gas released (contract breached by Wildhorse) and that we will build our own system.  Then Crescendo would   build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse.  2.  Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms.  The only complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream.  Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.  After your field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation.  If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant.  If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them "under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees?".  They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability.      Dan J Bump@ENRON 08/01/2000 05:23 PM

 Eric, Need your help on this.  Let's get a copy of the grazing lease that Candy is referring to in the E-mail.  I am not clear on what she means by having Merl operate the well.

Attached is a confidentiality agreement which Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see such data.

 Hope you had a safe journey back from the land of Cabo.  We made it back without a problem.  I am really getting hammered at work today.  Reality baby!  Apparently my clients just can't do without me.  What did you guys do on your last night?  Let me guess. El Squid Roe.  Did your partners meet any new family members?  I really had a great time hanging out with you.  It made my trip that much more memorable to be with a special person like you.  Drop me a note when you get a chance and let me know how you are.  Take care, Gerald. 
 Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts.

 GT,  Man you are killing me with that story of the naked blonde.  I almost cried for not going now.  Is she still married, because if not I want to propose.  Cabo was pretty sweet.  Plenty of sun, sand, and women.  Hooked up with a chick from Seattle for most of the week and had a great time.  We went fishing one day and caught a 100 lb. swordfish.  Took a portion of it to a restaurant and they cooked it for us.  Awesome.  There were tons of Honeymoon couples down there.  You might want to check it out.  It is a short flight and pretty reasonably priced.  They have some great hotels as well.  I will be coming in for the Houston game weekend after next, so have my room ready.  Talk at ya later.  G

 Attached are the latest schedules and supplements.  Still waiting on the revised financial statements. 
 Attached are a clean and redline version with my changes. 
 This is incredible.  The kid was a life long Aggie Fan, makes one trip to Austin and commits to UT.  I think we have finally found the guy to win it all for us (MB).   Also now Chance is saying he will actively recruit for us.  He wants this years class to be better than last years class.  I think a few phone calls to Roy Williams and BJ Johnson.  I can't wait til August.  When are you coming back guy.  Are you ready for some football? 
 Attached for review is a redline of the latest revisions to Schedules to the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Also attached are various supplements to the schedules.  The only items not included are the Capital Account Balances - Schedule 3.1(g) and the Financial Statements - Schedule 3.1(i).  Karry Kendall will be forwarding those shortly this evening.    Also attached is Exhibit A-2.  This is an item description of the equipment included in the EMS gathering systems.  I also forwarded Exhibit D - Specified Geographical Area and Exhibit A-1 - Map of the EMS Gathering System earlier today via FEDEX.  You should have those tomorrow morning. 
 Hi Dee Dee  OK, It is at about this point in time when my thoughts turn to my next vacation.  Jeez, criminy (little Seattle lingo) have I been busy this week. Looking forward to the weekend to chill out a little.  No big plans but to enjoy the college football extravaganza on Saturday.  Maybe grill some beast depending on the weather and partake of a few sodas.  It has been raining here all week which is good, because at least it isn't 107 degrees out.  My clients in Denver wanted a full download on all my Cabo activities.  These are the guys who have been to Cabo several times including the 20/20 club. As a matter of fact, the project I am working on right now for these guys is called Project 20/20.  Coincidence, I don't think so.  Anyway, when I told them I met this girl who went to 20/20 with me, they were very impressed. They now hold me in higher esteem than before.  At least that's one way to gain the respect of your clients.  So how is the great Northwest? Have your told grandparents about the wonderful time you had in Cabo with some strange guy walking around in your shoes.  Some details are probably better left out.  I am about out of here.  Take care and I will talk to you later.  Gerald 
 Attached is the revised agreement with Utah added.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Attached is a redlined version of the schedules with changes for the sales/use taxes on EMS materials.  All other supplements to the schedules remain unchanged. 
 Eva,  All the references are conditional upon term conversion occurring prior to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to closing.  We plan on leaving the references as they exist.  Let me know if you have any questions.      Eva Neufeld@ENRON 09/16/2000 03:50 PM 
 Jere,  I have reviewed the draft and everything looks fine except for the $10 million cap.  Dave and I had discussed a $2 million cap.  I would request that the $2 million cap be inserted.  Please let me know if you have any questions.      "Bates, Jere" <jbates@tristategt.org> 09/18/2000 12:02 PM

 Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules to the Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Also attached, for the sake of completeness, are the supplements to the schedules.  The supplements are the same as prior versions, except for some changes to the title defects schedules for the Maverick, Box Draw, and Caballo systems.  I attempted to redline the schedules for the title defects, but it redlined the whole list.  The only change of substance added was a new Wyoming DOT road crossing permit to Maverick.  Also taken off were references to the documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was contained in brackets and began "[See Attached ....].  That information was for the right of way agents in Gillette so that they knew what documents had been prepared for them.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached are clean versions of the 20/20 Schedules 
 I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never turned myself into a human candle.  I did spend several years as an altar boy.  We got to wear those cool outfits also.  How are you doing?  Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.  This is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.      "Emmye" <emmye@dracospring.com> 09/19/2000 04:42 PM 
 Hi Kelly,    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does a flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.  I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably go.      "Kelly OBrien" <kjobrien@duke-energy.com> 09/18/2000 10:53 PM 
 I will check with my bro, to see if he is interested and let you know.  Get some sleep.   Talk at ya later.      "Mark Miller" <mmiller3@austin.rr.com> 09/20/2000 11:06 AM 
 Are you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from you.  Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down to Cabo for good. 
 Craig,  Attached is a short outline concerning the approach we discussed earlier.  Please review and let me know if you agree. 
 Hi Katie,  Remember me.  Not sure if this is still your email address, but thought I would check and see.  Hope you are doing well and school is going well.  If you are still out there drop me a line! 
 Hi Mom,   Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  I have just been pretty busy at work and on the weekends.  Seems like there is not enough hours in the day.  I did go down to Cabo for a week.  It was a blast.  We partied way too much.  Everything else is going fine.  My roommate moved in at the beginning of September.  So far so good.  Hope everything is going well down in CC.  Love yall and talk to you later.  Gerald      Edward Nemec <ednemec@earthlink.net> 09/08/2000 08:04 AM

 Might try this for the bar, while at the bar. 
 GT,  I am planning on driving in Sat.  I will probably leave Houston around 9 am.  Should be in Austin at lunch time.  I can't remember exactly how to get to your casa.  Can you drop me some directions again.  Thanks. 
 Emmye,  I seem to have misplaced your work #.    Drop me a note when you get a chance with your #.

 Hi Katie,    Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.  I have been out of town for awhile.  Good to hear from you again.  I understand about the summer.  Sometimes we get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing.  I had a good summer.  My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado in August.  Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.  I spent four days up there.  My whole family made the trip, so that was cool. The weather up there is awesome.  I played around of golf and I don't think it ever got above about 75 degrees.  They had the reception at the Stanley Hotel.  This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the inspiration to write the Shining.  No weird events occurred at the reception though.  I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.  I spent 8 days down there with some friends.  Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and dancing.  Not necessarily in that order though.  I was a little worried about being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying till 4 am and sleeping til noon.  Enron is going well.  We just closed another big deal last week, so the pressure is off for now again.  There will surely be another next quarter. Can't wait .  I feel for you concerning statistics.  Actually that was one of the courses that gave me the most problems in engineering school.  I must admit I probably didn't try as hard as I should have.  I just hated the course so much that I just wanted to get it over with.  Hang in there.   You will get through it.  Is this your last semester?  If I remember correctly, I thought you were going to graduate in December.  It is really good to hear from you again.  Take care and drop me a note when you get a chance.  Gerald 
 Attached is a revised nomination letter incorporating comments received. Please review 
 Hi Dee,  I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.  I hope everything with you and your family is as well as it can be right now.  I will say a prayer for yall.  I am doing good.  Staying busy with work as you suggested.  Actually we closed our big deal last Thursday.  That will allow my hours to become somewhat more normal in the near future.  They are planning a trip to reward those who worked so hard on this deal.  Guess where? Cabo.  Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.  They won, fortunately.  It was good to see some old friends and hang out.   I wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they can lowball you on the cash.  Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.  Take care and talk to you later.     "Karry Howton" <howton.k@ghc.org> 09/22/2000 05:19 PM 
 A redlined version with my changes.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Barbara,  I put hard copies of these documents in your chair. 
 Attached is a rough draft of a response letter to Wildhorse concerning the nominations.  Barbara and I are still reviewing, so there will be some further changes, but in the interest of time, I thought I would send this out for everyone's review. 
 GT,  I think I will probably come in tonight since the game is so early.  Are you guys going to try and buy tickets at the gate for BB?    Email back with your phone numbers, so I can call if anything changes.  Talk at ya later.  G 
 Sounds like your little cousin is continuing to strike out on the airline tickets.  It really breaks my heart to see the once great web master fall so far. Maybe we should have assigned him the task of color coordinating his pants and shirts for the trip. 
 Not sure if you or someone in your group already had seen this. 
 Scott,  Attached is the memo from local counsel in Denver.  Per Barbara's voice mail, both her and I agree with the content of the memo.  Craig is an experienced litigator in Denver.  Please review and let's discuss. 
 Sorry for the delay.  Here is the letter 
 The pictures were very amusing.  Thanks for sending those along.  Looks like you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.  I especially like the candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.  Whoa, got to start working out and shed the love handles.  I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe since that is where you guys hung out most of the time.  Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.  I really don't follow Texas but I do follow the Astros.  I think everybody is just happy the season is over with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.  The Astros were pretty horrible this year.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this weekend?  I know that is probably impossible.  Thanks for the pics again and I'll talk to you later.  Gerald 
 I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period prior to the effect date of the agreement.  Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.  Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.

 fyi. 
 Davis,  This actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the Big 12 Game.  However, just because I at one time worked at the Posse doesn't mean my character should continue to be called into question.      Davis Thames@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/04/2000 09:27 AM 
 FYI,  The call to Kinder may not be needed. 
 Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.  Please note the italicized sections of the CSA.  I am not sure what the terms quoted to Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to energy pricing.  We may want to leave these sections blanks for now.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 The form of right of way looks good.  Go ahead and forward to the land owner. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my revisions.  The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded earlier via email.  Sorry for the delay.  I will be at the ENA Legal Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.  Please leave a voicemail if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Attached is a letter to TW notifying them of the CDEC rate increase and requesting their election on the pricing adjustment.  Please review.  We need to get this to TW asap. 
 I know.  I guess we should be used to it by now and learn to expect it.  I just need to emotionally distance myself from the Horns.  G$     Dan J Bump@ENRON Sent by: Dan J Bump@ENRON 10/09/2000 05:44 PM

 What's up rude-dog.  Haven't heard any new recruiting news.  I think it is going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season.  I was up in Denver this past week and talked to Jessica Wentworth.  She said you have been exploring the Australian countryside.  Bet there is some amazing stuff down under.  Anyway, drop me a note and let me know how its going.  I know I have asked this before, but when are you getting into town?  We need to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival.

 Did you take the LSAT and kick its butt already?  I thought you were scheduled to take that recently.  You are probably wishing you have more stuff to study on the weekends. 
 I am forwarding these to you with the condition that you are not allowed to send these to any of your uppity OU cronies.    - TexasFight.jpg - Score+Board.jpg 
 How dare you take such a tone with my counsellor.  You're just bitter that you have squandered all rights to your furniture.  Face it, your furniture likes me better anyway now. 
 GT,  How is it going?  Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took from OU.  Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.  I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.  I might have my brother and another friend with me.  How are you set for space.  Those guys could crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.  If it is a problem, just let me know and we can make other arrangements.  Talk at ya later  G 
 Hi Katie,  You guys would love Cozumel.  Short flight, very cheap, and lots of fun.  If any of you Scuba Dive, Cozumel has some of the best diving in the world.  I had a blast down there.  Hope your Stats. class is going OK.  Unfortunately, I think that is one of those classes the just requires more effort than most classes.  Work hasn't been too busy for me lately.  However, I know that will change as we get closer to the end of the year.  I do have a trip to Spain planned for November.  Some friends and I will be going over the Thanksgiving week.  We are flying into Madrid and will also go to Lisbon, Portugal.  Other than that we will work our way around the coast on the South of Spain.  I am really looking forward to it.  Hope everything else is going well for you.  Are you sure you don't want to go for your Phd once you graduate.      : -) 
 Was curious if you heard anything further on this?  I haven't called again. Debating whether I should.  Any plans to go up to Estes anytime soon?     Sharon Snyder <ssnyder@shelton.org> 10/12/2000 02:54 PM 
 Things are going good in legal.  I am getting to work on some interesting stuff.  I just finished working on a compressor deal with Mark Courtney.  It was an asset and finance deal.  I got to work with the finance commercial and legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time.  It is hard to keep up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of knowledge at this point.  Tense but fun.  I didn't see the any of the high school all star games.  I heard Babers and Turner both looked very good in the Texas- California game.  Sounds like they were covering some 6'5" bad asses from California and pretty much shut them down.  At least that most other peoples opinion.  Sounds like Kenny Hayter look pretty good.  Leading Texas rusher.  He sounds like a power runner not a real juker.  I am really worried about the NC State game.  It would suck to lose the home opener, but I think that is a very real possibility.  Their quarterback sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers, ala UCLA.  I still think we will at least go 7-4 probably 9-2 best case.  Your right though.   If we fall flat with 5-6 or something it will slow the momentum Mack is building. I just don't think that will happen.  Mack is too smart and can really get these kids to overchieve.  I think his players believe and are motivated to play hard.  Mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like James Brown.  When you think about it though, Mack following Mackovic is really going to pay dividends in the long run.  Mack Brown and Greg Davis weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at UNC.  But Mackovic had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which Mack and Greg picked right up on.  Now we have kids like Mock, Williams, and Johnson wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone.  I like it.  It is going to be fun in about 2 years with the quality of kids we are now getting.  I will think about the groups I have worked with and let you know on any areas to go.  I have worked a lot with Larry Lawyer in the finance group and know he is looking work people.  I don't know if this was the same stuff you did in Denver or the same group.   Might be.  Those guys do work a lot of hours.  Almost as bad as attorneys.  I will give it some thought.  Well, all for now.  Keep in touch.  I am glad you are going to be back in Houston.  We will have some fun.  I want to hear all about how much you really like Australian women or more specifically, how much they like you.  G$

 Mike, I reviewed the pages to the site you provided.  My only comment right now is that the correct name of the pipeline is "Houston Pipe Line Company". Note the Pipe Line is two words.  Everything else looks fine.  We will be getting back with you on the site access agreement. 
 Mark,  Attached are riders to be added to the CIG  Confidentiality Agreement.  Please forward these for review to the proper persons at Coastal.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 We should again nominate to NWPL .  In our nomination we can state that if Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to Questar solely to mitigate damages.  I can draft the appropriate letter.  Joan or Ken,  Will the nominations be done via the web site?  Do we have the information to nominate to NWPL via the website?     "Ken" <kckrisa@apex2000.net> 10/23/2000 08:57 AM Please respond to kckrisa 
 I Love You! 
 Audrey,  Attached is a term sheet that Barbara Gray prepared some time back for the OE agreement.  Please review.  How does tomorrow afternoon look for you.  About 2:00 pm. 
 Wednesday works for me.  Morning would be a good time for me.     Audrey O'Neil 10/23/2000 01:58 PM 
 Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the letter such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event that Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages. Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it there.  From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.      "Ken" <kckrisa@apex2000.net> 10/23/2000 02:37 PM Please respond to kckrisa 
 Hi Janel,  We have a couple of things on the agenda.  Friday night is Fastball at the Engine Room.  We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House prior to the show.  Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer.  Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.  Some placed called Americas near Enron Field.  Never heard of it.  There are about 3 other bands. Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.  Show starts at 7 pm.  Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.  There are about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.  If you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.  Let me know.      Janel Guerrero@ENRON 10/24/2000 08:31 AM 
 No acid rock, just good easy listening tunes.  Fastball had the hit about 2 years ago called The Way.  Toadies; they just rock.  We will probably dress as under-appreciated, under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys.     Janel Guerrero@ENRON 10/24/2000 10:58 AM 
 I would be happy to handle this, unless you want to.  Let me know.  Thanks. 
 Can you place these on my calendar please.  Thanks. 
 Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.  The right to match option is a little less drastic than the "saving sharing" we discussed.  The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.  We can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Attached for your review is a form of assignment for the Trailblazer Precedent Agreement between ENA and Trailblazer.  This assigns the PA from ENA to J.M. Huber Corporation. 
 A note from Bieraugel.  We need to go out and see these guys when we get a chance.  Hang in there.  Things will start to come around, it is just going to take some time. 
 FYI 
 Are you sure you want to take such a bold stand?  You are kind of throwing= =20 monkeys to the wind.  Actually isn't NU red and OU crimson. 
 Chris,  Attached is a redlined of the revised ENA - Lost Creek IT Agreement. The changes you noted are incorporated.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  If this is acceptable I can print executables.  Let me know.  Thanks. 
 Attached are redlines of the revised Capacity Release Agreement and the Revised Transaction No. 2.  Please review. 
 Mark,  As far as I know, this hasn't been delivered to TW yet.  If you could print this on paper with an Enron Logo only.   I already have the ECS header on the document.  Steve Harris would be the right party.      Mark Knippa 10/30/2000 08:31 AM 
 Attached is a draft letter to Wildhorse for our noms. in November.  The letter again reserves all our rights.  Please review.  Mark,  Is the cc list still correct? 
 Ken,  Attached is the letter with a few slight revisions.  We added Bob Mustard to the cc list.  We are all ok with this version.  If you are fine with this please fax and mail hard copy as we have done before.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me at (713) 853-3512. 
 I am currently working on the draft GTC and revised product descriptions. Should have draft by tommorrow.    Carlos Alatorre@ENRON 10/30/2000 09:51 AM 
 Hi Sophie,  I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.  I will have extra Sherry on mine.  How is it going?  I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with you at the Brown Bar.  I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get creative when the circumstances require.    I was moving a little slow the next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant.  Did you have a good weekend?  I didn't do anything real exciting for the weekend before Halloween.  Went to a concert that had 4 bands.  One of them is a band from Austin called Vallejo.  Heard of them?  Now tell me the truth.  Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?  Drop me a line when you get a chance.  Gerald

 Thought you might find the attached interesting.  I don't know if any of the people you are talking to are on this list, but might be worth checking. 
 My comments are redlined into the doc..

 Attached for review are a draft of the GTC and Product Description for the transport capacity transactions on EOL.  Please review and provide comments.  Carl, If you want to meet to discuss, just let me know when. 
 Please see attached.  Thanks 
 Ken,      Attached is the CA with my comments. 
 A few interesting deals.  Working on some products for Enron's B2B internet trading site.  "www.enrononline.com"  The site was actually developed out of our London office.  Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace. Some other trading deals as well.  I usually get a pretty mixed bag of projects to work.  It has been very busy the last couple of days.  Sophie Therapy?  That sounds extremely interesting.  Is it good for most of your normal life crisis type issues?  I might need some now and again.  I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state was not clearest it could have been.  Are you a student at UT Law?  Forgive me for my mental lapses.  OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type substance.  Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not sure about the Yorkshire.  Might help to wash it down with a nice pint.  Take care, Gerald.    "Sophie Davenport" <sophiedavenport@hotmail.com> 10/31/2000 10:31 AM 
 I revised paragraph 11.  Let me know if it addresses your concerns. 
 I will be attending the lunch on Wednesday for Crescendo. 
 Pat,  I will be out Nov. 17, 21, 22, 23, 27.      Pat Radford 11/02/2000 11:30 AM 
 Jackie,  Could you have the Entex Contract the Mike mentions pulled and forwarded to me.  Thanks. 
 I actually knew all of that information!  I was just checking your story to make sure it was consistent with what you told me that night.  Everything seems to be in order.  Good!      "Sophie Davenport" <sophiedavenport@hotmail.com> 11/01/2000 07:10 PM 
 If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.  Otherwise Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's control.  But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the agreement now.      Mark Whitt@ENRON Sent by: Mark Whitt@ENRON 11/02/2000 05:42 PM 
 I haven't answered him yet.  I just plan to let him know that the contracts should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter. Any thoughts? 
 Mike,  Still working on it.  Should have a draft by late Monday or Tuesday. Sorry about the delay.      Michael Eiben 11/03/2000 09:17 AM 
 Ron,  Attached is the assignment with my change redlined.  If you want to discuss, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.  Thanks. 
 FYI.  We are currently executing a CA with Tom Brown to begin review of the system for a possible purchase by Crescendo or Enron North America. 
 That is it!  I don't know the how and when, but I intend to devote the rest of my life to bringing down Stoops and the OU football program.  You will rue the day my friend.     Paul.Pfeffer@bakerbotts.com 11/06/2000 08:24 AM 
 I will remove the open season reference.  Some pipeline tariffs do refer to open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to remove it.  The terms you referenced are defined in the product description.  The EOL access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on the counterparty.     Colleen Sullivan 11/06/2000 12:42 PM 
 Attached are a redlined revised version of the GTC and the Product Description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions. Carlos, I made a few slight changes to the product description you sent earlier today   Please review. 
 Russell,  The 2nd Huber transaction was executed and Huber is contractually bound to take assignment of the transportation.  We have gotten approval of the assignment form from the Pipeline and expect to execute the assignments and capacity release documents with Huber next week.  The capacity release document just specifies the details of the capacity release.  Huber is bound by the 2nd transaction to accept our release.    I will let you know when these sets of documents are executed.  Let me know if you have any questions.      Russell Diamond 11/03/2000 11:08 AM 
 Ken,  Attached is the form of ROW Agreement and Exhibit B that goes along with it. 
 I am composing this as we speak.  Should have a draft shortly.      Michael J Legler@ENRON Sent by: Michael J Legler@ENRON 11/06/2000 08:32 AM 
 Carlos,  Made one change.  Wanted to be clear that Buyer's bid shall reflect the Contract Price, Period of Delivery etc.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached are redlines of the latest revisions.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Mark,  Attached is the final GTC and  product description for our capacity release EOL product. 
 Hi Marsha,    How is it going?  Nothing really exciting since Cabo.  Just work.  I am about to go to Spain for  8 days.  Should be fun.  Amazingly, I may be going back to Cabo in December for a business trip.  Don't ask me how I pulled that off.  Are you ready to go back and use your time share?   Good to hear from you.  Tell Shannon hello.  Take care.     Marsha Lybra <make_up_pro@yahoo.com> 11/06/2000 06:17 PM 
 Attached is the final version of the GTC for the EOL Capacity Release. 
 Carlos,  Looks fine to me.  Thanks. 
 Hi Melissa,  Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they keep you busy at V&E.  Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group.  Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, but I might know them.  Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location?  In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!   Gerald 
 Attached is a redline with the changes per my discussion with Colleen. Please review. 
 Greg,  Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the discussion we had yesterday.  I left the reimbursement provision open with only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the interconnect in some form.  I made some assumptions about equipment that either party would install, however this can easily be changed.  I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.  I think this would be best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront payment before we buy or build anything.  Take a look at the draft and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Revised GTC 
 Attached is the revised GTC based on the latest discussion concerning secondary points.  Attached is a clean and redlined version. 
 One more revision to the GTC.  Few changes based on my discussion with Carl this morning.  I have attached a clean and redlined copy.  The redline is compared against the version prior to the secondary point discussion for Colleen's benefit.  I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective unless Dick or Colleen had any comments. 
 Eric, The agreement needs to be bi-directional.  The subject is an exchange of information concerning Petroglyph's transportation contract Colorado Interstate Gas Company.  Paul is going to provide the date of the contract and the contract #. 
 Sorry for the delay.  Please review the attached draft.  If it looks OK we can send to Ken for execution.        Joan Quick 11/09/2000 01:38 PM 
 Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob Vila's "This Old House".  Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you "commoners" like to refer.  Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside of 2 days.  Matt,  If you are still gassy by next week, you will be rooming with Eric and Jen.     jennifer-gillaspie@reliantenergy.com 11/09/2000 02:56 PM 
 By the way, it should be "two knuckleheads" instead of "to". 
 Attached is the draft.  Please review.  I left a question about the cash-out index.  Please let me know what is appropriate. 
 Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.  I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point. That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.  South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?      "Beckworth, Melissa" <mbeckworth@velaw.com> 11/09/2000 11:59 AM 
 Joan,  I am going to make your noted change and forward executables to Crescendo.     Joan Quick 11/09/2000 04:19 PM 
 Tommorrow at 2:00 or later works for me.  Thanks 
 Mark,  Attached are clean versions of the set of documents to be executed by Huber.      The following are redlines copies of the documents that were changed from our prior versions.       Mark,  A couple of notes:  1.  In the capacity release agreement - Are the volumes specified in Section 2.1 correct?  Or do these need to be grossed up for fuel? 2.  In Section 2.4, I took out any requirement of Huber to release WIC Capacity back to ENA if the start date under the purchase agreement occurs later than the start of the term of the WIC Capacity Release from ENA to Huber which we will effectuate soon.  Is this correct? 
 Hey,  Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you are in town this week.  The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?  G      kjobrien@duke-energy.com 11/10/2000 01:24 PM

 Mary,  Thanks for the invite to the Open House.  Unfortunately, I will be out of the country on vacation next week.  Have a Happy Thanksgiving. 
 You are very welcome!  I enjoyed it.  Thanks for the name of the city.  We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so we'll try to check it out.  Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be interesting?  Probably won't be able to find turkey, dressing, or american football anywhere.   Any fun plans for the Thanksgiving holiday?     "Beckworth, Melissa" <mbeckworth@velaw.com> 11/14/2000 02:49 PM

 Hey Melissa,  I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow. We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I guess I'll get through them.  Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and at the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold my tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.  We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you told me at lunch!  Take care,  Gerald 
 Hello!  Yes, I leave for Spain tomorrow at 1:30.  We arrive in Madrid about 8 am on Sat. Morning.  We will be in Madrid a couple of days, then spend our time in some towns south of Madrid for about 3 days.    The last couple of days we will be in Lisbon, Portugal.  Back in Houston next Monday.    Should be a good time.  I will let you guys know all about it at Christmas time.  Sounds like yall had a fun trip to Big Bend.  I have wanted to see the McDonalds Observatory.  That sounds pretty cool.  Anyway,  thanks for the updates and I will talk to you as soon as I get back.  Gerald      Edward Nemec <ednemec@earthlink.net> 11/16/2000 10:40 AM

 I have not received this back yet.  I will call Ken today.     Joan Quick 11/28/2000 04:27 PM 
 Ken,  I sent, via fedex, an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago. The agreement appointed ENA as Crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.  Wanted to see if you have reviewed and executed yet? 
 Attached is a letter to Wildhorse consenting to the assignment of Crescendo's gathering agreements from Wildhorse to Tom Brown.  The letter reserves all our rights for Wildhorse's breach.  Also attached is a letter for December nominations into Questar reserving our rights.  Please review and provide any comments. 
 The letter looks fine Nicole.  Only checked it for form and not substance since I didn't have the agreement to which it is referring.      Nicole Cortez@ENRON Sent by: Nicole Cortez@ENRON 11/30/2000 11:20 AM 
 Attached is the letter.  Please review.  I am still giving it one read over. 
 I made one small change, but this one is ready to go as far as I am concerned. 
 The attached redline document includes the various language changes we discussed today and some other small changes.  These are in addition to the action items that EES was going to pursue. 
 This is the latest draft.  EES is also making some further changes (discussed yesterday) which aren't reflected in this version. 
 I am glad you asked me to lunch today.  I do enjoy spending time with you even though at times it is tough and our conversations are hard right now.  I do Love You so much and have a Vision. 
 Jere,  I have the confidentiality agreements fully executed on our side.  What is your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.  Thanks. 
 Hi MB,  Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see if you would want to meet for a drink after work today? 
 Mark,  I reviewed the CSA for our obligations.  They are as follows:  1.  ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule.  2.  If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW to develop a manual system to accomplish the same.  ECS will keep TW whole on any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system.  This provision was written very generally.      Mark Knippa 12/01/2000 10:45 AM 
 I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with everything else. 
 I can't hear you!! La La La La La La La..................... 
 No problem.  I figured you weren't feeling well.  Sorry to hear that you are still sick.  You might want to call the doc.  I have been able to described my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me (Antibiotics or similar).  Good luck with Global Markets.  Sounds like you had a lot of good opportunities.  I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a better originator if you ever want to go back to origination.  I am pretty open right now for lunch.  Maybe Wednesday.  Let me know.      Lisa Nemec 12/04/2000 09:14 AM 
 Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and sound from Spain.  Spain is really a neat country.  Very charming.  So I got James' name huh?  Who got my name in the drawing?  When is everyone coming in for the holiday?  I am planning on coming down the 23rd. 
 Dan,  Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated. 
 I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.  We have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 year period, with no response from Wildhorse.  We need to reinforce the curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits. I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending. 
 Attached is my revised letter.  Please call with any questions. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the following:  1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only remedies. 2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent with each other.  The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss. 
 Attached is the revised letter based on Chris' voicemail on Friday.  I also added a 30 day window during which ENAP must provide the data to Enron. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Note that we still need to legal entity's name from the South America office. 
 We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good.  I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it though.  Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in Mississippi.      kjobrien@duke-energy.com 12/10/2000 07:10 PM

 I will be revising the Capacity Release and Agreement and the existing Trailblazer Assignment that Huber currently has to reflect the Transaction just completed today.  Mark,  you probably should make Huber aware of this if they are not already so.  Thanks.      Chris Meyer 12/13/2000 04:41 PM 
 Hey Melissa,  Are you back from Brazil yet?  Hope they didn't work you too hard down there.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.
