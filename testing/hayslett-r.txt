 Sounds like they have a deal already. 
 What do you think we should focus on for the crew?     Attached is a data sheet that I would like to keep up as things change.    Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 Was it an actual downgrade or just that they wouldn't agree not to do so? -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 FYI 
 The $550 of debt that is in the calcualtion assumes we borrow the 550 next week.   Otherwise there is only 17 or so there. 
 FYI 
 Service agreements and construction jobs, as well as capital expenditure, obligate Enron and as a result the rules for RAC approval for commitments apply.    Please get Denis or James involved on all appropriate deals.  Thanks. Rod 
 I would like Morris Brassfield and Carolyn Centilli to play this role. 
 I apologize for the confusion but the interviews are being cancelled at thi= s time.     Thank you for your patience and assistance in getting us ready = to go.

 Which company? 
 Where do you stand on this stuff now?  For everyone, if we are going to get this done, we need things taken care of.    If there is a problem you need to let us know ASAP! 
 Do you have a candidate?    I would argue that we are looking at a process review, so anyone who can do a process review could do this.
