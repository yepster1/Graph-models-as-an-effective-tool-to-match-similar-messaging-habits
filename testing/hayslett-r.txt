Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the "Database" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions and I will attempt to get you through them.    I can also get you set up to get even more detailed answers if you would like.  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178     Rod,  Thanks for the email.  Can you help me match the information in this email to your operating plan or cash flow analysis?

 That is understood.    He will be taking Glisan's position which had the same restrictions on it.    I don't plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions.   There would be no purpose in giving him E&F data.  By the wya, Kevin needs to do the Marketing Affiliate stuff. 
 Aren't you being a little rough on her on a problem that really doesn't make any difference to Dynegy? 
 FYI 
 Per you request: Also make sure that Jeff Sommers added his name to his list.   There is a separate wind retention program.

 I am going to begin discussions with the banks as soon as we get the Phase 5 financing locked down.     I would expect that we could have it in another month, unless I run into some kind of a buzz-saw out there, and I'll let you know as soon as I do. 
 If necessary I can go.  I will need to be in Houston on Wednesday am. 
 I'm on board. 
 No, because they are in networks. 
 FYI.    I understand Jim needs Tom Meers to review # 17 
 Are you OK? 
 I want to make sure that we are looking out for our people at this point in time.    If there is someone who is having a particular problem, now is a time to be comforting.   I also want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to reduce spending.   If you have a vacancy, now may be the time to consider do you really have to fill that job right now.

 As to P6, it is in the budget for next year, but we want to start this year.     Timing is never perfect. 
 Do we want to tighten these up somewhat? 
 Sounds reasonable to me. 
 Great Ideas. 
 These would be in the debt tests performed for the lenders.    Do you know the answers? 
 Talk with Jim 
 CAn you 2 help her out here?    I believe the footnotes probably cover it, but to the extent you have more, it would be helpful.

 I am assuming that by now you know that I am pledging my receivables into the secured deal Dan Boyle is working on. 
 That is one of the things we are working on.   At this point in time Dynegy will be responsible for this debt, if theyexercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements, which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders.  The price they paid recognized the debt was there, if it is not there, the price will be higher.   Suffice it to say all of these things will be tken care of before it funds. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 I think Kathy has a new one out for the 7th. 
 The issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues.  A 13d filing is required.
