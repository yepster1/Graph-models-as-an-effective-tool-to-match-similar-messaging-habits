 Hi -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Please fix. 
 FYI 
 did you get mine? 
 Let me, as well as others, know the outcome. 
 Since we are no longer using Maverix, that guarantee can be done away with.    Are the rest all really with Enron?    In the underlying deals do we have any ability to ask for better than a guarantee if enron is downgraded? 
 FYI 
 Outside of normal business lines is outside of the pipelines and therefore is not subject to being an issue here. 
 This would be an Enron deal.    And we just have to get over the hurdles here. 
 Before we can sell the units need to be registered. 
 FYI 
 Can you help us out here from what you know?     I do not believe you can loan money to Enron.     Have you filed to be able to make the special dividend? 
 Great start. 
 Just forget about it, the company will not be reimbursing for attendance this year. 
 You need to begin thinking about what we could do here if we were asked to reduce staffing to save money? 
 I do not intend to approve reimbursement by the company for attendance.

 Great job! 
 Yes for sure. 
 The same to you and yours. 
 I have forwarded to Stan and agree with your perspective.    Could you begin to think about who those people might be if we decided to do something? 
 I guess I need some more definition.    If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it, this doesn't make sense.    Can I get some definitions to go over this with Stan?   I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.    Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.   I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.    Especially at the top.

 Do you have this data? 
 Thanks. 
 The data is actually aggregated and netted, the specific deal data is not provided.   The detail he described might be the aggregate of 40 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals.   See the bolded data below.

 FYI 
 Probably.   Please call Kathy Campos to get on my calendar.     the margins for 2001 and 2002 are not the same and I didn't think we had 2001 in the other model in detail.    Existing includes Gallup, and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for Gallup.   You can try, but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts.    You have to remember it was an expansion, not a separate system and therefore there is no way to track the flows after the fact. 
  This is a test for the blackberry. Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 What do you have to backup the 2001 and 2002 revenue projectoions for NNG? 
 They took bids and I think have an offer of about $60 MM or so.  Michael: What do you know about this one? 
 I have asked Kevin to sit in on this one for me.   Trailblazer on wednesday am. 
  I am having trouble getting this to you.   So I am trying again.     Also do you have any inventory that could be sold that is not encumbered already.   Trying to think about what could be done to improve your cash in the short term. 
 I have asked and will let you know the answer later today.    The bigger question is that they can not loan money to Enron and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.   More update later. 
 Is the cost center in question allocated or direct charged?  The corporate Enron Corp Business Controls cost center. 
 You can use my office but I may not be here. 
 Why do our numbers look so high in the 4th quarter and then fall off so much?     We have to get a better handle on all of this and fast. 
 I could probably do by phone and may be here. 
 I have been in discussions with them as well, and I don't think they have that flexibility.      Who has actually been working on the move for you?    I will have Pam Daily from my Admin Team contact you for specifics. 
 test2  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 Either Robert Guthrie or greek Rice. 
 The deal with the Banks is being held up by Paribas to get a cross-netting agreement with Enron.   I understand we have agreed and the documentation could be done as early as today.   Bill Bradford is working on this one.   So it's up to Enron to fix the problem at this point in time.   PAribas releases and we get the agreement in place and we can start moving these LC's. 
 This position is truly needed in Omaha to provide support as Patty suggests.    I only wish there was a way to move someone from here to there. 
 What is the next step at this point in time? 
 no 
 We probably need to get this stuff in the hands of a few more people to make this work smoothly. 
 Do you have anyone from Accounting?   Saunders? 
 55% TW and 45% NNG 
 The 2 of you should probably listen in on this stuff to make sure you don't have some of the info needed

Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?

I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.

 I think the biggest problem is that where are we going to get the funds for that? 
 FYI 
 Let's forward to the ETS Officer's for review/comments to be discussed monday am. 
 I think the real problem right now is that until the current crisis is over we need to reduce all calls for cash of any type to only those necessary to make cash today. 
 And we will give you something stating or reaffirming our deal, if that is deemed to be necessary.     It will be worth the paper it is written on at the moment it is written, but means nothing 1 second later, and that's the problem with these kind of things.     I guess my concern is what good will it do anyone?    I don't think it's a problem to get, however I do believe we would want to get V&E's opinion at the time we wanted it, that it was necessary/required. 
 Probably need additional review by someone now, given the current situation.  What do you think?  -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Agreed.     By the way we are very close to a deal and therefore a press release shortly thereafter.

 tHANKS. 
 What can we do about getting this done? 
 FYI 
 I am not sure, I just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of. 
 Can someone send us a synopsis of the changes in the plan and what the expected impact on NP and NBP services comapny is? 
 Let's try this time on for size! 
 We will have to do project economics by pipeline as well as in total.    A way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits received.      That way no one can argue that they didn't get the same deal.    If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint, then it should make sense from an individual pipeline standpoint.  Project economics need to be looked at in 2 ways.     1) The project economics on a stand alone basis and then 2) the more accurate approach of what does the project do to the entity (the with and without approach). The accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more important measure of success.

I will need these by the 29th of November for those in the accounting and finance ranks.   For all others I will need the input for the 13th of December.

 All OK> 
 Please provide whatever assistance you can in getting info to Tracy to respond to the attached request.

 Please approve and forward for payment.    Thanks. 
 I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.    I also understand that this is a part of the Revenue Management project. 
 I would like to have the dollars subdivided into pools for each of my direct reports with about 10% of my pool reserved for my use.    Can you help me with this?    I also understand that we are doing a handoff from Ben to Shanna for my support point, therefore I am sending this to both of you.  For Ben:    Where are we on the job description I sent 
 I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem. 
 I still have a PRC tomorrow am, but will let Kathy know my status as I get closer to lunch. 
 FYI 
 This is a work in Progress. 
 Forgot the attachment. Here it is. 
 Hi Felicia,  I would like to have one (1) AMEX gift certificate for $50.00 processed as soon as possible.  Thanks, Rod 
 What is the deal? 
 We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget. Tracy has the point on this one.  Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments? 
 Do you have the same for the income side? 
 FYI.   You got it! 
 Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC on that date, out of the office. 
 Ultimately more definition, but for now, it's a good start. 
 I'm fine. 
 I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so. 
 Brasher  Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory  These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on Dave.     What are your thoughts? 
 FYI 
 The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed. 
 Any idea on when I can get your info? 
 For Kathy:    How many have been submitted? 
 FYI.    This close date is of large significance to GPG as we are going to be asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the financials.     This variance from what we thought was a "Common Design" is a huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we could see had value.   I agreed to and "stacked hands" with all on the "Common Design", yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the "Common Design".   I just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my position on this issue. 
 FYI.     This was the detail provided to Sarabeth.

 What were the individual participation rates by entity?      Shirley Jo Wilson  12/12/2000 
 This is an FYI, but I think that Insurance probably fits into Jerry's world. 
 I can't make it.     I have another PRC to do. 
 Will he be having one the first tuesday of January, 1/2/01?     Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 I will have both Jim Saunders and Jerry Peters in attendance. 
 FYI 
 Approved. 
 Approved. 
 I haven't heard back from Rebecca on this, but I'm sure she is busy.   Do either of you care to answer my question below. 
 I didn't forget. 
 Do you still have the instructions for the wire to Compass Bank in the files?   I would like it wired there. 
 Here is the info: Bank:   Compass Bank Transit #: 113 010 547 Account #: 0600 1564 For credit to the account of Roderick J. and Kathleen R. Hayslett  Thanks.   I would like this done as soon as possible as I will be needing the funds at the end of the week. Rod Hayslett
