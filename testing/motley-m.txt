nd know that all will have a great time! Kate and I are going to CT and NY next week to find a place to live (hopefully). We are planning on renting initially then look to buy later. Real estate is crazy there. I guess it is not much better where you are though. Take care. Regards, Matt 
 Harvey, Hi. Hope things are going well for you in Europe. I was going through some old emails and ran across this one and thought I'd drop you a line. How is the family settling in and how is the job going? Things are fine here. I turned down a job with UBS and am waiting for my contract to expire. I will be glad when this whole Enron chapter is closed in my life. I'm sure everyone will. Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know how things are going for you. Take care. Regards, Matt
