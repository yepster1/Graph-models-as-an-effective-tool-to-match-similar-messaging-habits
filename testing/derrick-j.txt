 Mark, S&S is a quality firm, but in my experience it tends to be very expensive (as are most of the New York firms).  I do not know whether it has offices in Washington State or Kentucky.  We have not in recent years used S&S to a significant degree.  What other firms have you considered? Jim 
 I currently estimate that 11 individuals from Carrin's and my family will attend.  Jim
