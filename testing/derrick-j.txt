 Mark, thank you for the message.  Carrin and I returned safely; we very much enjoyed our dinner with the two of you and look forward to reciprocating in Houston.  In response to your questions:  (1) the GCs will meet in San Antonio beginning on the Wednesay morning of the conference.  There will be no scheduled GC dinner the night before, but those GCs who are in San Antonio that night may get together for an informal one; (2) I enjoyed meeting Marcus; my only question relates to the amount of legal experience he has; as you know, we normally take individuals who have been practicing longer than he has practiced; if you are satisfied that he can do the job well, I will support your recommendation; and (3) I do not have any issues with either of the law firms you mentioned. All the best. Jim

 Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and your firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a great team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All the best.  Jim 
 Gentlemen, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London (in connection with one of our mattters that was being heard by 5 of the Law Lords of the House of Lords) and found your message. I will coordinate travel plans with Bobby.  I am very honored to be included in this most memorable event. All the best.  Jim 
 Dalton, I have just returned to the office from a business trip to London of almost two weeks and found your messsage.  I think it would be very interesting to hear from Dr. Brenner.  All the best. Jim
