 I'll try to give you a call tomorrow 
 heard a rumor that EIX may file for bankruptcy on wednesday. 
 They do look tight.  But after a $2 drop, you'd have to expect it to pinch. Seems like, unless things really fall out of bed, this spread should widen from here.  Even if the front stays relatively unchanged.

 I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.  The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.  Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO position.
