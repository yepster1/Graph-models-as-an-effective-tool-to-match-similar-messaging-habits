o mention that we would be happy to discuss the interaction between eol and enymex.  if you talk to him soon, relay the same message.

 does this mean that on a volatility basis he thinks the options are attractively priced?  if so, i don't want him having any input to their pricing. 
 thanks for the help 
 Given what our announcement next week is going to look like,  do you think it is a good idea to issue some options to some key players soon after the announcement.  as sort of a down payment on bonus perhaps.  i think it would be best to keep it to a reasonably small group.  lets try to talk tomorrow and see if you have anyone we need to do this for. 
 we are bringing ebs into ews even if we don't change our reporting segments, so go ahead and pick them up. 
 Your guys need you.  I'm completely out of control!!!

 i would like to know the total number of trades, average number daily, total volume, and average daily volume for the second quarter
