I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.  Scott"  So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.  Hard to say whether it was good or bad for my mom.  But, honesty is the best policy, right?  Scott

 Well, sounds like everything is great in Germany!  You still didn't tell me about your trip to London?  I'm still doing just "ok".  The busier I am, the better I am, so I'm trying to keep as busy as possible.  If I wasn't poor and worried about my JOB right now, I'd schedule a trip to come see you, but I have to see how things shake out here.  I need to make some money quick!!!  And yesterday didn't help!  I need a vacation!!!  You guys MUST come stay with me at some point while you're here, and I wanna have a party one night while you're here.  Well, trading's getting busy....write back and I'll write more later!  Scott
