sun!  It's been pretty rainy and nasty here the last few days, but that's good for the yard.  Don't forget that my birthday is Friday!  I need a present from you!!!  hehehe  Scott 
 Sheila - there should be an offsetting deal to this #662479.  The net effect is that Vineyard should pay us the differential of $0.05 on 37,373 MMBtu or $1,868.65.  Scott 
 John -  Do you have a problem customer????  Scott 
 Yeah, I remember everything in London being VERY expensive!!!  But I had a great time there, I'm ready to go back!  I wanted to take Rayfael there this summer, but I doubt that will happen now.  It's starting to get pretty hot....hitting 90 now.  YUK.  I wish I'd started running sooner while it was cooler....I'm trying to get back to 140, and I'm 8 1/2 lbs from my goal.  I'm going to have to get buff now that I'm on the market again - and partially to make Rayfael think twice!!!  heheh  Oops...I started typing this email two hours ago and got too busy to finish...I'll send this now and write more later...

 Hey ---  FYI, Dan Junek quit today....he's going to Allegheny Power in NYC.  Thought you'd be interested to know.  Also, Kim's brother-in-law died this week.  They aren't exactly sure what the cause of death is yet.  So you may wanna contact her and give her your condolences.  Not much going on here, except I'm losing money hand over fist!!!  Talk to you later....  Scott

 Joann ---  Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and update it daily?  Scott 
 Molly,  I'd love to go
