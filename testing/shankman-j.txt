ect to morning reports for EGM. However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.  Thanks.  Jeff

 I want Platts, etc. to apologize and retract their story.  Jeff 
 Thanks for the email.  You do know that Networks and our Broadband businesses are different, I trust.  If you have and questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you get to the next group that most interests you.  Jeff 
 thanks for the update.  Please keep me updated today.....  Jeff    Enron North America Corp. 
 Why am I such a worrier.  It was fine...... 
 I really don't want to press release this.  Is there a good reason we should?  Jeff 
 Yes, I think we will both be there.  Do you have an idea of the number of attendees, (particularly from global markets)?  Jeff 
 am i around? 
 I've been swamped, and out of the office a lot the last several days.  Let's have dinner sometime, and I still have for you.    Alma Martinez/ENRON@enronXgate 02/23/2001 03:59 PM 
 please print text, and resume. 
 I'd like to have a few people meet her, but am confident in Jennifer's ability to evaluate analysts.  Jeff 
 Michelle, If you run into problems with finding mgr or above interviewers, you should consider assoc. to interview analysts.  I would also like to put Kevin McGowan (who went to MBA but isn't on the list, as an interviewer for wharton, in Phila if possible),  I'll leave it to you for interviewers. 
 Are you also coordinating this with hunter and his available analysts who you think are good? 
 Preliminary-- Anything suggestions?  Jeff 
 Sorry I missed you before I left--my phones at the house we also having some trouble. 
 Thanks, I'll get with Mike and let you know.  Jeff

 hey there.  freak show central here.  this week is bad, unfortunately. florida was awsome...and it put me in the mood to get back on the diet, and exercise.  did you buy that watch?  you should leave the office now and get it if you didn't, and on your way back, you should stop for a tennis lesson!    Alexandra Saler@EES 02/05/2001 09:09 AM 
 Draft:  We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets:  Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman.  Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.  Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives.  Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, Equity, and Agriculture initiatives.  (anything else?) 
 I'd like to talk to him, but isn't merlin's credit low?

 Print on my business letterhead.   Naomi Leff Naomi Leff & Associates 12 West 27th Street New York, NY  10001 212 686 6300  Dear Naomi,  Thanks for the opportunity to work with you on my new home.  I've enclosed a virtual tour disk (just follow the prompts), and some floor plans from my architect.  If there is anything else you need, please call anytime.  I'm excited for you to see the house in person, and have the chance to discover my passion for 20th century design.  Dennis and Daniel have been a great source of the best objects and knowledge.  Of course it is a primary concern to make sure the home, the objects, the furnishings, and the space work together.  Dennis and Daniel speak very highly of you and it is important to me that I have the help to complete this project with great attention, and all that results from that attention.  Best Regards,    Jeff 
 Hi Rick,  I understand it is hot in Dubai--hopefully it will cool off soon.  On an organizational matter, I'm not too comfortable with your creating new org charts, and creating a new exec committee, etc.  Please call me next week so we can discuss this.  Jeff 
 Supposed to be low 70's this evening, and cool tomorrow a.m.

 Please get with me before we offer a job to andrew mcclune.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 FYI 
 his response.  Jeff 
 Great article.  When/where will this be published.  Have a great weekend. Jeff 
 I may or may not be in town, but I think Mike will be here.  It's probably important that one of us attend.  Jeff 
 Thanks for your interest.  Mike and I have looked at cement a little, so I'm interested in your perspective.  Please contact my asst.  Jennifer Burns, at ext 39440 and get on my calendar.  Jeff 
 fyi....I'll set up a meeting with this guy. 
 come see me on hime and we'll talk strategy.  Jeff 
 If you'd like to go, that would be great.  Thanks.  Jeff    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 
 Hey, if no one has told you today that you are the king, let me be the one to do so.  Peace  Jeff

 sorry for the oversight on my part. 
 no problem 
 jeff 
 Please include Jen Fraser on this distribution as well going forward.  Jeff 
 Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  If you want to stay active in recruiting, let me know.  Also Michelle Nezi Marvin will be our shcool lead.  Best Regards  Jeff 
 Thanks for the email.  I'll put some thought into it.  Stay in touch--  Jeff 
 It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a good program?  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?  Jeff 
 If you'd like to get me the resumes today, I'll take a look, and pick a few out.  This way we won't need to change the meeting time.  Michelle was my first choice to lead the effort.  OK about Suzanne.  I'm serious about keeping a highly visible presence on campus, and am willing to spend some money, strategically.  Keep me updated.  Jeff 
 If you think there is value to your seeing the ship, I'm ok with your detour.  Let me know before you go what you intend to find out if anything.  Regards  Jeff    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 
 This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other. It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources.  I'm almost of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together.  Jeff 
 put on calendar 
 I will be out of the office oct 9.  Jeff 
 This looks like a great opportunity for us.  Jeff 
 Thanks for the invite.  I'd love to go with you guys.  Jeff    Michael J Beyer 02/05/2001 06:30 PM 
 what time is the soiree friday eve? 
 Jennifer Fraser is leading our fundamentals intranet group for all products within EGM.  Please contact her so we do not duplicate efforts, as the coal, etc site will be incorporated with some uniformity into the larger EGM site.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 please print 
 somewhat surprising, but we'll take it

 can you get per and jere o. an avistar system?  Thanks.  Jeff 
 I will be unable to attend  Jeff 
 fine if you keep me up to speed.  But I do not expect to does this for free. What do we want related to this?  Did you know Exmar exercised the options? Apparently they want to work with us--on this ship.  What do we want related to this? 
 here is the note I sent to Thor.  I'll wait for his response.  Jeff 
 its chris holmes, not harris.  is this something else? 
 put on calendar.  Thanks. 
 set some time up--30 minutes.  Jeff 
 Have you gotten with Chris Holmes, re: the voice mail I sent you end of last week?  Thanks.  Jeff 
 fyi 
 I've already talked to Cliff B.  The only thing we are precluded from is building a power plant in Singapore... 
 Very strong need for people in Japan next august.  I'd like to get some people interested in helping start there, or get there after some enron indoctrination.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 Yes, absolutely.  There is a ton of work in Japan, and as you know Joe Hirl runs the office, but the products in EGM are crucial to its success.  I'd be happy to meet her.  Let me know how I can help.  Jeff 
 Glad to be of help.  Let me know if you ever need anything from me.  Regards.  Jeff 
 let me know if you need my help.  I'd suggest leaving vince a voicemail....  Jeff 
 Hi Thor,  Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is never a bad thing. I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  Jeff

 Rick,  What is the network theory here?  I'm also not a fan of an only Jordanian play.  Politically, I'm not sure it makes sense, (like Gaza)  What's the benefit here?  Jeff 
 Clear it with arnold if you want dutch.  Let me know as people come to you. the goal is to have people rotate into your group directly, or from the gas fundamentals group if possible, and vice versa.  Keep me updated, and you, I and Lavo will work this out.  Jeff 
 He's in London, by the way.  Jeff    Joe Gold 02/05/2001 02:05 PM
