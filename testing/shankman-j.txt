it sounds like school is keeping you busy.  Let me know when you want to talk to my friend at Continental. I'm so tired from work--I'm going to watch a couple of movies tonight at home--the media room is all done with carpet, etc.  If you want to come over and watch movies and maybe eat that would be great.  Tomorrow I have friends in from out to town, a dinner on sunday for work, and I may be in London most of next week... 
 As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.  (In a nutshell, what can go where)  Can I get this ASAP?  Thanks  Jeff

 No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 7:30. So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts? I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong time.  When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square. 
 Thanks for the updates.  They are great.  I have a question about confirmation process.  How many votes in the Senate are needed to confirm. The Dems are saying they may try to indefinitely delay hearings on Ashcroft. How so?

 Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas markets, that can be extremely valuable...

 As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote aggressive ideas.  Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation. Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.   Jeff & Gary 
 Unsolicited from George.  FYI.  Jeff
