 I saw you called on the cell this a.m.  Sorry I missed you.  (I was in the shower).  I have had a shitty week--I suspect my silence (not only to you, but others) after our phone call is a result of the week.  I'm seeing Glen at 11:15....talk to you 
 got here around 9, hopefully leaving at 11.  I only did 8 abs last night. I'm going to get to 20 though....How was the play?  Haven't be to Zula....

 Can you find out if it was Johnny or Camille who sent me this resume, and for what group/job?    Jennifer Burns  12/13/2000 11:16 AM 
 FYI.  We also had Mckinsey  look at the soda ash market for us.  Not as compelling as we though, but interesting anyway...  Jeff 
 Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure it was fun, though.  Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message. I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN. (I have a party to go to sat eve for a little while) How's the day going?  Did you talk to Beth about Pinnacle? 
 Steel is not part of global markets, and if you could take it off this report, I'd appreciate it.  Also, Please add a section that shows new products as we add them to the portfolio.  Thanks.  Jeff    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please print following on letterhead:  Larry Kellner Chief Financial Officer (put rest here)  Dear Larry,  Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday. Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities. His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge research.  We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call.  It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier. Again thanks for your time.  Regards, 
 Great....Looking forward to it.  Jeff 
 get me a spot on the shuttle.  But I'll probably use a car service.  What time does this concert thing start, and can you get me all other directions, and info.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 I'll be out completely by Friday evening, and am finishing the list of workers who done various projects on the house, and will have that to you Friday as well via email.  I really appreciate your giving me the extra time....  Jeff 
 That glass of wine did the trick--I felt better  (more relaxed too!)  Dinner was boring--so I got home and had another glass of wine! 
 Hi Eric, hope you are well.  Do you know about this guy Nathan Hill that Clay Harris offered a job to work in dubai on dolphin?  Please let me know, he wants to get onl my calendar and hear about the LNG group, etc.  Jeff 
 Yes, Love to have dinner, either the 17th or 18th--you pick.  Let's have a drink at my house first so I can show you the digs.  Sorry I couldn't make it...last minute schedule problems...  Jeff 
 get with jennifer burns, my asst. and I'll say hello.  probably right after the crude mtg.... 
 Defcon 2?  I'm around until 4:30, and have an errand to go on, a cocktail party at 6 ish, and unkownd about dinner after that.  I'm around.... 
 No, he cannot come to the crude meeting, but I'd be happy for him to have a tour of the gas and crude floors and introduce him to some traders. 
 Your call on the bet.  I talked to my friend at Sat. Night Live, and she said no problem about being extras.  I'll get a list of scheduled hosts/bands--you pick!  (If that is still ok) 
 Hi Sarah,  What is your home address and work info....  Lots of hugs.... 
 Check into reservations.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 Any time you'd like to get here.  I'll be happy to set you up with a strong schedule. I'm glad you finally met Per.  He's been a little busy since I reorg'd the group and put him in charge.  Thanks for your patience, however.  Jeff    Nathaniel Jeppson <Njeppson@ALLENCO.COM> 02/14/2001 10:34 AM 
 Those dumb asses have now promised me my ab roller by tomorrow.  I explained to them our bet, and now they understand my problem...I WILL win... 
 How's it going?  Recovering from family OD? 
 Please also take a look at the resid curve/Pan Nat positions...Thanks. 
 So timely to receive your email today.  I was just thinking about you this past weekend, hoping everything was going well. 
 Please expect a call from Joe Hartsoe in the very near future.  His background lends itself to our businesses, and he is looking to add some commercial experience to his c.v.  Thanks for taking the time to meet with Joe.  Jeff 
 Great.  My asst is Jennifer Burns, at x39440 
 So the impaler might not have been too dramatic!  Have fun tonight! 
 How about Ali "the impaler" Saler?  Or is that too dramatic? 
 If I change my name to Mr  Crankman (for today only), I'll think of a name for you, too. 
 is this on the calendar? 
 Any pumping you can do would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Jeff    Joe Gold 02/23/2001 05:35 AM 
 Thanks for the email.  You make some good points. I'm still working with HR to address your bonus.  Thanks for your patience, but we'll get there.  Jeff    Niamh Clarke 02/14/2001 10:10 AM 
 When someone starts an email as you did, I think I have an idea of what you are going to say.

 Did you mean to send this to Rebecca Mark, or Rebecca Macdonald? 
 I would like to discontinue service entirely.  Thanks. 
 No issues, and this will benefit Enron company wide.  It will come out of either Kristie Patrick's (in Mark Palmer's office) or my budget.  Jeff 
 Your thoughts are dead on.  Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for EGM for crude and products.  Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.  Also, when we talk about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.  (We can also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)  Proceed, but I'm not sure about the JV with ENA issue.  Let's not go down that road "officially".  By the way, rough is spelled roof.  Later.....  Jeff    Per Sekse 02/14/2001 10:14 AM 
 Yes. 
 Sorry it's been so hard.  Nothing meant by it.  To where are you moving? 
 fyi 
 I will be in Phila.  Please grab materials for me. 
 Thanks for the email.  Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of Joe.  He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has added much value to our organization.  I was however a little surprised by your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.  I would have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.  In addition, I could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products. (Which I will remind you about frequently)  I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as well.  Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both respect your business sense.  As far as the guilt thing goes, I can't help you.  I'm Jewish and our people have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.  Jeff 
 Thanks. Will do.  Did you need something the other day?  Jeff 
 Gary,  That was a great presentation.  Thanks for the update. 
 WHERE are my macadamias?  Did you break the scales at the doctor?  Do you know how funny I am?  I'm finally leaving for the evening, and I'm so psyched to go home and play fetch with myself with the glow in the dark ball!  Have a great weekend if I don't talk to you during the hour I'll be here in the morn....  Hugs to Emma 
 what is this 
 I approve. Please process immediately.  Jeff 
 Great to hear from you.  Office number 713 853 1761.  Home 713 523 5077. Give a ring when you can, and I'll get you set up for the summer.  Jeff    "Daniel J. Fuller" <dfuller@Princeton.EDU> 02/14/2001 09:01 AM 
 Why did I just eat the largest fajita papasito's EVER made?   Put a few of those macadamias in interoffice mail, would you? 
 I'm picking out the carpet this weekend--so I'll also run out and get a picnic basket!  Your desert capabilities are impressive!  (Next time I'll get a quart of whipped cream instead of a pint so you can have twice as much, and I can win our contest)  You are a lot of fun--I like hanging out with you. 
 They are looking at trading advertising time.  Ed Ondarza may be the guy. I'd be happy to introduce you to him, if you'd like.  Jeff 
 You know, we've done something the last few tuesdays, and it is now my favorite day of the week!  I had a great time. 
 please set this up 
 Beth has not gotten with me. 
 I'm sorry, I need the glass presentation.  Jeff 
 I'd like to have my asst set up a phone call with you.  You really won't get the whole story in a short email.  Thanks...  Jeff 
 6:30 ish. 
 put this on the calendar.  I would likt to meet with them.  please let carrie know 
 I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre).  However, we have to look at our internal and external options.  If you look at the structure of  the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron.  In fact it appears to be quite one-sided.  First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne).  Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities.  Third, execute.  I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward.  Thanks.  Jeff    Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/14/2001 06:29 AM 
 Great.  I'm sure in the new organization you'll do extremely well.  Mike and I have a lot of faith in your abilities.  Jeff

 Was that you walking in this morn when I was?  How's everything? 
 nothing else to tell. 
 I'd love to fly dan down (at our expense) to have him meet some appropriate people.  Let him know he should call me to figure out the best  time to get him down here....have to go now though.......hugs    Jeff    halley k harrisburg <hkh@michaelrosenfeldglry.com> 02/13/2001 01:15 PM 
 I have McKinsey sending over another Glass Market presentation, and you should have it shortly....  Jeff 
 Hey, I'll be around this weekend, trying to get myself together.  I can't tell you how overwhelmed I've felt recently, and I think our conversation while I was awol (in NY for the day last weekend) really got to me.  I'll tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day. (The part where I'm NOT good at compartmentalizing).  I think that threw me for a loop too.  Oh, your message got to me this morn.  Please don't ever think you are bothering me.  I guess I'm a little less mature about my emotions than I thought.  (I know this is all personal, but email seems to be a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now).  I'm not sure that my home number is on yet, so the cell phone is where I'll be.  Thanks for checking up on me. 
 We are pleased to announce the following within EGM:  The Convertible Bond Arbitrage desk will be moving from EnronCredit.com to the Equity desk under Gary Hickerson, and will be managed by Mike Bradley. Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's unit as well.  He is exploring the agriculture value chain and outlining our risk management, (What else here?)  Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring our rail and trucking initiatives.  These markets together represent approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses.  In addition, we have asked (Pierre Aury to run our worldwide vessel trading businesses.  Scott Moncrief will be responsible for all liquids vessel businesses reporting to Pierre)  (should we mention cement here under george mclellan?)  Our worldwide weather operations will continue to report to Mark Tawney in Houston, and he will have all V@R  allocation responsibility between Sydney, Tokyo, Oslo, and Houston.  In addition we will be forming a weather marketing desk in London.  Janelle Scheuer will be joining the Global Products from Enron America's East power origination group, and is responsible for developing a mid-market business specifically for our liquids businesses.  She will be reporting to John Nowlan.  Bill White will be coming over from EBS and has responsiblity for all U.S. financial crude trading.  Don Schroeder will continue to have oversight of our physical crude business.  Anything else? 
 Let's get together and get this traders' roundtable going.  I propose:  You, me Lavo (if he's interested), Vince K, John Arnold, Phillip Allen, Mike Grigsby, (those three from US gas), Rogers Hearndon, and Fletch Sturm (East Power), Mike Bradley, John Nowlan,.  This list covers gas, power, crude/products, rates, and vince's economic views.  Any other people/groups/commodities we should have represented?  Jeff 
 How's it going?  I'm sure busy and great.  Good luck with the ice men--I still think you should cut something.  I'm excited to finish unpacking this weekend, and just relaxing a little.  If you're not completely wiped on sunday, give me a ring.  Oh, could you wear your new party pants tuesday to my house?  Great, thanks. Have fun!  Jeff 
 Please call him.  I'd be happy to spend time talking to them about the info below if that is what they want.  Jeff 
 Happy to help.  But I'm not sure for what you are asking.  Jeff 
 I just spoke with mike robertson and told him we are ready for a weather person in london now.  (I mean NOW)  He will coordinate with you.  Later  Jeff 
 Hi guys,  Shawn Cumberlan, the former head of the CALME region, is very interested in learning about the transportation businesses we are pursuing.  He will be in London end of next week or so and I'd like you guys to spend some time with him.  Dan, expect a call from him before he heads to London.  Mark Frevert is having him explore opportunities within the wholesale businesses.  Later,  Jeff 
 Also what about undergrads and taking them out to dinner? Etc.  Again,  Jeff    Jennifer Burns  12/01/2000 11:55 AM

 could you let Nicki know you are my asst, and this email should have come to you, not me. only 30 mins. 
 yes, now i can go after each trader.  also i had mentioned to peter (I believe)  that i wanted to see not only product offerings in egm, but also new products we add every week.  thanks.  jeff
