 I've only received one response to my inquiries into projects for Coleen.  John 
 Hey  Have you spoke to any of my folks yet?  If so what do you think.  John 
 John  I don't see Maggie's line on the P/L  Lavo 
 Hi  We are getting in several anylysts and associates  (new hires) in the next few months.  We also have interns coming for summer only.  Do you need any.  Can you use interns or does the training out weigh the benefits.  John 
 I would love to play 4 or 5 games.  Just got back into town.  John Lavorato 
 Tim  I still don't see and origination line on the reports.  Give me a call because I really want this to happen.  John 
 We need to talk for like 20 hours.  Let's schedule some time.  Lavo 
 What happened with Arcor.  Lavo 
 Vlady  You were supposed to pair me down at the top not the bottom  Laov 
 So I knew that you were going make some money last week off my positions but wow.  Just Kidding 
 Dave  I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.  The 8th to the 11th.  Tych and Calger are O.K. with this.  There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.  Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.  John  P.S.  Sorry for the confusion. 
 Although I haven't heard from Dave I'm trying to change my flights to March 8 - 11. 
 Rob  I'm very pleased about Petro.  Can send me the e-mail with the details.  I will forward it to the really big kids down here for you. 
 Derek  Your in on Pebble if you want.  Lavo. 
 yes 
 The east power traders have agreed to post their two ways on EOL for EES.  Janet, you might want to help speed up the administrative process.  It should be minimal effort. 
 Do we need any help on the Ontario front from Lay or Skilling.  Given the size of the stakes, I could definately justify their time. 
 Your Pan Nat summary was not clear enough to pass on to my supervisors.  Can you simplify it a little more.  Thanks  Lavo 
 Rob  I'm going to get on Ken Lay's schedule in the next couple of days(assuming he'll let me).  I'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit.  I'm concerned that hoards of people from Houston will show up and that it will be a cluster.  Can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals - p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal.  Also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my Ken meeting.  Write it in bullet point format and quite summarized. 
 Chris  On the California deal.  Can we possibly get the right to kill the deal 6 months from now if they do not get some credit support.  We may not exercise the option anyway, however, it would be nice to have especially if you could get it for free.  John. 
 There seems some confusion about the "AMPS" project.  This project continues to be an Enron North America project.

 Dave  When is the Gas Daily meeting.  I would like to attend.  I think I could help with the pitch. 
   Hi my name is Joooohhhn Lavorato from Tarona Canada.  How the hell are you guys? Where the hell are you guys?  Call me, I'm still an Enron hack.  713-853-7991

 I'm in Brazil returning that night.  You can decide if you can reschedule or not.  John sent me the index.  Get him to send it to you. 
 Wes  I'm away Monday and Tuesday in Brazil.  I thought I would give you things that I'm waiting on or that we should meet about next week.  1.  Your group was going to give back the assets/balance sheet stuff in 3 formats.  2.  On South America - Lot's of stuff but we'll talk when I get back.  Most importantly that I get an income statement that looks like North America.  -  They did a trade with me that's up 8 Million for them. This is fine but the negative p/l was not showing up in N.A.  The positive p/l was showing up in South America. (We should make sure this trade does not get cash settled.  The last thing I want is Cash going to S.A. on an internal trade.   3.  Cross Commodity Book. - I have 1.9 Million of losses that were last year that they found in January.  Put this in the TBG line and change the line name to Other .  In the Footnotes we will explain all others.  I'm sure there is a million things to come.  4.  We also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me.  5.  I've set up a meeting with you,me,Deffner and Louise on this 15% capital charge.  We should come up with another methodology.  That's all I can think of now.  John 
 Has an agreement been reached between South America and North America on the Turbine.  Or is North America waiting for final approval of its power plant 
 What happened to Dona Francisca. 
 Mark  You still own me you expected values for Pan Nat. 
 I've allowed one person to enter Enron America into Jacoby's group from Broadband.  We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.  I expect Louise or I to approve any employee who enters Enron America.  I will accept no exuses if someone slips in. 
 Wes  With respect to the PPA reserve.  We need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.  We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.  Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.  However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.  We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.  Lavo 
 Dave  I thought we were hiring 1 person from EBS not two.  William Abler was ranked as a strong director.  I will agree, but I hope the quality is as high as you think.  We are going to get tones of resumes from EES and EBS, if your going to blow all you bullets upfront, make sure your getting great people. 
 Some guy at Duke told Mark Frevert today that on March 15th, Duke won a court ruling saying that they expanded the scope of the PanNat Arbitration.  True? 
 Mark  We get a much different story from our appointed arbitrator for PAN NAT.  Although the main arbitrator did not do exactly what we wanted he had strong words to Duke that they had no support for their position.  We would like to ignore their pleas to settle because they have been making very unreasonable settlement offers. As we understand it arbitration starts July 1.  I'll talk to you more next week.  If you want an update prior call Richard Sanders.  John 
 Can I get an updated contract status report. 
 As you would say.  There is good news and bad news.  The good - we got the dining room chair.  The bad - it was an end/arm chair not a side chair.  Specifically it has two arms but the chair that broke has no arms.  Good Luck  John 
 test 
 Kim  Besides my chair - here is a list of stuff to chase down while I'm away.  Principal investing Miller owes me a hi - lo valuation of his investments and a meeting alone with him.  I thought that was going to be last week.  Set up the meeting for this week.  Set up the Oxley - Louise meeting is Friday moring, I need some time to prepare for it.  Car Phone  House Computer 
 Greg  I'm getting a million e-mails from my people about these committees.  The next time someone puts a bunch of my people on committees, do you think someone could seek my input.  Lavo 
 Has Ken Lay received a breifing binder yet? Can I get a copy soon?  Thanks John 
 Keeping to my reputation, I'll keep this brief.  You guys owe me 275 each for Pebble.  Since I owe Chris 310 for a flight and keeping it as easy as possible for me.  Dirk pays Chris 45 Dirk pays me 230  Thanks 
 Hi John  I think we should kill the concept of cross calibrating analysts and associates accross business units.  I think this is a waste of time.  We can include them in our business unit PRC's for Managers and Directors.  Any comments.

 Recession, What Recession.  Barton Creek was full the weekend of the 20th and 21st.  Dorie managed to get me a room.  However, the Golf times were non existant so I figured I would play it by ear and try to book later.  If you and Donna want to join us feel free.  The next weekend the 27th and 28th is the weekend that I may go to Vegas.  I may also stay and play lots of Golf here.  Let me know your thoughts.  Lavo 
 Please let Kim Hillis (my assistant) know about all the EES meetings planned for this week.  I'm going to try to attend. 
 Andy  With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.  John 
 I couldn't meet with Joon due to PG&E on Friday.  His resume looks good and assuming everyone else likes him, we should hire him.  I assume that this is for associate or is it for associate in the trading tract.  Let me know.  Make sure we get a 3 month evergreen non compete.  Lavo 
 Ben I need you to sell the Canadian Turbines.  Call me.  Lavo 
 Ben  They haven't sold them for a year.  I think that we can wait until you get back.

 Joe  Greg Whalley wants to know about all our current dealing with Petrobras.  Please e-mail him something today.  Thanks  John 
 I asked everyone for their A/A needs and received very little feedback.  Please respond promptly.   Thanks  John 
 Rick  Rob Milnthorp have been discussing whether we want to look for a new regulatory person in Toronto.  We are leaning towards starting with a new face.  Give me a call to discuss.  John 
 I don't want to talk to you.  Talk to Tim and Kevin. 
 Dave  This is the format I want.  Can you have someone check the data and then print and deliver a color copy to me and Louise today.  And then update it every week over the next month as we try to finish this process. 
 Linda  Is was nice meeting you at the pro-am.  I hope you had as much fun as I did.  Can you pass my phone number and email address to Rob Davis.  John Lavorato Lavorato@enron.com 7138537991  Thanks 
 first i heard about this. 
 Let's just leave the prudency stuff unhedged for now. 
 Can we get more critical mass.  Our Portland guys, ie Wolfe, might have some Montana counterparts. 
 Jeff  I went home today sick.  But I'll try in the future. 
 Your continuing to kill me.  Is that how you spell continuing. 
 Yes 
 It would be helpful to our corporation if you would try to hire some of your staff from places other than Enron North America.  Thanks  John

 We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.  Lavo

 Great!!!! 
 Hello everyone.  In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.  I would like suggestions as to:  1)  Where to go.  2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.  3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.  4)  And any other ideas you have.  In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.  Regards  John

 Great!!! 
  Were you a guest speaker? 
 We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.  Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.  Please respond prompty,   John 
 Boy does this sound like something that would get fucked up.  Start with Paul Devries in Toronto and let me know what happens.  I didn't even know it was closing. 
 I was all set to send the press release to my mother and then I saw Louise's name.

  Greg  Our Copel shares are falling in value.  We have never marked this investment even though it is public.  We currently own ADR's - ELP is the ticker.  We are restricted (i think) in selling until July.  At the current price we would lose 15 to 30 Million. 
 YOUR CALL, JUST DO IT QUICK 
 Is the Geresul contract done. 
 We don't need the currency or mmbtu/gj conversion language if Gas Daily agrees to what we want. 
 From the Gas and Power side, we wouldn't need any traders in Montreal, but perhaps some marketers.  Paul Devries in Toronto runs our Eastern Canada operation if you would like to talk to him.  John

 I told you that Pope and Milly wouldn't last.

 Accounting lists the high prob. q2 deals for my budget meeting with Whalley.  Currently you have one deal on it that is DWR and it says 10 Million. Could you please make sure the commication with Accounting is taking place. John 
 Maybe you can have a diesal position.  If you can justify it to me and Rick Buy.  Talk to Shankman and see who in his organization runs that product. 
 I'm not sure that we have enough candidates to bother.

 I don't care as long as I see them 
 rams -3.5 wash -7 raiders -9 1/2 balt -5 bears lions over 37 eagles bengals under 35 1/2 pats +4 vikings +5.5 
 I guess they have signed quite a few deals. 
 On separate sheets. 
 I don't need to see him. 
 We should have room on 6.  Check and see if Arnold has redone the floor plan.  You need to keep this away from Fred's group.  I would suggest locating near Gas Structuring.  Ed McMichael, the head of gas structuring can be a big help. 
 talk to Don on the EES stuff 
 It's more related to the size of this transaction and the fact that the transport model apparently doesn't calc var.  I have no fundamental concerns but this one hit me from left field.  On our other issue, I working on getting something in front of you this week. 
 ok 
 ok 
  Kim can you set up a phone interview with this guy next week. 
 those were all 250 
 Just use mids on the day they were pulled. 
 Stacey  Assuming this P/L is going to stay at 0, get the line item off the DPR. 
 Just go ahead and talk to Dave about the other industries. 
 My thoughts are the same.  You should stay in Canterra.  We can squeeze way more desks on that floor and I'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years.  Given the experience with the walls I would stick to your day job.  Lavo 
 Your employees will be upset to leave Canterra.  Lavo

 IGNORE FRANK. I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TRADING POWER RIGHT NOW BUT THAT MIGHT CHANGE SOON. 
 I wasn't aware of schedule B. What is it. 
  Kim  Print this out for my trip. 
 Jeff  Sorry it took so long to respond.  I talked to our EOL guys and they keep this stuff very close to their vest.  People are talking to us about buying the code but this would cost tens of millions of dollars.  So I don't think I can help.  Sorry  John 
 Neil I got the resumes.  Come and see me.

 I would like to do a phone interview and then I will bring him in if I like him.  Send me a resume and then I'll set him up. 
 I look forward to the updated supply demand analysis.  John 
 Rob  What's the deal on Deregulation in Ontario. 
 Just let me know how I can help. 
  This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.

 Dave  Oxley is coming.  Me you and Ox on Friday.  Tych joins us on Friday.  The golf reservations are below.  Me and you share rooms at the Bellaggio and Tych and Ox need to sort their rooms out.  We'll leave anytime you want on Thursday afternoon.  Earlier the better of course.  John 
 Done 7:20 at the Houstonian.  See you there. 
 I met with Shea in Houston.  Didn't broach the issue on working in Canada for us.  He always puts on a good face about TC but I'm not sure he loves it.  Until recently I was happy with Lambie.  Call me.  We should think about it. 
 it wasn't outrageous.  Call me if he is interested and we will talk about dollars.  Because he will be a VP candidate he will have to interview in Houston. 
  I take back my dog comment.  john

 Set up a time with Mike. 
 I would love to meet with you and I'm sure Louise would too.  I would also like to take you to dinner.  Let me know. 
 Bob,  Please increase Kim Hillis' (my assistant) email file.  Kim often receives mail files on my behalf and needs the additional space to receive this mail. 
 Clay  How did you calc the w2 amount of 487,856.  I assume this is the portion of the stock option exerecise that occured after I moved.  If so can I get the calculation for my records.  John 
 I think we are going to pass. 
  I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to interview Greg Shea.  I've known Greg for a long time and tried to hire him on several occasions.  Jon McKay has indicated that he would like to return to Houston for personal reasons later this year and we will need more senior talent in Calgary.  John 
 its sounds like cats are no longer sleeping with dogs and the world is starting to make sense again. 
 What is this? 
 Can't make it.  Thanks anyway. 
 No Problem  Lavo 
 Kim  Can you set up the meeting with my people that John Sherriff requires. 
 Ed  I think Dave talked to you about this deal.  Can you get on my schedule tommorow to discuss the process for all these deals.  John 
 Milly  This looks good especially if you get Harris.  What do they want me to be part of if anything.  I was assuming the Breakfast and the Lunch and hopefully the meeting with Harris. Can you let me know so I can set up my schedule. I would like to go see the Toronto office and also get some personal time in.  Thanks  John 
 Thanks for your help on this. 
 We absolutely should do this.  We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.  There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.  PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp  Brooklyn Union  Peoples - Laura Luce  Enerconnect - Devries  My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid. 
 Just talked to Shapiro.  He wants Lay, Alex and me in the meeting.  I of course was fighting Alex.  I'm okay with Lay meeting other people while he is in town.  Shapiro said he would get Alex working on the talking points.  You and Devries should spend time on them before they come to me. 
 How's that for VAR management.  Lavo 
 This is pretty sensitive stuff.  We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.  I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it. 
 Kim  Same deal as the legal memo stuff. 
 Wayne  If Michael Moutlon wishes to pay for this I'm O.K. with it.  The memory business was never sponsored by North America.  Please get Michael to send me an e-mail acknowleding that he well pay.  Thanks  John 
 You should use 30 c1 with that many people. 
 Wait until Louise gets back.  These should not be big.  ie 50 and 125 at most.  I'm not even sure that Irvine is the right guy in the end. 
 No one needed for the PRC.  Jaime Williams and Steve Irwin are co leads. 
 NO 
 Tim  -  It doesn't need to hit the dpr. -  Mike's job is not to respond to rfp's -  If this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year - which is another problem -  Finally, I could of paid Mike half of what I paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat. He needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business.  We're not trying to build Stat Oil here. -  If we don't reward our originators properly, we won't have any.  Having said all that.  If your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid, maybe that's the best answer.  Call me. 
 Do not book anything related to Arcor until I say so. 
 Thanks  Aint Technology great. 
 Tych  Can you look into this.  Don't waste too much time on it.

 Can you get me Julie's presentation.  I'm in Toronto on April 4th and may be able to come to N.Y. However I would want to know how many meeting you would want me to attend and the message you would want sent if any.  Unfortunately, my time is unbelievably tight.  I can't assure you yet that I can make it, but I would like to try. 
 This could be very dangerous.  OPG controls all the megawatts.  They could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it.  If you could use British energy and get some deal done with OPG to hedge us maybe we would for a few months. 
 Or did he leave me with the 2 Billion budget to get a 30 Million Budget.  Lavo
