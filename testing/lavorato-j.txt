 Beth  Do a very short bullet presentation on the key focus for 2001 systems and leave lots of time for everyone to grill you (I mean ask questions).

 Yes dear 
 Isn't this our world.  John 
 I'm interested in the Carrabean not just Jamaica but the primary focus is an upscale place that caters to young children.

 Someone internal is coming to look at it this weekend.  I posted it at 15500. 
 Greg  Have a great time with the $100 Million Club  Lavo and Dave 
 Have we rented our office space yet. 
 Fred  Can you please take care of this.  John 
 Seems like a fair trade  Lavo. 
 Kim make sure you brief me about this on Monday,  John 
 Dave give me a call. Some of the data looks odd.  Also It seems that old reports still have Arnolds future contract included.  John 
 Rich  Some of the traders interviewed Key on Friday and unfortunately he didn't perform very well.  I think we are going to have to pass on him.  Thanks for the cooperation. 
 No  I think Forster has me covered.  Lavo 
 My vote is to kill it. 
 Chris  Is it true that we get the info first from the AGA, 
 Julie  I'm looking into this. 
 Mark  Still waiting for my car keys.  In the package you can include the $11.25 you owe us for interesting movie you bought on the 3rd suite in the Lavorato household.  Lavo 
 Milly it looks like your head of parking and you may need to lease our office space too. 
 Bruce  I had quite a crazy week.  Give me a call the next time you are in town or if you are still in town.  I would love to get together.  John 
 Kevin  Has Dave called you on this or do I need to do something. 
 Dave  I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.  Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the futures trades.  Thanks 
 Kim  Did you ever get hold of my accountant?

 Angela  Please reschedule my lunch with Dan Fornier at Blakes for next week. 
 Rob, that's good information, keep digging. 
 ssss 
 Tammy  Come and see me first thing.  The gas section is way long and complicated. 
 I would like to request an additional 15 million var for gas.  Prices have exploded and I'm working on it. 
 I don't know why this is coming up now and why we don't address this at year end in conjunction with the PRC process.

 Can set up a conference call with me and Remi Cologne in Brazil this week. Also, what happen to Manu. 
 Can you please print me 20 color copies of these reports just this week.  I want to distribute them to me head traders. 
 Dan  I'm leaving for a couple of weeks.  I'll get you my computer when I come back.  John

 Send me stuff on Wolfe's performance this year and where you would rank him. I need this for tomorrow. 
 I need trader performance by Var for everyone you have in the company  by 8:00 AM tommorrow morning. 
 Let's grab another 15 minutes together before you do anymore work,  John  Tuesday may work -  check with Kim Hilis. 
 NGX owes us a lot of money on Deceber 25th.  Please send me an  email when we receive it.  Thanks  John 
 Dave  I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.  He has Per on the road working on it.  We probable should tell him that we don't have anymore unless New Albany is enough. 
 Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.  John 
 That would be outsanding. 
 Charlene  My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire. I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on International business.  Regards  John 
 Wes  Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas Association).  The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.  But I wonder if some of our other piplelines are members. 
 Bill.  I've taken a look at your resume and pulled your internal reviews.  We have decided to go another route.  Sorry.  I'll be in Houston for the next three weeks if you want to talk to me.  John. 
 Vince where did this resume come from and is he still employed by the National Bank in Monteal. 
 Anthony  Thanks for the email, however, that was the last thing that I received.  I think some credit intermediation would be helpful. 
 Print all these resumes for me. 
 Kim  Please print all these resumes for me. 
 Can't seem to find this.  John 
 Hickerson always claims that they have var by trader. 
 sounds good tim 
 We lost 1/2 of the money on our west basis positions. We lost the other 1/2 on fixed price length. 
 I have no interest in this person.  John 
 The loss was due to rest of month Transco Zone 6 basis. 
 I don't know him that well, however, I don't think he is a superstar.  Rob Milnthorp in Calgary might have a better read. 
 Kim  Please let this person know to send you this e-mail not me. 
 I have no interest in these two employees. 
 Tim  If at all possible I would like us to pass on talking publicly about this topic.  John 
 I take it back, I am familiar and I think you guys did a great job getting this done with them.  This is a great first step in our ultimate goal. 
 For the seven names that were not on the spreadsheet.  Can you fill in all info like the others for them including who they work for and get it back to me promtly.  Thanks  John' 
 Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year. 
 I thought I was very clear that we are not publishing anything internally about California gas prices. 
 The pain will stop soon. 
 I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week. Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  Let me know  John 
 Thanks 
 Your the King. 
 Despite my veto eBiz decided to publish something on California energy prices.  I think Palmer overrulled me.  He said that the article was harmless but I still think it is stupid for us to be writing articles about this.  John

 Jeff  Increase the amount we put into prudency for Friday to 130 Million. 
 Kim can you also invite Mike Roberts. 
 Kevin  Can you get our new reports- ie. off peak prices and positions and heat rates put on the executive viewer.  Thanks  Lavo

 Kim  Can you print these in color. 
 Can we take one of your wonderchildren in fundementals and let them spend 1-2 hours a day on VAR.  If yes, talk to Frank. 
 I'm a bachelor next week and would love to go to dinner.  Anywhere you want. John 
 No interest 
 Does EES still get to buy PC's for their employees' spouses.  I guess we are paying for that too. 
 Did you notice emmissions trading made 6 Million this quarter.  Glad we could help. 
 Stinson  Thanks  P.S.  At the end of the term of each simulation do we assume that we close the position on that date and take a hit or do we leave the simulation with an open positon. 
 Kim  Can you print me two copies in color.  John 
 Lets grap 5 minutes on this  John 
 These assumptions are correct for now. 
 Per  Give me a call in January on this.  John  P.S.  Happy Holidays. 
 FYI 
 Try to grab me today on this stuff.  John 
 Dave  Should we invite Presto and Beldon to this meeting.  I think so. 
 Sally  We need to talk about the 26th. 
 Rick  Can we keep the current VAR until close of Business December 27th. 
 Please Print. 
 Patience is a virtue.  East Power has hire several traders in a rush.  There down in aggregate 15 Million.  I have a very qualified individual coming in to interview in early January. I will put you on the schedule.  Merry Christmas  John

 thanks h 
 I would like to do a phone interview and then I will bring him in if I like him.  Send me a resume and then I'll set him up. 
 i talked to him last week and we are going to schedule something for next week. 
 its sounds like cats are no longer sleeping with dogs and the world is starting to make sense again. 
 How's that for VAR management.  Lavo 
 I'm working on it.

 Janet  Communication is always a problem around here.  I have no problem with you having access to all pricing reports and origination schedules. 
 Do we need to talk about VP and MD nominations. 
 Probably a fraud get the id #'s!  k 
 Tim  I assume you know that you have to make a presentation at the offsite.  Can you send me a copy by Monday.  If not let me know.  Thanks John 
 Charlene,  Thank you for the invitiation, however, I wanted to let you know that John is currently scheduled to be out of the country on January 11.  I have added it to his schedule incase his plans change.  Kim 
 yes  I have a time on Sunday and the rates are down to 95 at the Houstonian.  Let me know. 
 Call me on Saturday 713-661-6096

 I will not accept Amerex having the ability to execute over the phone.  Take this out of the deal or kill the deal.  John 
 Jim  This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead for a long time if not for good.  Regards,  John  P.S.  I'll call you soon on are project, currently on hold until 2001 if we decide to build in Ontario. 
 Kevin  I assume you know that you need a presentation for next week's offsite.  Can I see a copy ahead of time.  Thanks  John Lavorato 
 Rob  Give me a call sometime about this trade. 
 I have no interest.  Thanks 
 I want all the extra VAR you can give me for the next few weeks.  Please let me know if and how much that is.  Regards  John 
 I'm a strong yes on these issues. 
 So I didn't violate yesterday. 
 Bob keeps trying to stack and roll his date for leaving.  Don't let him.  John 
 Mike  I'm coming down this week.  We'll talk about it then.  John 
 At some point when you less busy, I would like you to look into one of the Compressor service deals. 
 John said yes - call me if you have questions.  k 
 Please move the names_jlavora.nsf and jorunal_jlavora.nsf files to the appropriate locations on his mail server (nahou-lnmai16).  You can either hit me on the Nextel (56517)  or page me (713-327-9348) when this is ready, so I can complete his iPAQ installation.  Thanks -Mike Hernandez 
 Dave  I'm thinking of hiring Kim Hillis.  I would like your opinion.  Lavo  713-853-7991 
 yes  I will follow up.  Lavo 
 Quick someone call Owen. 
 I'm getting closer.  Can you resend me the initial memo. 
 I just read this email now.  It might be too late.

 Add Wes to these notes.  Thanks John 
 Kelly  Unfortunately Enron moved me to Houston.  I will not be able to participate in Enviros this year.  Regards  John Lavorato 
 Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan under the following  conditions.  1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.  2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,  3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.  4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not keeping.  Give me a call if there are any issues. 
 I've got my financing covered.  Cash and Enron.  However I did enjoy the e-mail.  Regards  Lavo 
 If we post Canada Power, post Canada Gas. 
 It's fine.  We don't need to meet. 
 Contact Rob Milnthorp and tell him that I strongly recommend that he give a donation.  Also, Rob might be a great addition to your team.  John 
 This is what we executed yesterday, 
 That's why we love you. 
 Vlady  Don't change correlations until we discuss.  Lavo 
 Is there anything in my current role that I won't have to champion. 
 Billy  We need to hedge funds. 
 Orlando  On Ed Graham.  I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.  Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the issue after I talked to them.  They have decided to give him 6 months to perform or he will be let go.  His bonus for 2000 will be 0.  I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.  John 
 Mike,  Tonight John and I are going to be migrated to Outlook.  Please note that John has a laptop computer that is at his home.  I have spoken with Randy about this and he is to be following up with you.  I would like for you to accompany Greg out to the Lavorato home to complete the migration on to his computer.  Also, please note that I gave my and John's passwords to a lady that stopped by my desk today (she is with the migration group).  Could you please confirm for me tomorrow that they have been shreaded.  Thanks  k 
 Were not hiring him 
 The reason I called you today is to tell you that I noticed your EOL performance.  Not bad for a cunuck. 
 Shank  It seems that Bradford still feels that we are commercially objecting to some credit mitigation.  Can you talk to him,  Thanks Lavo  P.S.  Great job of minimizing the p/l hit late last week. 
 Howard  Can you remove me from this distribution list - my life is a little complicated. 
 1.  I didn't know much about ag products but Ted Murphy is trying to include me in the loop.  2. Chris Calger says that he has aggregated his CPI positions for the west. Can check if Dave Duran has done this for the east and try to aggregate the position.  If you need help let me know.  John 
 Tim  Can you get someone (perhaps a marketer) to give me a one pager on the WAPA deal. 
 Mark  Send me an e-mail decribing how the quote process went.  If you need my help let me know. 
 Angela.  How is Thursday the 16th of May.  Call me John. 713-853-7991 
 Yes Thursday may 18th. 
 Chris,  I'll figure this out,  Please stop sending me this email. 
 I just sent an email to Chris telling him to stop sending me this email.  I guess he needs to send it. 
 GOOD 
 I think the list is OK.  Can you fedex me one of the deal entry books. 
 Ignore Shankman - I think that was a bit of joke. 
 THIS IS NO JOKE PLEASE SENDTHIS TO ALL OF CALGARY.  THANKS ANGELA   TODAY IS NATIONAL FUN DAY AT WORK (so get to work!)  THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK!   JOHN LAVORATO 
 aPPROVED 
 Jon  Ignore expenses.  We just split the whole office in half to split the trading and marketing.  You are also not authorized to see some of those expenses. So please ignore them. 
 Approved 
 I assume your working on this.  You owe me on the web page.  1.  Pricing - Lon's sheet.  2. Power Sheets  3. Peggy's volume and number of trades sheet. 
 Milly .  If you're going to sell the warrants yourself. (It sounds like you should if your getting $2 in time value) let me know and I'll call off the equity group. 
 Call me on Beau.  A couple thoughts.  If they are so screwed why can't we get a couple million in fees.  Also, remember that the Canadian commericial group wears the debt not the credit group. 
 The genco was rolled into the East Trading.  Can we get rid of the Genco on the DPR. 
 Tim  Please add bookrunners names beside the books on your P/L. 
 Mark  Can you have one of your lawyers get me a copy of the Merryl Lynch deal we deal at the end of last year.  A short summary to supplement the contract would be great.  Thanks  John 
 APPROVED 
 approved 
 Kevin  I agree.  If we ultimately trade out of Toronto, the P/L responsibility will probably role into you.  It looks like we were trying to close Garret Tripp (Associate) to move to Toronto and start looking at this stuff.  If he is going, you should meet with him before he goes. 
 Can you please get a copy to my assistant Kim Hillis to put into my binder.
