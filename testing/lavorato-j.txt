Lavorato 
 Your getting way to complicated.   This product may not trade much and until it does we can do most things manually. 
 Chris  I know I have to sign this stuff. I don't think I need the e-mails. 
 Please do not send me these charts. 
 ssss 
 Looks good to me. 
 Dave  It sounds like the urgency on the Wind Power decision wasn't a reality. Kevin says that they are working on it.  If you need me to do anything let me know.  Lavo 
 Dennis  Thanks for your memo outlining your positions and strategies.  It was very helpful for me to understand your thought process which seems very sound.  I hope to spend more time with you guys in the future.  I am also working on the human resource issues you mentioned.  John Lavorato. 
 How is our internal trading of PJM demand going. 
 Rob  Just to clear on our conversation.  I'm fine with the Sunoco transaction. 
 Rick  I wasn't double counting.  My 5 Million was the Cross commodity group.  I'm fine with your comments re. Sherriff. 
 We're back baby. 
 This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.  With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:  1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).  2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).  3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the "Cross Commodity Trading Group" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to start us down this path.  Please let me know what you think.  John 
 Please excuse Kim Hillis and Kay Chapman from SAP timekeeping class and provide them with the necessary tools to learn this at their desks.  I understand that with this dismissal that they will be required to learn it on their own.  Kim Hillis is currently registered for the class on Thursday, June 29 and Kay Chapman had Beverly Stephens attend on her behalf.  Please provide them with a contact name in the event that they have any questions. 
 Kori,  John is out of the office today.  I will convey your message to him when he phones.  If there are any changes, I will alert you.  Have a great day and wonderful weekend.  Kim 
 I have no interest in these two employees. 
 that was for chiefs and newengland.  just to be clear. 
 I think we should restrict Peter's memo's to 50 words or less.  Please advise.  Lavo. 
 Lavorato Self Evaluation/Accomplishments  I'm just simply better than everyone else. 
 Kim  No more salary changes without my approval. 
 Ron  Thanks for your help with my house purchase.  Please forwad an bill to me at Enron (location eb3324). 
 The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit today.  This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market. This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a performance measurement standpoint.  Now that the curves are corrected I expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following ways:  1.  Understanding the fundamentals. 2.  Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast. 3.  Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker. 4.  Developing new traders.  Thanks  John 
 All of a sudden Mark Frevert asks me everyday about when we'll know about hedging re PPA's and if we can delay the auction 2 weeks.  The dream is still alive.  Let's see my boys come through.  Lavo 
 Jane,  I have printed off these forms, had John sign the employee one and have passed this information on to Dave Delainey.  After receiving the information, please let me know if you have any questions or require any additional information.  Thanks  Kim Hillis x30681 
 Jeff  Can you set up a meetin with you and your desk heads and me for 1 hour this week to talk about EOL and product offerings. 
 current 6300  over 39 1/2 400 
 Give me a call. 
 Dave  I wouldn't mind waiting a few weeks to go to Portland.  PRC is going to eat up a lot of time in the next few weeks and it would be nice if Mike Swerzman was in town when we went.  However, whatever you want "I will follow"(U2).  Lavo 
 Jane  Sorry I was very busy last week.  The ammendment is no rush.  I will call you when I get a chance.  John 
 TIM  Now that we have so much time on our hands.......Please send me a list of products, terms and bid/offer spreads that we can negotiate for EOL. 
 Laurie  As Discussed. 
 Dave  The PPA schedule was pushed back two weeks.  I would like to keep our meeting with Skilling because I heard he was going to Africa for 3 weeks.  Lavo 
 I have contacted HR and the changes were made on Friday.  Please make sure that the system reflects John Lavorato's Houston number and that his Canada number is not dialed.  Call me if you have questions at 713-853-0681.  Kim Hillis    Tycie Magee  06/09/2000 04:03 PM 
 Some of you had trouble opening the Mgmt Summary previously sent.  You should be able to open this one.  There were no changes to the numbers. 
 Sure 
 Dave  I was told that I was changed over on June 1st.  Please make sure it is June 15th or I have tax problems.  Lavo 
 Shiela,  Just following up to my call to you, if you could please provide any documentation to John in an envelope prior to the Monday meeting, I would appreciate it.  Also, could you please add me to your distribution list?  Thank you for all your efforts.  Kim Hillis x30681

 If Beth is our Systems person why is she in London.  Lavo

 Call me when you get back. 
 I need you guys to confirm that you are available June 3rd (Saturday) for the ENA super saturday.  P.S.  you need to say yes.

 Donald,  Could you please include my name on the distribution of this report?  Thanks  Kimberly Hillis 713-853-0681 
 Sure thing!  I will give it to her in the morning.  k     Susan Skarness @ ECT 05/22/2000 06:31 PM 
 Susan,  I have $50 for you from John.  Would you like for me to have it delivered to you or would you like to come by and pick it up?  If you would like it delivered, please let me know what your new EB location is.  Thanks  Kim Hillis x30681     Susan Skarness @ ECT 05/16/2000 08:06 AM

 Can you please get a copy to my assistant Kim Hillis to put into my binder. 
 Kevin  I agree.  If we ultimately trade out of Toronto, the P/L responsibility will probably role into you.  It looks like we were trying to close Garret Tripp (Associate) to move to Toronto and start looking at this stuff.  If he is going, you should meet with him before he goes. 
 approved 
 Mark  Can you have one of your lawyers get me a copy of the Merryl Lynch deal we deal at the end of last year.  A short summary to supplement the contract would be great.  Thanks  John 
 Tim  Please add bookrunners names beside the books on your P/L. 
 The genco was rolled into the East Trading.  Can we get rid of the Genco on the DPR. 
 Call me on Beau.  A couple thoughts.  If they are so screwed why can't we get a couple million in fees.  Also, remember that the Canadian commericial group wears the debt not the credit group. 
 Kim  Did you ever get hold of my accountant? 
 Milly .  If you're going to sell the warrants yourself. (It sounds like you should if your getting $2 in time value) let me know and I'll call off the equity group. 
 I assume your working on this.  You owe me on the web page.  1.  Pricing - Lon's sheet.  2. Power Sheets  3. Peggy's volume and number of trades sheet. 
 Jon  Ignore expenses.  We just split the whole office in half to split the trading and marketing.  You are also not authorized to see some of those expenses. So please ignore them. 
 aPPROVED 
 Ignore Shankman - I think that was a bit of joke. 
 I think the list is OK.  Can you fedex me one of the deal entry books. 
 GOOD 
 Dave  I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.  Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the futures trades.  Thanks 
 I just sent an email to Chris telling him to stop sending me this email.  I guess he needs to send it. 
 Chris,  I'll figure this out,  Please stop sending me this email. 
 Yes Thursday may 18th. 
 Angela.  How is Thursday the 16th of May.  Call me John. 713-853-7991 
 Mark  Send me an e-mail decribing how the quote process went.  If you need my help let me know. 
 Tim  Can you get someone (perhaps a marketer) to give me a one pager on the WAPA deal. 
 1.  I didn't know much about ag products but Ted Murphy is trying to include me in the loop.  2. Chris Calger says that he has aggregated his CPI positions for the west. Can check if Dave Duran has done this for the east and try to aggregate the position.  If you need help let me know.  John 
 Howard  Can you remove me from this distribution list - my life is a little complicated. 
 Shank  It seems that Bradford still feels that we are commercially objecting to some credit mitigation.  Can you talk to him,  Thanks Lavo  P.S.  Great job of minimizing the p/l hit late last week. 
 Kevin  Has Dave called you on this or do I need to do something. 
 The reason I called you today is to tell you that I noticed your EOL performance.  Not bad for a cunuck. 
 Is there anything in my current role that I won't have to champion. 
 Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan under the following  conditions.  1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.  2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,  3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.  4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not keeping.  Give me a call if there are any issues. 
 Dave  I'm thinking of hiring Kim Hillis.  I would like your opinion.  Lavo  713-853-7991 
 Kevin  I assume you know that you need a presentation for next week's offsite.  Can I see a copy ahead of time.  Thanks  John Lavorato 
 Tim  I assume you know that you have to make a presentation at the offsite.  Can you send me a copy by Monday.  If not let me know.  Thanks John 
 Jane  I finished my reseme and most of the form you gave me.  The only thing I'm currently missing
