Enron stock and stock options! 
 This is a test to see if you receive this email.  Good luck! 
 Do you want to meet for lunch Wednesday?  Then spend the night, or at least until you have to leave?  WE can hot tub! 
 Sorry I have been out of the office on vacation and business.  I'll call Basler ASAP.  What about you, what's up? 
 I was meaning for you to come down Wednesday night.  I have lunch plans already, sorry.  Is that ok? 
 Hey, where are you?  Did you get my last email?  Paul 
 I was wondering where you were.  I've got tickets to the Broncos' game on Sunday, would you want to go?  Also, I need to get back to working on buying gas delivered off the Jonah system, so can we talk about delivery points and rates? 
 Hey what are you up to today?  Are you still planning on meeting me for dinner?  Paul 
 Yeah Baby, that hits the spot! 
 I'm looking forward to it also.  I may not do the ski training class tonight, I'm worried about my ankle.  So, if I don't I'll be ready around 6:30.  I'll keep you posted.  Let's talk later. 
 When you get a chance call me. 
 What you had a birthday without telling me about the party!  What did you do?  What are you guys doing for Halloween? 
 Dear Abby says; call her, hunt her down!  If you don't want her I'll take her or at least I'll take her after you. 
 The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.  Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!  Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see! 
 I promise.  In fact why don't you and Bob take us to the Rio on Friday so we can drink, I mean forget about our troubles. 
 Plan on 6:30!  Studlet 
    I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.  PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close! 
 Hey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!   I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.  I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.  But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.  Thanks Again  Paul   PS  At dinner, see if you can seat me next to Nadine, I'll owe you! 
 Hello yourself.  I did fall back asleep, in fact I even overslept.  But I feel good today, real good! 
 I'm in!  What will Felicia be wearing? 
 Well at least that was all you guys buried!  I know you don't like these types of jokes, but I couldn't resist. 
 That's too bad, I would have come down and met you.  What has been going on with you? 
  Did he or didn't he?  You decide! 
 It was a little boy sucking his finger standing next to a dog whose tail is straight up and his butt is hanging out.  The caption read did he or didn't he.  How do you feel today....sore?  I hope, I want to be the man, please let me. 
 Really! 
 Ha Ha Ha!  I thought that part about the teeth out was interesting.
