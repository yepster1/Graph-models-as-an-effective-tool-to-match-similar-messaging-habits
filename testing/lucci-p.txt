   Paul & Stan  Here is our purchase proposal we have been sending out for renewal on our purchase agreements.  We have left it somewhat open ended to account for differences in the individual gas packages.  Please review this proposal, as I will be calling you shortly to discuss any changes or questions you have to the proposal.  You can reach me at (303) 575-6474.   Sincerely,  Paul Lucci 
 Wyoming was great and it was good to see YOU at the game.  What do you mean about odds? 
 Jay,  We are looking to transact with this customer on a two year index purchase.  I need to discuss the details with you, but in the mean time here are the financials that they have provided.  Take a close look at them and realize this is a very rich man and he can have very bad things done to you.  So, let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements.  Paul 
 Hey have you eaten lunch yet?  And when do I get Stacy Mack? 
 I'll give you my first round pick next year, you give me Trent Green. 
 What do you mean draft picks? 
 We can cover the airport so you don't have too.  Just tell everyone we will be at the airport between 1:00 and 5:00ish. 
 Looks like you and I will hang out and wait for Will.  I told Mike we will be at the airport so we can pick everyone up who comes in around these times.  Are you getting these emails? 
 Ok, and yes!  Send me a picture of you so I can remember what you look like.  I mean what you really look like! 
   I called the airline there has been a change of schedule:  New Flight Information: Airline:  Same (United) Flt #:	1670 Airport:	DFW Time:	1:00 pm (arrive DFW)  Make note, if there are any screw ups heads will roll.  Paul   PS  Don't make me wait, NO ONE MAKES ME WAIT!!! 
 Barry,  Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;    Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002. Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory. Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.   I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.  Paul 
 Once again, HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I will talk to Theresa and Gerald.  I'm sorry for all the confusion and will get back to you ASAP.  Paul 
 What do you mean bummer, didn't you pick Oakland?  How was Teddy's? 
 What's up you two losers, and I mean losers!  Anyway, since I have to take time out of my busy schedule and lower myself to your standards here is my itinerary so pay close attention.  I arrive Friday October 5th Airline:  United Flight:	1478 Airport:  DFW Time:	2:21 pm (arrive Dallas)  I leave Sunday at 12:50 pm  I booked two rooms at the Holiday Inn Express, they are in my name but are not paid for yet.  I'll give them a credit card when I get there.  One of the rooms has a King only and the other room has two beds but it's a smoking room, that's all they had.  So smoke um if you got um!  Both rooms have an additional pull out bed, FYI.  I'm looking forward to this weekend, go UT!!!!!!!!!!   Your Master  Paul   PS  I haven't been going to the gym since I started getting laid by this girl. 
 No, Mark is going to Portland, and he just left.  You got our picks on Friday right?  I also need Karen Taylor's phone number, she's hot for me again.  I rally like her little assistant Laura. 
 Hey what's up?  How many people picked the Colts this weekend?  I talked to Todd Gilcrease I guess he's back.  And this time without Kimery.
