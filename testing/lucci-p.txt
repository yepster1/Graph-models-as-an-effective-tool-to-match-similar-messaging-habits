!  The contractor, Todd, isn't acting all that honestly in this bankruptcy stage.  Where and what time do you want to meet tomorrow? 
 Call me on my cell 303 810-5708.  I want to know what's up with tonight. 
 What is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers are coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.  Later for now The Looch 
 Hell No!  Ever since last weekend when you made up some bogus excuse about having to celebrate Natalie's birthday and not being able to party with me, I've been sulking!  What's up for the weekend.  Here's what I have going on; Friday Night-Office Christmas Party, Saturday Night-Hot Tubing with random chicks (any interest?). 
  Check this out it goes on for ever. 
 Well maybe next time I should lay off the free drinks!  I've been screwing off all week.  I went to the AV's game last night and I'm just getting into the office now.  Man I love this job!  Paul 
 Hey where's the happy hour? 
 Great job with Ty!  Now what about the rest of us? 
 I received your email but I could not get to your profile.  I'm getting an error message when I try and bring it up.  I hope you receive this email, if you do see if you can correct the problem on your end. 
 Hi,  I did make the cut and I'm one of the three, in fact I've got to stay around for a certain period of time before Enron will let me go.  I think I'll stay put through the holidays and then see what happens during the first part of January.  I hope your flight went well!  It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday and cold and snowy on Saturday.  Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.  Paul 
 I have attached my resume.  I had to use one of the other guys emails because I was having some problems with my system.  Look forward to seeing you on Thursday. 
 Hey,  I'm not going to be able to get this in on time. 
 Don't worry I'm not going to do it.  Don't I still need to collec
