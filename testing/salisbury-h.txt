 Heather,  I put three swaps in on Friday at the wrong price.  Deal numbers are 660187, 660188, and 660183.  I corrected the prices this morning.  Net loss to STSW and gain to LTSW was no less than $102,000.00  Thanks, Holden 
 Early afternoon tomorrow should work for me.  Thanks 
 Early next week in the afternoon would work best for me.  Thanks, Holden 
 I will attend.  Thank You 
 I spoke with Bloomberg's Paul Callahan.  He confirmed that all daily trades are a $15 flat fee.  On the case of a spread trade like we executed yesterday the $15 flat fee still applys.  Although a spread trade implies two trades, only $15 is charged for the whole package.  Please let me know if you have any more questions.  Also, what do we need to do to change the default in Enpower to better reflect the fee structure.  I believe that term trades are still on the old rate basis.  Thank You, Holden 
 I am working on the Foster system in Portland and was wondering if you have any documentation to help me along.  If not, to whom should I direct my questions?  Thank You, Holden Salisbury
