 We have parked 45 mws with EPE for Monday.  The deal number on the purchase from EPE is 842560.  This power is at Four Corners and the price is $33.00.  Please contact me with any questions.  Thank You, Holden

 I have updated the deal numbers 727040 and 737214 to how I think it should be valued.  When it comes down to it the differential will probably not be that large.  Let me know what the difference is now.  Thanks, Holden 
 This information is in eHRonline.  Thank You, Holden 
 I would like for this product to trade for Sunday and Monday together.  It would be like the Sunday-Monday light load product that now exists except we are stripping out the HE 7-22 on Sunday.  Therefore I would like to include the non-holiday Monday.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Also, any word on the Pinnacle Peak delivery point?  We do not need to provide a bus as this is a common delivery point.  Thank You, Holden 
 Brian McClellan is speaking to Tarcy about this and is getting back to me.  He seems to think that Tarcy will insist that they cannot change the price.  I don't want to pay this.  Thanks 
 Thanks 
 The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system. 
 Here are the purchases we are making for the balance of January. 
 I used this option at Craig today for Monday.  I am leaving the office today early and have not yet input the deal as we are waiting to put it into the Rockies book.  The schedule for 10/8/01 is as follows:  HE 11 - 10mws HE 12-14  -  25mws  That is it.  We are currently out by this amount at Craig in the postion manager.  Let Tom or Mark know if you have any questions, or call me.  Thank You, Holden

 I have not received a credit for this charge on my Amex.  How can I follow up on this.  Thanks, H
