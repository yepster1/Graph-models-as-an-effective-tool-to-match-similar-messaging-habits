 Brian McClellan is speaking to Tarcy about this and is getting back to me.  He seems to think that Tarcy will insist that they cannot change the price.  I don't want to pay this.  Thanks 
 Thanks 
 The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system. 
 Here are the purchases we are making for the balance of January. 
 I used this option at Craig today for Monday.  I am leaving the office today early and have not yet input the deal as we are waiting to put it into the Rockies book.  The schedule for 10/8/01 is as follows:  HE 11 - 10mws HE 12-14  -  25mws  That is it.  We are currently out by this amount at Craig in the postion manager.  Let Tom or Mark know if you have any questions, or call me.  Thank You, Holden 
 805315 805316 805317 794237  These were all out trades that offset each other and were never put into the system.  Thanks, Holden 
 ok 
 I have not received a credit for this charge on my Amex.  How can I follow up on this.  Thanks, Holden 
 I have input the emergency contact information into the system.  My home phone number was in the system.  Thank You, Holden 
 794237  thanks 
 I would like two.  Thank You, Holden 
 yes,  thanks 
 These look good.  Thank You, Holden 
 We delivered to Valley through 12/06/01.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thank you, Holden 
 I have noticed that your seven day forecast has not been updated for several days.  Thank You 
 Anna,  I never received an intinerary for my hotels.  Thank you 
 2 are children  thanks 
  deal numbers for this were 602738 and 602737 
 I changed it.  Thanks 
 I would like this report.  Thank you, Holden 
 Montrose as well. 
 Anna,  I will also be traveling to Colorado on this trip.  Let me know if I can schedule this through you since you know the details or if I should talk to someone else.  Thanks, Holden 
 This is everything for the Southwest Desk.  The only difference is that deal # 528030 is for 50mws and deal # 705583 is RTC.  Thanks, Holden 
 $2.84 is right, I changed it.  Thanks 
 yes 
 I would never do that.  That transmission is not mine.  The only Nevada tranny that I used that day is Enpowered under #'s 702461 abd 704751.  Thanks 
 It seems that PNM is charging an unreasonable amount for losses.  Is there any way we could address this.  Thanks, Holden 
 You can use the same password for all oasis sites:  epmi power 
 FYI,  We seem to be having this problem again.

 Hello,  I am trading for Enron West Power and am curious if we are set up to view your trading screens.  If so what is the login procedure and if not what is required to do so.  Thank You, Holden 
 Here are the purchases we made for next week.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks, Holden 
 So how should these deals be Enpowered in the future?  Cara has wisely warned me not to Enpower multiple strips to avoid this double counting. 
 $35 is correct, I changed it.  Thanks 
 Here are my goals.   Thanks 
 Here is a resume from an aquaintance.  He is interested in an IT position and seems like a good candidate.  Not sure if you are hiring but I believe he is available.  Thank You 
 $51 is the right price.  The deal has been changed.  Thanks 
 I would like to attend.  Thank You 
 LD Mirant for the loss of revenue due to cutting the schedule.  As long as we are kept whole financially then there should not be an issue.  Please let me know if you need any more info.  I assume that you will do the annuity but let me know if you want me to.  Thanks, Holden 
 I have purchased 11mw of firm monthly transmission from Mead 230 to West Wing 500.  The enpower deal number is 671184 and the oasis number is 21397. 
 I am in the Portland office and using Foster.  When I run the transmission report I get an SQL error that I have enclosed a screen shot of.  Also I cannot run the batch scheduler.  Please let me know if you can help.  Thank You, Holden 
 WALC refers to the Pinnacle Peak delivery we are currently performing on.  In Enpower it is referred to as:  Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region - WALC.  The deal number is 705583.  Please let me know if you need any more information.  Thank you, Holden 
 Heather,  I put three swaps in on Friday at the wrong price.  Deal numbers are 660187, 660188, and 660183.  I corrected the prices this morning.  Net loss to STSW and gain to LTSW was no less than $102,000.00  Thanks, Holden 
 Early afternoon tomorrow should work for me.  Thanks 
 Early next week in the afternoon would work best for me.  Thanks, Holden 
 I will attend.  Thank You 
 I spoke with Bloomberg's Paul Callahan.  He confirmed that all daily trades are a $15 flat fee.  On the case of a spread trade like we executed yesterday the $15 flat fee still applys.  Although a spread trade implies two trades, only $15 is charged for the whole package.  Please let me know if you have any more questions.  Also, what do we need to do to change the default in Enpower to better reflect the fee structure.  I believe that term trades are still on the old rate basis.  Thank You, Holden 
 I am working on the Foster system in Portland and was wondering if you have any documentation to help me along.  If not, to whom should I direct my questions?  Thank You, Holden Salisbury

 I would like to enter the drawing for one of the leather type chairs.  Thank You, Holden 
 I would like to keep my current leather type chair.  Thanks, Holden 
 I need all of the Foster applications on my local profile.  I have some of them on local and some of them on my terminal server profile.  I need the same Foster profile that Diana Scholtes has on her local machine.  As of this morning I still do not have it.  Please let me know when my profile gets updated.  Thank You, Holden
