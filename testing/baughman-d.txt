 NO 
 Yes, we are. 
 Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.  In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an  American" signs removed so as to not offend international students.  I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was offending others.  I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants; however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.  First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the "American Way" has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought, bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.  We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society -- learn our language!  "In  God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall, Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.  God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song, and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are
