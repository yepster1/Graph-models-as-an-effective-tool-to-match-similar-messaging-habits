 Please be aware that there is a scheduled power outage in ECS this weekend on Saturday, January 19, 2002. The outage is scheduled from 2:00pm - 4:00 pm.  There should be no impact with the exception of a loss of power to the plasma screens.  In order to protect the plasma screens from becoming damaged during the power shutdown, technical support will need your assistance in turning off all plasmas in your area this Friday at close of business. Desktop Support technicians will assist with turning back on the plasmas on Tuesday morning, January 22, 2002 starting at 6:00 am (as Monday is a holiday).  I am sending this to the admins in ECS. Please forward to anyone I may have missed and please assist us in spreading the word to anyone who may be working on Saturday. Again, the only impact will be the loss of the plasma screens.  Thank you for your assistance in advance! Please call me if you have any questions/concerns  S. Paige Cox Director Global Infrastructure Enron N
