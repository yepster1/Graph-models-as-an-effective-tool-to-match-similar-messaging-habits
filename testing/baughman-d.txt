aded back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. The polar bear said: "Admit it, Frank, you don't come here for the hunting, do you?"

 Lyle,  Thanks for the note.  How did the hunt go?  Did you have to bring decoys?  How did the guides do callin' in the ducks?  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Thanks,  Don Baughman Commercial Manager Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 800-349-5527 
 Anytime after the AGA is fine. Say 3:30 or so.  Thanks,  Don 
 Amigo, Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract, about a month ago.  How is your gig?  Best wishes,  Don Cliff Baughman Jr. Commercial Manager Enron Power Marketing, Inc. Desk:	(800) 349-5527 Cell:	(281) 787-0029

 It's about time you got your email to work!  I called several times this weekend on your cell, no reply.  I hope your hunting trip went well.  Thanks for my birthday supper and present, I had a great time.  Talk to you soon.  Don 
 Bad-dream Shotwell,  I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.  Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.  I am doing well at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and trading.  Enron, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.  How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired! FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?  Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!  Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Drop me a line when you have a chance!  Adios,  Don C.
