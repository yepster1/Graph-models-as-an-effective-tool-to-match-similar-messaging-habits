 fyi, rick 
 You may have an interest in this. FYI Rick 
 As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration.  - The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework. - Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" . - All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. - Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams. - Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. -  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings. - There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio. - All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to help out if needed. - If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. - Encourage weak links in team to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.  The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.  This process should begin immediately.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.  Rick 
 Are you alive? How is your health? Is stress a big part of your life?  Hope all is well. You are doing a great job there for us but if it gets to be too much we'll try to help. I noticed that west power has already made a fortune this year so it must be crazy.  Rick 
 This was an excellent response. No need to take too much grief though. Rick 
 Jeff- this guy sent me this email. Probably not any interest to you, but you can decide.  Rick 
 Please include Bill Bradford if possible. Tx Rick 
 What type of projects? If you give me a brief description of what you are referring to I can forward to the correct person. Thanks, R. Buy 
 Just met w/ Skilling and Whalley.  Var for gas has temp increase of $15MM until next friday (12/15/2000). Jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $40 MM of corp var until next wed (12/13/2000).  One issue is UK power will be over VAR everyday starting probably thurs or fri of this week, unless we increase them as well. (They sweep retail deals into book once a week on this day). This increase only needs to be $2-3- million.  Fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks.  Rick

 Since my daughter is going over to London it prompted me to see if that would be a good time for me to come as well. Then week of March 5. I could stay a day or two if needed. Any thoughts? Rick 
 This is fine by me. Rick Buy 
 thanks- now i  just have to convince jeff-- rick 
 Thanks for the feedback. I sent my best guy there so I hope there is improvement. We have been talking to a candidate for credit that Ted will be discussing with you soon. Hopefully we can make progress there also. I want complete buy in from you and John on this guy before we proceed.  Separately, the scrap metals meeting we had with Causey went well. We will reconvene in two weeks to see where we are.  Thanks again for the feedback. I was a little worried about Ted after the MD disappointment but it seems he has recovered.   Rick 
 Sounds fine to me. Does it make sense to run resume past Brown and Sherriff prior to bringing him over? Also, is the idea he would be a director, sr director or vp? Each of these paths has consequences as you know. Rick 
 I liked him alot. Seems ready, willing and able to make a move. What are your thoughts? Rick 
 Thanks for your note. I want to wish you the best of luck in EES. As far as RAC's issues with EES, I would suggest getting together with Tribolet and getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task force. I would also suggest attending the task force meeting, providing EES management is agreeable, to get a better picture of what is going on.  Again, I hate to see you go but it will still be value added to RAC and Enron. Have fun!!  Rick 
 No- the conclusion is incorrect. The peakers help to mitigate the risk created by market positions. Maybe just change the last sentence to read "Because the peakers offset the contract, the VAR is substantially reduced. " Rick 
 Ted tells me you guys have already taken action on this which greatly relieves me. I did not want this procrastinated on. I have a meeting scheduled with Rick Causey and will get up to speed on what exactly what has transpired prior to that meeting. Thanks for giving this your immediate attention. Rick 
 A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard was going on there.  We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. More to come.  Rick

 Thanks- I am very interested in this business so if I can help let me know. Tx Rick 
 The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001. There was considerable discussion which I have summarized below.  Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a blended debt and equity return.(?)  Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.  Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.  Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough cash to operate.  This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp.  Rick 
 Karen- please print this out and file somewhere. tx rick 
 Please be sure this is in some legal record or something so I don't have problems with this in the future. Thanks, Rick
