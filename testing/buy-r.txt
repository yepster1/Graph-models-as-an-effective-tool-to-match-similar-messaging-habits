ill improve. Rick 
 Looks good to me. Rick Buy (Please pass along to John S. ) 
 great news! i think the ad swap idea is one of the most creative things to happen around here in quite a while. rick 
 Any more on this issue. Rick 
 Missed your call  today and I will be in RAC PRC all day tomorrow. Basically Jeff said we must get this exposure down but gave no parameters to the statement. He did ask if any recent issue is causing us concern to which we said no, and I also said we know more about this company than any other exposure we have (which we should).  I also spoke with M. Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank.  Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU through the plant purchase or other structured deal. Do no more (large) deals with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??) unless we buy a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously. Continue to stay on top of TXU with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close relationship with good communication.  Lets try and discuss Wed if possible. 
 Spoke with Jeff re TXU. Lets discuss when you have a minute. Rick 
 Bad problem, good response. Are there any others where price wasn't being updated? Rick 
 Totally supportive  of candidate. I hope we can get her. Only issue was reluctance to move to Houston or London. That will hurt us eventually. Rick 
 sounds like an opportunity for our illustrious steel team! 
 Can you please add Greg Whalley to the distribution on this report, which by the way is quite bebficial to us. Tx Rick Buy 
 fyi, rick 
 a "senses"?? i love chi-knees- rick 
 Thank you very much for taking the time to provide this feedback. Feedback, both positive and negative, is critical to improving performance. Rick Buy 
 London??? How do we include? Rick 
 Did this go ok. Rick 
 fyi, rick 
 This is fine by me. Do you need hard copy of signature. Rick 
 fyi-comments? rick 
 Approve as written. (Continue to hate the deal). Rick 
 I have already left him a voice mail. Will let you know when I hear. Tx Rick 
 wow! pretty bold move assuming you had a choice.  i will be in london next week, i'll try to give you a call. rick 
 Sounds great. Don't build me a Rolls when a Chevy will do. Rick 
 not to worry- we won't be cutting your budget. lets discuss when you get back. rick 
 I will be out of the office the week between Christmas and New Year's and can be contacted by telephone and fax @ (603) 875-0794. Please make certain that there is coverage at all times for your area. Also, please send Karen your own schedule.  Rick 
 I am not sure I understand this. Can I still surf without going thru the Enron system? Can I still use AOL? I will only need full Enron access about half the time the rest a direct dsl internet connection is what I want. Is the DSL line on all the time or is it still dial up.? Rick 
 you have been busy haven't you, rick 
 I was really hoping we could do this on a best efforts basis with all of us covering any issues arising during the month of December. Since there seems to be insistence on a date certain there is no choice but to have Steve start in EBS on 1-1-2001. Ted can't physically be there until then. It will be difficult to have full RAC responsibility without physically being there. Rick 
 fine 
 to your hearts content 
 Please do not extend offers of employment to anyone without checking with me first. This does not mean a freeze but rather I want to be sure there isn't a person in RAC that may be better suited, or could be with a little training, for a particular position. Thanks, Rick 
 thanks, they do a great job and are an under-appreciated asset at enron. rick 
 Was this a fruitful meeting. Rick 
 We need to discuss this. Sounds like bs to me. Rick 
 Thanks, Rick 
 Any news on this. Rick 
 Has this been verified. Rick 
 This is a good solution. Lets discuss in more detail.  Rick Molly Harris|HOU|ECT wrote on 10/2/00 4:27 pm:    Thank you for your time to discuss Perry Gas.  Michael and I have talked to Jim Keller, EES Legal, and initiated placement of Michael on the Creditor Committee.  We are the largest unsecured creditor.  Jim is working with outside counsel and will be providing documents to Michael to insert him quickly in the process.  Michael will represent us for both EES and ENA.  Regards Molly 
 We need to meet on this. Pls talk to Bill lets get something set up here. Rick 
 yes as we discussed.  rick John J Lavorato|Corp|Enron wrote on 9/12/00 9:14 am:  Can I please extend the 45 million var and the contracts in the power book until the Board meeting on October 11th. 
 Lets discuss Brazil/EI strategy. Rick 
 Fantastic-landmark deal Rick William S Bradford|HOU|ECT wrote on 7/28/00 7:33 pm:  Rick,  John, Jim and Brad were instrumental in getting this restructuring done.  It feels good when the process works.  Bill 
 Send him what was in books but no notes. Tell him it changes daily in a huge way. Tx Rick  PS I stopped down earlier to thank you for a great job on the BOD meeting. See you at 4:30. 
 Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at most everything there in detail).  As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)  Thanks, Rick Buy 
 Karen- please circulate to all RAC worldwide. Tx Rick   It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of Andy Knight, manager in the Market Risk Group. Andy succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 and will have funeral services in Florida. There may be a memorial service here in Houston arranged through his church but details have not been announced. Please contact Veronica Valdez for details.  Andy was with RAC and Enron only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a real impact especially on those that worked closely with him. Andy had  a warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made him a real asset to the group. He will be missed. 
 I approve this request. Thanks, Rick Buy 
 Can you guys make a meeting on March 12 at 10am to discuss something with above group? Rick 
 I attend a regular meeting with AA and Rick Causey discussing EES internal controls. They have asked for a detailed presentation on :  -EAM business -Tariff curve summary and positions against those curves -Credit issues in general.  I will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and get it organized. EES may attend but not present. I think we should give them an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the above areas. Probably a one hour mtg but maybe two. Lets try to meet next week.  Karen- please set up.  Tx Rick - 
 ???????????????????????????????????????????? Rick 
 Was speaking w/ Lavo today on a different matter and he mentioned you were a great help to him in managing his world and was quite complementary overall. I can count on one hand how often this happens in RAC so keep it up.  Great job. Thanks, Rick 
 need to know more. focused on trading? or assets? rick 
 What conference? Rick 
 will not attend, tx rick 
 Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim.  Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.  Thanks, Rick 
 fyi, rick 
 fine by me, rick 
 The Board meeting has concluded and I can now focus on the task force. The following people in RAC have been assigned to this effort as follows:  Legacy Opportunity  Molly Harris Teresa Seibel James Copeland Michael Tribolet Jay Hachen Minal Dalia Don Rollins Rick Carson Jeff Soo Debbie Brackett Sue Vasan  On Going Opportunities  Denise Fury Mark Wilson Dana Smith Andrew Greer Martin O'leary Jay Hachen Dave Gorte Darren Schmidt Vladi Gorny David Port Jeff Soo  This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end, but it is necessary. If you want RAC to lead this effort I will appoint Michael Tribolet to manage the task. If you want someone else to manage the  effort we will assist as we can. Regardless of who leads this effort we need following:  Commitment of EES back office staff people Commitment of IT resources Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.  Let me know how to launch this program.  Rick 
 No- I'm meeting w/ Bradford at 11 to discuss. Want to join us? Rick 
 Great news. Thanks for the heads up. Rick 
 No problem publishing- fake numbers, fake names and the real deal was not done. Should be pretty safe. Rick 
 I'll be in New York. They will have to fly solo on this. Rick 
 What do you think. Probably ok I guess. Rick 
 No further Board approval is required. I'm told that new products on EOL require the lawyers to get involved but that will happen when you request to put the product online. Rick 
 tx- caps were eliminated so this should improve?? rick 
 fyi, rick 
 You may have an interest in this. FYI Rick 
 As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration.  - The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework. - Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" . - All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. - Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams. - Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. -  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings. - There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio. - All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to help out if needed. - If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. - Encourage weak links in team to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.  The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.  This process should begin immediately.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.  Rick 
 Are you alive? How is your health? Is stress a big part of your life?  Hope all is well. You are doing a great job there for us but if it gets to be too much we'll try to help. I noticed that west power has already made a fortune this year so it must be crazy.  Rick 
 This was an excellent response. No need to take too much grief though. Rick 
 Jeff- this guy sent me this email. Probably not any interest to you, but you can decide.  Rick 
 Please include Bill Bradford if possible. Tx Rick 
 What type of projects? If you give me a brief description of what you are referring to I can forward to the correct person. Thanks, R. Buy
