 before we turn anything off. How about 1:00 Tuesday, October 9th in my office or Sheila's office?  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, on NNG and TW, things were quiet.  The SoCal/West of Thoreau spreadsheet is on your desk.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, FYI.  I guess she did get a ticket for $153.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I was in the office for October 1 - 15th.   Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, Maggie and Sheila, if you get comfortable with the direction these emails are going, then we do NOT need to meet.  Let me know if you feel like we need to group together to finalize this issue and be sure we are on the same page.  Otherwise, I would ask that Maggie or Hasan do a final results email and let us know what the outcome is.  Thanks for everyone's help on getting this issue behind us. Lynn 
 Shelley, here are the four PAA's for the people who tested the flowing gas. This does not include Larry or Legale.  Brad, Rick and I are discussing how to handle these two.  The attached PAA's are for Kathy Sturr, Diana Porter, Renee Perry and Jean Adams.  If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. Lynn 
 =09The attached was sent to all the attendees at the NNG Winter Ops Meeting= .  Thought =09you might be interested in reviewing the summary.  If you have any quest= ions, please =09let me know.  Thanks. Lynn (Ext. 3-7637) 
 Lisa, I will not be able to walk, but put me down for $25.00 for you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thought I would send this to you to approve.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, good to hear from you.  The meeting went very well. although I was very nervous about this one. Good response from the customers.  We had approximately 80 customers at the meeting.  I think that is a record.  Call me when you feel like it and I tell you more.  Hope you are feeling well.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Todd, I'll be glad to lead the discussion.  Is this informal or do I have to have a formal presentation?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Large.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Todd, sounds good to me.  Iike that better than a formal presentation.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Alma, please include Terry Kowalke and Darrell Schoolcraft.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jennifer, how long has this been a problem?  Is there a concern we have caused customers problems in nominating due to bad information?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thanks Gerry.  I did not pick up on that.  Lynn 
 Richard, did this get properly taken care of?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Todd, that will be perfect.  I think we will have a very good discussion.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, we have established Monday afternoon after Steve Harris' staff meeting to meet and discuss:  1.  TW Shipper Imbalance Status  2.  OBA termination/Resolution  We will stay in the conference room on 13.  Just wanted to let you know this is replacing our Tuesday morning meeting which was not working well since everyone moved.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. Lynn   We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:  1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)  2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)  4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins. Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact to SoCal's customers)  5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity.  6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.  Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Charlie, let me try calling Delaine in the morning and ask her who is next in the chain of command I should visit with on this issue.  Let's see what kind of a response I get.  If that does not work, then Mike or Shelley may need to call.  I will let you know.  Thanks. Lynn

 Todd, I am planning on attending.  Thanks. Lynn Blair 
 Tracy, thanks for staying on top of this.  It is my understanding the $6500 is for old Shipper imbalances and cleans up all of Dynegy.  Thanks Lynn 
 Ricki, the imbalance meeting will be at 3:30 on Mondays in 1336.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Yes, I am available.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, I am available to meet through lunch.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, I have you on my calendar for 9:00 Friday.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at "small customer delivery points" on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we would at least  throw them on the table.  1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be required in the "Bushton Universe", just not as restrictive as it is today.  2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.  3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes even though they are in the field area?  4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point? I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.  We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn 
  We rely on the information from the Process Responsibility meeting to post weekend coverage to the WEB.  The coverage is posted by Tuesday morning on the WEB, which is a commitment we have made to our customers.  Please ensure you do NOT change any coverage after the Process meeting. You should have the right information going into Monday's meeting.  It does not look good to continually repost this information.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, did you get my message about possibly going to LA?  Looks like I am going unless cost is ridiculous.  Attached is the hotel I would stay in for Wed. night and possibly Thursday night, depending on what you find out with flights. Let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is the supplemental PAA form that needs to be filled out with the form Shelley sent.    Thanks. Lynn 
  Terry and John, is there a master list that we all use for the phoneburst we send out?  If so, who keeps it updated?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Michelle said the Third Party Storage Tariff sheet is #304.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, the other question Michelle had, "Does NNG Contracts have a written procedure for approval of this type of contract?  Please check with Linda Trevino.  We are to meet with Michelle at 10:30 Friday morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, do you keep track of the Phoneburst list?  Let's discuss in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry and Richard, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, have you been keeping track of  the people responding to the invitation? Thanks. Lynn 
 I think there intent was to be very general.  You have the right sheet.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jodie, when you have time let's discuss.  Overall I am OK with plan, but had a question about who was monitoring imbalances.  Sounds like Marketing is instead of Gas Logistics?  Thanks. Lynn 
 So is there nothing for us to do?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, FYI.  Thought you might want for Monday's staff meeting  Donna, you may want to incorporate some of this in the weekly bullets.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, are all our questions answered?  Thanks. L
