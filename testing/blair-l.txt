 It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully) surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital (Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.  I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that. Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with his Mom.  Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.  As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.  Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you in the loop.   John, will you verify with Charlie that Rick Kile and Ronnie have the lead on this and that he is not waiting on us for anything.  Thanks. Lynn 
  I just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01.  There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation.  I made an assumption everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002.  There was still a lot of vacation to be taken.  I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at 2:00 to review your teams schedule for the rest of the year.  We can meet in my office.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava and John, please let me know if we are not going to have this info by Tuesday.  THanks. Lynn 
 An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with storage and determine what changes need to be made.  One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, since Terry is out this week, can you take the lead to find out status of this report as you are checking to consistency with this report and the automation of the storage report.  Let's discuss on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, what is the status of this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, let's go ahead with this day and time.  I will cover for John.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mary, we would love to have you come.  Thanks. Lynn

 Sorry for the change.  But the below referenced meeting has been re-scheduled for:  Wednesday, July 11 at 3:00 p.m. in EB4102  Thanks.  Lynn 
 Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper. Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters as we go through the billing process. Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn 
 It's a surprise!!!!!!!!!!! - We had a choice of 2 different sizes and Ava is checking on some info for us.  Thanks. lynn 
 Mike, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file Jeff sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded). I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed this weekend.  Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone available this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up. 
  Here is our first draft. 
  Tammy, thanks for the update.  Please keep me posted if we are not going to meet Wed. dead line.  Thanks. Lynn

 Sheila, could I have one of the nights next week to give to Laura for Astro tickets? I'll give you one of mine!!!!  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, the DCC (downstream capacity constraint) code was to acknowledge that the downstream is the constraint vs our pipeline being the constraint.  We are working with Tammy and Donna to come up with existing codes to use for Needles and Nigas.  Thanks. Lynn 
 So, why did only Jean and Janet readily respond?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Brad, do we need to bump this concern up a level?  or have you already?  Seems like there has been a LOT of down time.  Thanks. Lynn
