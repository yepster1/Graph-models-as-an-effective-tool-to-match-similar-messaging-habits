l 2000 conversion on the reports went well.  Brad's team was here to help Sunday morning and I believe that made things go smoother.  There were a few isolated situations which were turned around quickly.  Otherwise it was quiet on the pipes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Please plan on attending this meeting for me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I am on vacation those days, so it would probably be OK.  But before we decide, let me know who would be here to cover for you during that time.  Thanks. Lynn

 Terry, are you aware of this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Steve and Audrey, here is the information on the Customer Meeting.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Martha, I would rather give the teams access to the Dashboard.  John Buchanan will be back in the office Wednesday.  You can coordinate with him and Terry Kowalke to get everyone set up.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I do not think it is necessary to have another letter to Oneok from Harry.  Hopefully they get the message with this letter.   Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 =09FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Debbie, here are the two slides for my presentation.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I have a conference call with Delaine at 3:15 today on Strangers Gas.  She is to give me Mike Belcher's phone number.  He is the person coordinating all the condensate issues.  If we send a letter I would send it to Terry Spencer and reference Mike Belcher. If you need more, let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, after talking with Ramona, we need to change Slide 6 to say:  Invoice and Measurement statemenst added to website  Imbalance statements will not be added until next year.  I will talk about this in my presentation. Thanks. Lynn 
  Vernon, Gerry, Raetta and Steve, here are the questions and answer as I recall from the conference call today.  Please let me know of any changes or corrections and I will make them then send to Virginia Power.    Greg, here are the questions and answers that we promised you from the conference call on Tuesday, November 6.  Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.  1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?  Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount (2) RANK changed to a different number  2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?  Answer - Tariff Sheet 267.D & E (Raetta, so you agree?)  3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?  Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group  4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?  Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from the field to the market area. (Greg we may not have been clear on this comment on the conference call) 
  Shelley, do you still want the report Terry is doing each Monday for the TW SOCAL and West of Throeau numbers.  We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations so we could track any possible "holes" in the pipe.  So far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report unless you need it for Stan's meeting?  Remember we give you the Socal Window and scheduled volumes as well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 =09Alicia, thank you very much for the invite, but I will not be able to ma= ke it.  I know it =09will be fun time for everyone.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Joanne, thank you very much for the invitation, but I will not be able to attend.  I know everyone will have a good time.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Just a reminder.  Also, Ava, please help watch my phone during this time frame.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Brad, I do not see any overlap.  Looks good to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Just to clarify Britt's comments.  Harry is using NNG's numbers for total imbalance.  To split the imbalance among the third party shippers, we will continue to use Oneok's allocation of actual volumes.  The variance between Oneok and NNG will go to the Oneok imbalance to tie to NNG's ultra sonic measurement.   Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, I would appreciate any comments or feedback on the attached.  I am trying to formulate my thoughts to be positive and get our message across.  Donna helped me put some info together. Now I need your thoughts.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn

 Wednesday has a lot of meetings for Gas Logistics.  How about Tuesday, November 13 at 1:00 p.m.? or Thursday, November 15, any time.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thursday, 1:30 works for me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Should we discuss before answering Greg?  My answers are in the blue.  I appreciate any feedback. Thanks. Lynn 
 John, FYI.  If you can attend that would be great.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gary, any comments you want to add?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Attached is the spreadsheet Raetta put together after receiving all of the billing information to review the parties involved in the 3.0 bcf long to the pipe position on NNG for October, 2001. If you have any questions, let Raetta or I know.  Sue, the Pinnacle Natural Gas imbalance is the 5,000/day balancing Pinnacle is allowed before volumes go to park and ride. Thanks. Lynn 
 OK, after talking with Gerry, here is my second try at answering Greg's question trying not to get to detailed.  What do you think? 
 Let me try this answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Def. is a part of the Demarc allocation.  When we look at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals) at the storage point.  Don't hesitate to edit my comment.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jo, I apologize.  Your right.  The imbalances are short to the pipe.  To be sure we are all on the same page.  All the deliveries off of NNG on this report took more gas than scheduled and the receipts gave us less than scheduled.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, let's work on how we cancel things.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Greg, I answered your questions in blue.  Please let me know if you need more clarification. Thanks. Lynn 
 Really a short position not long. 
 Cara, I hope you surgery goes well.  Very good memo on keeping the team and management informed.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, let's discuss changes I need for my presentation tomorrow.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Harry, have you seen this?  Are you familiar with the info? I have a meeting at 3:00 with Dan Fancler, Tracy and Steve Weller on the EPPI issues.  Just wondered if you have any detail on this attachment I need to understand?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Should we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?  I had a question from Alliant, "You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation, why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR?  Wouldn't that help the system?"  I think it would be hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all at the same time.  What do you guys think?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Greg, following are the questions you asked and my answers.  Please give me a call if you have any questions. (713-853-7637).  1.  Number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?  Answer:  Yes  2.   Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?  Answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation. When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals) at the storage point.  The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same cycle.  3.  If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from?  Answer:  Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred  4.  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc or Demarc Deferred?  Answer:  Demarc Deferred  Hopefully this helped.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Frank, where are we on the review you were heading up after our conference call with Dave and Measurement?  Looks like more and more customers are questioning our numbers. If there is anything we can do to help you out, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, I am covered as long as you or Jodie are attending.   Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, let me know what kind of feed back you get.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Audrey, put me on the list.  I plan on attending.  Thanks for the invite.  Lynn 
 Lori, please coordinate any testing for the Customer teams for NNG and TW with Mike Bodnar. Thanks. Lynn 
 fyi.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shirley, I have forwarded your message to John.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thought you guys might be interested in this.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Frank, thank you for the update.  I would like to attend this meeting.  Also I added Jodie and Steve on here, because they are very interested in the discussion as well.  I hope that is OK.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mary and Dari, here is my answer.  Are you comfortable with it before I send it to the shipper.  Thanks. Lynn  Answer:  If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1 cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes. Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the operator of the point.  Therefore, they would not encounter a DDVC penalty.  If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines if a DDVC is appropriate.  The DDVC is based on the difference between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.  If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call. Lynn Blair (713-853-7637). 
 Mary, I am going to be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday of next week as well as Monday, November 26th.  Do you need me in the meeting?  If not John Buchanan can attend in my place.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is a VERY HIGH level evacuation plan we can start with in the morning at 9:00 a.m.    Don't panic, bring your additions and improvements to the meeting and we can modify this plan.  I just thought we could start with this.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Let's discuss in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn

 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Alma, please put me on thel ist to attend.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Can you get this note to the people working next weekend.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Bob, you are correct in your statement.  But I want to be sure Koch understand when they nominate their receipt at Carlton of 2828 the delivery on that path will be 2828 less fuel.  Otherwise I agree with you statements.  I will be out next week, but Raetta is up to speed on this issue if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, be sure we discuss this on Monday morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tim and Randy, how did the traning go?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Let's discuss again on Monday if we need to relook at hard coding the allocation based on discussions with Kent and Frank.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Fran, do you have an updated org chart that I could send to the Measurement group? Thanks. Lynn 
  Sharon, would you please set up a meeting as follows sometime after November 27, 2001.  Topic:	Restructure the information on the TW pipe for the morning meeting  Time: 	1 hour  Attendees:	Shelley Corman* Steve January* Darrell Schoolcraft Lynn Blair* Terry kowalke Dale Ratliff*  *Required attendance  Thanks for the help.  Lynn 
 FYI.  Wanted to pass on this information.  After working with Minnegasco to help them use Park and Ride as much as possible (considering we were allocating storage), the Minnegasco scheduler went into the system for Friday's gas day and changed their business between Intraday 1 and Intraday 2.  This caused cuts through Demarc and Mid 17.  We tried to help as much as possible and keep the same rules we have with all other shippers. If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jean, here is a blank PAA form to fill out if you have someone you want to recognize. Please fill out the form and send to Steve and John for approval since I will be out of the office until next Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, here is a first review of the document to the employees.    Thanks. Lynn

  I will be on vacation Tuesday, November 20 through Monday, November 26.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, November 27th.  John and Terry are in the office all week and Terry is on call for the holiday weekend for scheduling issues.  Terry and Steve can get a hold of me over the holidays if needed.  For accounting issues, Raetta and Larry will be in the office Tuesday and Wednesday, with Raetta taking a half day vacation on Wednesday.  All of you have a great Thanksgiving with your families.  I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Looks good to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Debra, thanks for your reply.  Are you comfortable now that you can perform this function instead of Raetta if Jean is gone?  Does Jean need to have more specific instructions to cover Transok that specifies the timing for putting the allocations in the system?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tim and Mike, would it be appropriate to have Mike call Bill and get specifics from him?  Then we can do a conference call to explain the cuts?  Just a suggestion.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Don, this is great.  This report was a big hurdle for us.  I will check with the team on how it is working.  Thanks for all your support as we go forward in our Business Objects training. Thanks. Lynn
