 Jeff, Sorry for all the resumes lately, but everyone wants to get their foot in the door at Enron.  This resume is from my wife's cousin, who is looking to get a summer internship at Enron.  She is a very sharp young lady with a great work ethic.  I don't know if you are hiring for internships, if not, could you please forward this on to the person hiring for those positions.  I greatly appreciate any help you could give.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks again for your help.  Laura Perkins  - resumefinal.doc
