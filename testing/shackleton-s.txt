you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.  I look forward to receiving the memo and chart.  Thank you and regards.  Sara  P.S.  Please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum. 
 All:  I know that AFAC is busy with Enron matters.  However, I received this response from him on Monday (yesterday).  I have not spoken with either AFAC or Marcelo but it appears that they are very close to at least a "first draft".  My thought is that we review the response and identify specific areas and/or issues for refinement and then schedule a meeting in S.P.  I'll advise as soon as I hear further.  Sara 
 I haven't reviewed yet but here it is!  Sara 
 Yes.  This would be a helpful "insert" in the negotiations manual.  I always worry that we receive explanations about a variety of issues and we don't keep a written record of the advice received.  SS 
 Dale:  can you have someone review the transaction terms.  I'm not sure that this is a swaption.  I'll also take a look.  I do not have a voice yet but I am in the office.  Sara 
 I know nothing.  SS 
 David:  Could I see a copy of the AMEREX below referenced agreement which you approved?  I would appreciate your response today.  Thanks.  Sara 
 What is Merrill? 
 Sorry to have to respond via e-mail but I've got laryngitis (although I should be in most of the day today).  The actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us.  BUT, the broker WILL NOT open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which includes:  authorizing resolutions (or unanimous consent) from the account party trading authorization number of signatures for transacting  Marie previously sent "samples" of the the underlying documentation to Robert George.  We have not received anything to date.  When we receive the information, we can fax EVERYTHING to the broker and the account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard copies.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara 
 You indicated that you'd be finished by Wednesday.  Can you give me the comparision?  Thanks.  Sara 
 So  you were able to put Janet in her place!  If you have questions, please come in  my office.  I can write and shake my head "yes" or "no"!  Sara 
 Mike, thanks for your patience.  I have severe laryngitis so I cannot even speak.  I received a copy of the index for the Utah statute to which Deseret is subject.  I'm afraid that I need Utah counsel to answer my questions.  I'm working on that right now.  If you call me, I'll only be able to respond via e-mail.  Sara 
 I'd like to attend.  SS 
 Sorry I can't wish you well in person but I have a severe case of laryngitis!. Fortunately, I'm on antibiotics but the doctor said "Don't speak for 3 days.  I wish my wife would get laryngitis."  Maybe the desert air in Arizona would bring relief.  I love saguros (is that right?)  Daddy thought planning for Chanukah was a great idea.  Also, tell Daddy that if he used e-mail I could talk to him even when I have laryngitis.  Love, Sas 
 Brent and Lynn:  I have a severe case of laryngitis and I can't even speak. I'm not sure that I'll be able to (or even should) speak on Friday for our 9 am (Houston) conference.  Brent, I was wondering if you would be in Houston next week before our legal conference on Thursday and Friday.  If so, then maybe you, Lynn and I can meet to assess the situation.  If not, then let's please reschedule our Friday call for Monday or Tuesday of next week.  I can suggest Monday after 10 am.  Tuesday morning we have Randy's call which I may have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on Tuesday, it should be after 10:30 am..  Please let me hear from you. Thanks.  Sara  p.s.  I have not had an opportunity to review the memo but I'm going to take a look today. 
 Kaye:  I e-mailed David Portz this morning and he hasn't opened the message. Can you please (1) find out if he's even in the office today AND (2) just get a copy of the agreement which Dale is referencing below.  Thanks.  SS 
 Have you heard if Brent will be in Houston this week or early next week?  SS 
 With pleasure!  SS 
 Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya Rohauer will know.  FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT International."   SS 
 Pat, your credit worksheets reflect ENA posting cash.  Is this a mistake?  I am trying to revise these draft masters and then I will tackle TGS.  I still have severe laryngitis so I cannot speak but I can communicate via e-mail or a paralegal.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I have retained Utah counsel.  I'll keep you posted.  I haven't looked at your other question yet but I will !  Sara 
 The agreement must be executed by a VP or higher level.  Do you want us to have Jeff Shankman execute?  SS 
 Melissa:  Were you working on this for Chris?  SS 
 Janine:  Thanks for the update.  Any word on the Japanese FX desk principal?  Sara 
 Blair:  I sent this to you yesterday.  Sara 
 Matt:  This is still outstanding and we may have to change Part 3 of the Schedule to reflect the change.  DID YOU SPEAK WITH OUR FRENCH LAWYERS?  Please let Stephanie know.  Sara 
 great!    Melissa Ann Murphy 12/14/2000 02:22 PM 
 Mark:  Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.  Each of those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the economic terms of each deal.  Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a "deemed" version of such an agreement or (3) "terms and conditions" appearing in the confirmation itself.  It is quite likely that in any of these three types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or termination, etc.  which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the Canadian company.  Further, there may be credit issues associated with the transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).  As a result, a party attempting to "step into the shoes of the Canadian company" must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with assuming those positions.  Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading positions of the Canadian company.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Carson: Yes, Monty, Keith and I had a great lunch at Galatoire's last Friday.  Monty had to leave early for a soccer game in Memphis (I think).  Maybe we can get Donna to raid the X-mas wine in the cellar.  Sara    "R. Carson Llewellyn" <carlew@flash.net> 12/14/2000 09:37 AM 
 Susan:  Thanks for the update.  Gary Hickerson wants this product available on EOL= =20 now (which explains why I am called daily by the trading desk).  Do you kno= w=20 when a decision on the Japanese FX principal will be forthcoming?  Sara 
 FYI - I don't know anything about this deal other than the fact that Chris Foster asked me a question.  I referred Chris to Christopher who had worked on the APEA transaction which had similar issues.  SS 
 Attached is our format 
 I'll verify with Susan ASAP 
 Melba:  The product description requires the following change in part (iii) regarding the Enron principal:  "...Enron Japan Corp. as agent for Risk Management & Trading Corp. ..."  Please submit the revised description to me.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Chris:  Please call. The parties need to exchange documents and the boilerplate (which we are unable to send) requires execution.  If you must trade today, we could exchange fax signatures and your counterparty can fax evidence of authority to enter into the master and transactions.  In any event, we need to execute duplicate originals, one for each party.  Sara 
 Special Provisions for Confirmation of this Transaction:   Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement, unless Counterparty executes this Confirmation and transmits the executed Confirmation to ENA via facsimile to the facsimile number hereinbelow provided prior to 5:00 p.m (CST) on December 15, 2000, this Confirmation and theTransaction evidenced herein shall be completely null and void and without force and effect.   ENA's telephone and facsimile number for purpose of confirming Transaction:                      __________________________________ 
 Melba:  This looks fine.  Sara    Melba Lozano 12/15/2000 02:27 PM 
 Thanks so much!  Sara    "Dranguet, Beth Ann" <badranguet@velaw.com> 12/15/2000 04:20 PM 
 I thought we had devised a format for any response.  I'm glad to meet with you anytime.  Currently, I have severe laryngitis and I am unable to speak. I will probably be limited on Friday as well.  We can manage if you come to my office.  Let me know.  SS 
 Sam:  We need to send an execution package Fed Ex for Tuesday morning delivery. The file is in my office as I need to speak with these guys on Monday.  Chris Foster is the Enron contact in Portland.  Thanks.  Sara 
 John Suttle spoke with Jeffrey Pak.  All is fine.  Sara 
 Kaye:  the attached "Enron forward" document below needs to be compared against the "forward template" that you saved in my directory today (confirms/equity).  I have an 11 a.m. meeting with Clint et al on Monday.  I'd like to have the comparison before the meeting, if possible.  Please let me know if this is possible.  Sara 
 Kaye:  I would like to schedule a meeting after Christmas (Dec. 27 0r 28 if possible) with the following people;  Samantha Boyd Stephanie Panus Cheryl Nelson Cassandra Schultz (X30429 - you'll need to call her assistant) 
 Richard:  Have you sent a letter?  The first payment should be due (for the month of November, 2000, billed in early December, 2000).  Sara 
 Hey, Brant:  We still have some of the same issues.  Sara 
 Susan:  I need to review with Brant but here's your copy.  Sara 
 Phil:  I was just checking to see when we would execute the amendment to the Security Agreement (to permit the rehypothecation of securities).  Please let me hear from you.  Regards,  Sara 
 OK, let me try to catch up here.  Brent may not get my e-mail for awhile.  I believe that he is in Houston today on personal business and will stay until the conclusion of the ENA legal conference which is Th & Fr next week.  What is your availability on Mon or Tues next week?  I will try to put something together (at least you and I can have a game plan so that we can plan our next visit to SP).  This voice stuff is a bummer.  Sara 
 Ed:  Please respond to item (2) regarding EWEB.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  EWEB has not commented on the CSA. 
 Holli:  I have still not received the above-mentioned comments.  I have also not received EWEB's proposed form of legal opinion.  I will go ahead and blackline the Schedule once again.  When the lawyers last spoke, we agreed to execute all docs prior to the end of the year.  Would you please call EWEB and inquire about these items?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Holli:  Please verify that the earliest TRADE DATE with EWEB was October 30, 2000 (which was approved by the EWEB Board on October 3, 2000 according to the December 5, 2000 resolution).  I have a copy of the resolution.  Thanks. Sara 
 ED:  A second EWEB question:  EWEB wants the definition of "Applicable Rate"  to remain without changing to the Non-default Rate if the payee is the defaulting party.  They say they must have a "balanced rate".  Please let me hear from you.  Sara 
 We need to send today BUT we need an immediate cover letter (itemizing every step to be taken) and sample resolution format to email to the counterparty and lawyer.  I'll review the letter.  I have an 11 am meeting but should be back in an hour.  Let me know if you have questions.  Sara 
 Maria:  Can you provide me with a blackline of one of the confirms below marked against the draft which Enron marked up and faxed to Steve on September 1, 2000?  The current format contains a number of changes and it would be easier to review.  The directory on that document reads "Ext. ID[.]".  We want to respond quickly, today being our goal.  Thanks.  Sara    "Chiodi, Maria" <maria.chiodi@csfb.com> 12/13/2000 05:02 PM 
 Per our discussion - Sara 
 Beth Ann:  Here's UBS's  "redraft" which also requires review.  Please call me in a few hours if I haven't contacted you.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Phil:  Why don't you execute (duplicate originals) and overnight to me? I'll return an original to you tomorrow (overnight), as well.  I'm located, specifically, at:  1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, TX  77002  Please call if you need anything.  Thanks.  Sara    <Philip.Levy@chase.com> 12/18/2000 12:18 PM 
 Attached is the document comparing the Sample Forward Confirm against the 11-13-00 Enron Forward. 
 Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice today or tomorrow.  Sorry.  We can e-mail or speak through Marie. Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.  I don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.  I was out sick yesterday. Hope this brings you up to date.  SS 
 FYI only - no response required Please advise if I'm copying you on too many "equity related" emails. Sara 
 Chris:  The master you are referring to was drafted in March, 1999 in the name of "Air Liquide America Corp." and needs to be updated from both a credit and legal perspective.  Last time, Kelly Minear had to visit the counterparty's office to review financials since the company was private.  We will need an updated credit worksheet to prepare a new draft.  Tracy and Ed:  Will  one of you update the prior credit to begin the process?  Thanks.  Sara    Chris H Foster 12/19/2000 08:49 AM 
 Sam:  Don't you have a new address by now?  I remember you said that you were moving into a plush high-rise overlooking the great southern city of Atlanta, home of the Peach Bowl!   Please email me and let me know.  A belated thanks for the birthday card.  I had a fabulous birthday in Napa Valley at Auberge d'Soleil with my little sister and friends.  We drank wonderful wines and dined in great restaurants - and had great weather.  Hope you're doing well.  Have you started any new business ventures?  Maybe taken Wendy's to Amelia Island Plantation?  Or better yet, purchased the water rights to Palm Springs?  I'm just hangin' in Houston, same old job, etc.  I joined my two friends Monty and Keith for our annual birthday celebration at Galatoire's about two weeks ago.  It's always great fun.   I think I get to plan a reunion of Gordon, Arata et al ex-pats.  There are about thirty of us scattered around the country.  My regards to Beverly and Helen.  Sara 
 Maria and Steve:  Attached are blacklines of the two forwards.  Sorry for the delay.  I'll call Clint and we'll try to call.  Sara 
 Christine:  Attached are Enron Corp.'s comments to your form of forward.  I'll try to have Jeff and'or Clint available for a conversation.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I am looking for this blue file for a year-end negotiation with CSFB/Enron Corp.  Does anyone have this file?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jim:  In connection with our disussion regarding Market Quotation and "Reference Market - makers" in the Schedule (specifically Enron's request to delete clause (b) to the Section 12 definition), I am advised that it would be difficult to locate four leading dealers with offices in the same city.  With respect to the outstanding trades, for example, we would like to know which city has  four leading dealers  for quoting Mid-Columbia prices?  Please let us know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 ok just no voice.  Thanks. 
 Beth Ann:  Here's the support sent by UBS.  You may already have already reviewed.  Sara 
 FYI  Susan Flynn sent a draft of this ISDA on 5/11/00.  Credit will be sending a new credit worksheet shortly.  We'll need to create a new draft.  Sara 
 Marlene:  I'll call Lesley with my comments.  What is the second attachment called "Cancellable" relating to Captiva III Finance CBO? Sara    "Lue, Marlene P." <Marlene.Lue@bmo.com> 12/19/2000 04:10 PM 
 It might be helpful if you dated the doc with the effective date of the authorizations.  Sara    Veronica Valdez 12/19/2000 03:09 PM 
 Marlene:  The language is fine.  We will retain this as a template for Transactions have an Optional Early Termination Date.  Please send the revised confirm(s) to our desk.  Sara    "Lue, Marlene P." <Marlene.Lue@bmo.com> 12/20/2000 09:20 AM 
 Christine hasn't reached David Kelly but is trying to meet with him today.  I need to send comments but I was hoping to speak with V&E first.  Jim is available in the am.  Jim has not heard from CSFB. 
 Trigger/Determined Amount inverse relationship:  "In the event the Trigger Price is increased to equal the Other Trigger Price, the Determined Amount shall be reduced so that the Effective Share Price is increased in direct proportion to the increase in the Trigger Price.  The "Effective Share Price" shall be the result obtained by dividing X by Y where "X" equals the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the Number of Shares, and "Y" equals the Number of Shares plus the Determined Amount."   Paragraph 3(a) first paragraph, 3rd sentence replacement:   "In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled "Other Provisions," Party B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares. Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of a cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess Shares by the Final Price]." 
 Hey, man, what's up?  Have we thought this through practically? 
 FYI only 
 Jim:  I have not seen any Enron Corp./CSFB agreements.  ENA has two different agreements with CSFB:  (1)  ISDA dated4/21/93.  This had:  NY law, submission to non-exclusive jurisdiction of NY courts/waiver of objections to venue, limitation of liability  (2)  Futures Agreement dated 9/21/00.  This had:  NY law, arbitration, limitation of liability 
 Christine Lee has arranged for the UBS lawyer, David Kelly, to be available for a  conference call on Dec. 21 at 9 a.m. HOUSTON TIME (10 a.m NY TIME). Enron will call Christine at UBS.  Christine has discussed our document (markup of forward confirmation emailed to everyone on 12/19/00) with the lawyer.  Jim:  Can we get your small conference room?  Sara 
 Clint Freeland (who is trying to remain optomistic) would like to have signature pages for the forwards executed prior to final negotiation.  We are drafting Bear.  We can print signature pages for CSFB and UBS which are on single pages.  Lehman will be emailed (I think) tomorrow.  Please follow up with me please.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Jim:  Attached is a revised Schedule.  We have accepted most of your changes.  I believe that the outstanding issues include:  1.  Please note the revised Threshold which we previously discussed. 2.  We accepted Portland as a forum for arbitration. 3.  We need to discuss your invoicing procedure. 4.  We are waiting to comment back on the revised reps pending receipt of the CSA and legal opinion. 5.  We have added some language to the recording provision to acknowledge internal recording destruction policies. 6.  We have not revised the Reference Market-maker provision.  Have you had a chance to consider my email of 12/19/00?  Please let us know when we will receive the remaining documentation so that we can finalize our negotiations.  Regards.  Sara 
 Chris:  We emailed the Schedule on Dec. 18.  We Fed Exp'd the "package" (except the ENE guaranty which is being executed) on Dec. 19 to the lawyer at your direction.  Sara 
 Sorry, I had an incorrect address.  Sara 
 Mark; I thought you should see this - Sara 
 Brent is supposed to be in Houston but Mark didn't know if Brent would be in the office today or tomorrow (he has personal business in Houston).  You might check with Taffy.

 Melissa: Attached is a format that would be great! 
 I'll talk to you in the morning.  Sara    Melissa Ann Murphy 12/21/2000 04:47 PM 
 Here's the reason the Lehman MASTER AGREEMENT has not been executed.  SS 
 I need an ENA signature (Chase master amendment that Tana was working on) tomorrow and maybe Enron Corp. 
 Holli:  As you know, Enron is closed on 12/26/00.   I'll try to schedule a call for 12/27/00.  I have not received the CSA yet so we cannot do anytning on that front.  Also, will you please tell me where the dealers able to quote Mid-C are located (since EWEB has not answered my prior email)?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Enron is closed on Tuesday 12/26/00.  We can talk on Wednesday 12/27/00, at your convenience.  Also, I will be out of the office on Friday 12/29/00. Will I have your CSA before 3 pm Houston Time today? Regards.  Sara    Jim Deason <Jdeason@chbh.com> 12/21/2000 07:36 PM 
 I haven't sent it yet. 
 Beth Ann:  I received your message and tried to speak with CSFB and Jim Armogida.  In each instance, unfortunately, I had to leave voice mails.  It was just about 2 hours ago that I told CSFB that we were done (having left the negotiation of Paragraph 10.1 to Jim)!  I am forwarding the latest UBS comments to you just in case I have the urge to call you for advice.  Have a Merry Christmas.  I'm off to New Orleans this evening for the holiday weekend.  In fact, there's a new Susan Spicer restaurant called "Herbsaint" and I should be dining there in about 6 hours.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Holli:  I have not heard back from Jim Deason on the CSA or comments to our Schedule.  I will not be in on Friday, Dec. 29.  I think one of your transactions takes effect in January. Please let me hear from you.  Sara 
 fyi 
 Friday,  11/22/00 was an Exchange holiday.  "Preceding" is fine as the business day convention as long as the change is made in all of the relevant swaps.  SS    Greg Johnston 12/27/2000 09:00 AM

 Please check this latest draft and call me at (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara  Sara 
 Let's do it on Tuesday, Oct. 26 at 2 pm.  If Brent is available, all the better.  Let me know if you want to visit Enronland.  I don't mind the walk. Sara 
 This was received Friday evening.  Clint has not seen but we have been discussing this morning.  Sara 
 Further to my email of 12/21/00,attached is the revised Schedule.  Please let me know if you have any problems with the document.  Sara 
 here's the draft I resent to Bear.  Sara 
 Holli:  Will you be on this call? Also, you never answered my question about reference market makers.  Please call me early today.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I have been called for Jury Duty on January 16, 2001. 
 I would like to sign up for the following presentations:  (1)  Power Marketing - Structuring Power Transactions on November 10 and 11 (2)  Fundamentals of Corporate Finance on  December 2  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sam:  I accidentally deleted this CP from the list (when I was trying to delete CSFB from the ISDA section).  You will need to reconstruct.  I'm sorry.  Sara 
 Ken:  Please let me hear from you as soon as possible today.  I will not be in the office on Friday, Dec. 29.  In connection with the blacklined confirmation which we discussed yesterday, please  (1)  verify that there are no changes (or if there are changes, we need to discuss) (2)  provide Bear's information for Paragraph 8 (Offices) (3)  advise if you wish for us to finalize the document or if you would prefer to do so  We would like to exchange faxed signatures today, if at all possible.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Maria is expecting your call.  Sara 
 Add some liquidity for me!  Have a Happy New Year!  Sara  P.S.  Who knows:   you may run into Susan B.    Robert Bruce@ENRON Sent by: Robert Bruce@ENRON 12/28/2000 03:15 PM 
 Sharen:  In connection with the two (2) swap confirmations which you are revising (from a "Deemed ISDA" format to a regular ISDA format), I ask that you please contact  Stephanie to review the final forms.  Please note the following:  (1)  Melissa's prior "Deemed ISDA" drafts (dated Nov. 22, 2000) show ENA swap nos. as 447459.4 and 447459.02.  One of your confims doesn't match:  it says 447459.04.  Please verify the correct number.  (2)  You can eliminate the "Payment Date(s)" section from the General Terms because individual Payment Dates appear in both the Fixed and Floating Details.  After either Tana or Stephanie have approved, please email to EWEB as follows (with a copy to Holli Krebs):  jdeason@chbh.com Dick.Varner@eweb.eugene.or.us  NOTE TO STEPHANIE:  copies of my markups  and the Deemed ISDA's are located in a file entitled "EWEB confirmations".  Also, the ISDA has not been signed but will be dated October 30, 2000. 
 ED:  EWEB has requested a blackline of the ISDA and is ready to sign next week. Your MAC references the "Electric System" which is defined in the Bond Indenture which I sent to you earlier today.  It looks to me like the Electric System includes physical and intangible assets acquired by the Board as a separate utility system, including generating and transmission facilities and the Trojan Project (not sure what this is).  I've asked Stephanie to revise our docs to incorporate these definitions.  Please review the CSA when Stephanie sends it to you (and comment) and I can send first thing on Tuesday.  Thanks.  Sara  Stephanie:  Please send Ed a copy of the blacklined CSA when you are done. 
 Dick:  Sorry that I didn't have a chance to call you again today.  After reviewing the appendix (Board resolution summary), I would like to request an opinion from EWEB's bond counsel that swap/other transaction payments are payable from the Operating Fund (together and in parity with other operating costs) and precede EWEB's debt service payments.  Also, can you please describe EWEB's Master Resolution (relevant to long term bonded indebtedness) as this is to be referenced in Larry Cable's legal opinion.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday, Jan. 2.  Have a happy new year.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Stephanie:  Happy New Year!  I have assigned you to this former Marie Heard file.  We need to overnight copies of the master agreement (boilerplate and all) to Neel Lemon in Dallas.  He does not need ENA's or the CP's background documentation.  You can send the ENE guaranty.  This company has undergone a franchise tax restructuring and has survived as a limited partnership which we are in the process of evaluating.  I'll bring the file to you.   Details to follow soon.  SS 
 All:  Following is a list of outsanding items:  (1)  ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule and Credit Support Annex) I need to better understand EWEB's proposed settlement language.  ENA generally sends an invoice when the counterparty owes a payment (but not when ENA owes a payment).  The invoice reflects the outstanding transactions for a given Calculation Period and the net amount owed.  ENA can   generate this invoice in all cases.  Does EWEB intend that BOTH parties always send reciprocal invoices?  Is is necessary that the Calc Agent ALSO  make a phone call?  What does EWEB's language "separate invoices and documentation covering each Transaction sufficient to permit the other   party to comply with its interanl accounting and record keeping procedures concerning individual Transactions" mean?  Please call me to resolve.  When can we execute?  (2)  Cable Huston legal opinion:  please add  (1)  opening paragraph:  "(iii)  the Confirmations for Transactions ENA Contracts Nos. 447459.02 and 447459.4 each dated October 30, 2000 ..."  (2)  Paragraph 12 prior to the period in the first sentence:  "as  those terms are defined in the Master Resolution adopted by the EWEB Board on June 16, 1986, as supplemented"  (3)  the two (2) confirmations These require execution by EWEB.  When will this be done?  (4)  Bond Counsel opinion Dick, I sent you  an email on Friday.  ENA is pleased to discuss with your counsel.  Please refer to Larry's legal opinion:  the deleted Paragraph 10 of the December 21, 2000 draft and the Paragraph 12 of the  December 30, 2000 draft for the type of information requested.  Please let me know if I have left out any items.  I would like to finalize documentation today.  Regards.  Sara 
 Sorry, but I forgot to ask if I should make reservations and if anyone else is going.  Thanks.  Sara 
 LaureL:  Please let me know where you end up (ENA, Enron Corp., ECT Investments) so that I can be clear in Lotus Notes and the files for future reference.  Thanks.  Sara

 Phil:  Happy New Year!  And back to old business.  ENA is holding the amendment pending receipt from you of the attached Exhibit A (describing the collateral).  I had previously left you a message but I'm sure it was lost in the year-end madness.  Please forward the attachment so that we have a complete document.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Stephanie:  I have reviewed the attachment and it is correct.  We should attach and return one to Phil.  We need one copy for the file, credit and Soma.  I'm not sure who else might need but we can check with Soma.  Sara 
 Chris:  I checked with Samantha.  The counterparty is holding two orignal ISDA documents (complete with boilerplate and Schedule/CSA) and ENA resolutions (in the form of unanimous consents) and incumbency.  Sam will check on the ENE guaranty.  There is nothing more that we can do unless you want us to call the counterparty/lawyer.  Please advise.  Sara 
 Angela:  Unless Mary has addressed already or a different plan is in place, can you handle?  Sara 
 Jeff:  In connection with the instructions given by London to Shane Dallmann, note that the instruction for ENA to transact the Euro hedges was given by Peter Russell.  Please advise as to whether these should be RMT transactions and which Enron affiliate should be involved.  Thanks.   Sara 
 Speak of the deviI!  I just had someone leave a voice mail for counsel (who is at an outside meeting).  I will definitely have a lawyer call tomorrow morning.  Is Utah in your time zone?  Sara 
 Terry:  Clint Freeland asked that we resend our forward confirmation template to you.  It is attached below. Also, we will send a draft of our ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule only,  no boilerplate) to you shortly.  Can you provide me with the name of your attorney so that we can email directly?  It seems that Enron North America Corp. is currently negotiating an ISDA with First Union National Bank and sent a new ISDA draft to the attention of Delene Travella on 11/08/00.  There may be an efficient way to handle both master agreements simultaneously.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards,  Sara

 Dick:  After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we add a section to the Schedule entitled "Accounts" (Part 3(h)) as follows:  "Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall provide Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an invoice prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to Party B. With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise directed in writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment instructions:  [bank, account no., ABA no.]"  Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any comments.

 Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.  I cannot locate the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.  The Enron party is ENA.  We now need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.  ENA's use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market, corporates, JGB's.  We need to:  (1)  remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader)  (2)  add the following:       Darren Delage Shane Dallmann Ellen Su Pushkar Shahi Gary Hickerson  THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.

 Tom:  I'm trying to finalize the ISDA Master Agreement with these guys.  We have one issue:  If there is a long-term market disruption event (i.e. over 3 days), and we have no fallback price, then we negotiate a price and ENA would normally obtain 2 quotes and average them.  Our position is that we prefer to obtain the quotes because if a disruption were to occur, we would obtain quotes for hundreds of deals in the same manner (because our agreements will all have the same provisions) and it is possible that 4 quotes may not be available.  NYSEG would like for each of ENA and NYSEG to obtain 2 quotes and then average the 4 quotes.  Are you agreeable to this?

 Below is a document containing "General Terms and Conditions" which is ALWAYS attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master agreement.  If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit provisions),  Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of credit format.  I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.    Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex (which are the two "customized" pieces negotiated by legal) .

 To my knowledge, we will trade these instruments via internal broker platforms (i.e., ENA traders will trade online rather than over the phone), such as Goldman Sachs, or directly over the phone.  All trades will be confirmed either online or verbally and ENA will receive a daily statement reflecting trades done the previous day.  ENA does not prepare a confirmation but will need to check out the broker statements.  I believe that these debt securities are issued in either book-entry form (in variable denominations) or as registered certificates (e.g., undivided interests in a mortgage pool).  We will trade US agencies and Japanese bonds with Goldman.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

 Tanya:  Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format as much as possible.  Please call me to update.

 Chris:  There is a March 26, 1993 Master Commodity Price Swap Agreement between ERMS and Praxair, Inc.   However, it is limited to natural gas price swap transactions.   This is an extremely old, outdated form of agreement.

 I've left a message for Dave Adams (legal) to call back AND described to him the following situation:  ENA and NRG have executed OVER 130 financial deals both online (EOL) and offline WITHOUT EVER CHANGING ANY OF THE GTC's. In the absence of an executed master agreement, we never want the GTC's to change!  The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.  If you don't have an ISDA master agreement in place, you want your single set of GTC's to be viewed by a court as a single agreement.  Having different versions of the GTC's does not look like a single agreement.  I will try to convince Dave Adams that we should retain our GTC's but move forward on an ISDA which would then govern all online and offline trades.

 Tanya:  I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer "yes" or "no", etc.  1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First Union National Bank, Charlotte)  2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and $50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.  3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.  4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):  (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and L'C's  (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?  (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include "Baa3 by Moody's" and "failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's".  (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of "Qualified Institution" to include not only the rating we assign, but also "having assets in excess of $10 billion" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party  (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands be made prior to 5 pm New York time.  5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of First Union National Bank):  (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we proposed)  Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly appreciated.

 Hey, Clem:  Hope you had a great New Year!  I'll try to make this easy so that you can respond "yes" or "no":  (1)  FUNB wants ENE remain liable for payments covering "any other damages, costs and attorney's fees".  Do you agree?  (2)  FUNB only wants to make a demand for payment with no strings attached. I'll try to whittle the demand period down from five days to three.  Do you agree:  (3)  Guaranty to be governed by NY law.  Agreed?  I'm sure you enjoyed this little exercise if I hear back from you.  Thanks.

 Sorry, but I still can't talk.  Although Marie is not in today, I can have Susan Bailey (Ext. 34737) contact Morgan to alert them that the faxed docs are coming.  We also will need a signature on the agreement itself and I can't recall if Marie sent that already.  Please call Susan so that we can be more specific about what might happen today (and whether it can wait until Monday morning when Marie returns).  I have not received anything from Robert.  Thanks.

 Hi, Dee:  A few pieces of information from credit.  1.  With respect to ENA's swap counterparty, we note that the rated entity per S&P is "First Union National Bank, Charlotte".  You need to let us know which entity is in fact the swap party.  2.  Regarding Threshold for cross default, $100,000,000 is fine.  3.  Regarding financials, if you want to provide us with First Union Corp. financials, we will need a guaranty and credit will switch to the guarantor.  4.  10 year bonds are OK with a haircut (probably 90 or 95%).  5.  Credit is still reviewing the matrix  6.  Your changes to the MAC trigger are fine.  7.  Your comments to our definition of "Qualified Institution" have been rejected.  8.

 Jason:  Here's my suggestion for item (ix) [Additional Event of Default] event on page 2 of the Schedule:  "In the case of Party B, Enron North America Corp. .... owns less than a majority interest in Party B unless within five (5) Local Business Days of such occurrence, Party B posts collateral with Party A (i) in an amount equal to Party A's Exposure under this Agreement plus $250,000, but in no event greater than 125% of Party A's Exposure, and (ii) in a form satisfactory to Party A in Party A's reasonable discretion.  "Exposure" shall mean for any relevant date for which Exposure is calculated, the amount, if any, that would be payable to Party A by Party B pursuant to Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) of this Agreement as if all Transactions were being terminated as of the relevant date; provided that Market Quotation will be determined by Party A using its estimates at mid-market of the amounts that would be paid for Replacement Transactions (as that term is defined in the definition of "Market quotation") in order to ensure that Party A does not suffer an economic penalty."

 Bob:  Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to form changes.  If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to "Negotiated Fallback" (to Section 7.5(c)(iv))  Also, the term "Relevant Price" is used in the "Negotiated Fallback" definition. We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the Schedule when using "Negotiated Fallback" or whether we intend that "Fallback Reference Dealers" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e. the 4th fallback in our Schedule).

 Sometimes I have brilliant ideas and this may not be one of them.  Also, it would be nice if Jennifer had a singing role but I know how kids can be so don't you worry.  I'm not implying that Zachary shouldn't sing (or take on an acting role as well)  because that would be even better.  Or we could do a quartet.  Whatever. But you ,dahling, are the centerpiece here because Mother and Daddy like you best.  So here are my preliminary thoughts for an Irving Houston off-Broadway play.  Naturally this is based on an Ada & Mike premise.  (1)  This old suitcase  (Daddy packed the Louis Vuitton without wheels a WEEK early but Mother wouldn't let him close it and then it wouldn't close) (2)  Lovely Linda  (you remember Linda, don't you?) (3)  Hi Debba, Hi Sara  (what's the story, morning glory, etc. and of course this is the information hot-line and Mother's source of e-mail)  I'm sure I'll have many more brilliant ideas over the weekend but I wanted you to be the first to share these ideas with me.

 Janelle and Tom:  Ed Sacks and I need to speak with you in the a.m. about a few issues.  I have questions about market disruption because Con Ed has asked:  (1)  that Market Quotation apply rather than Loss (in the event of Early Termination) Is this a very liquid market?  ENA agrees to market quotation only for FX and short term deals in liquid markets (e.g., gas)  (2)  to jointly determine when a Market Disruption has occurred (after consultation) Usually ENA as the Calculation Agent makes this determination in good faith.  (3)  to identify two brokers/pricing platforms for purposes of determining the daily MTM Each party typically assesses its own MTM for valuation purposes (whether for collateral calls or termination, etc.).  Sounds like Ed and I need to know what was said to Con Ed about marking  (4)  I think Con Ed was headed in the direction of asking that we each provide dealer quotes (rather than ENA coming up with two quotes in good faith) as a Disruption Fallback.  Tom, I think we discussed this in a different situation.  Ed and I agreed to conference at 10 am Houston time to discuss these and the draft docs (which were e-mailed to you).

 Per:  I am told that Mark Taylor sent an email in December to Bob Shultz at EOL addressing the hedge fund issues (and CTA issues) associated with online trading and that you and Caroline received that email.

 Clem:  Per my voice mail,  please respond to the remaining issues raised by ConEd's lawyer:  (1)  "Guarantor agrees that its obligations are unconditional and will not be discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the Contract, [without setoff of the amount payable under the Contract] irrespective of any claims as to the Contract's validity, regularity or enforceability or the lack of authority of Enron to execute or deliver the Contract, or any change or amendment to the Contract (whether or not approved by or known to Guarantor).'  Response:  the bracketed language is unacceptable.  What about the bolded language?  (2)  "This Guaranty shall continue to be effective if the Guarantor merges or consolidates with or into another entity, loses its separate legal identity or ceases to exist."  Response:  not sure if this will remain effective if a merger occurs and therefore not binding (e.g., merger without assumption)  (3)  What are you looking for when requiring an "explanation of why such payment is due" in the demand section (paragraph 2)?  Is it to identify the type of default suffered by ENA?  Thanks for your response and I'll let you know if this particular guaranty is still a rush.

 Janelle:  I reviewed the email of 1/19/01 from Ben Chu.  There are only 2 items listed:  (1)  I will beef up the language to make it absolutely clear that ENA can select the price only if it hears from ConEd first.  (2)  I am not sure that I agree about the NY ISO changing pricing after 30 days.  We will need to discuss.  I have heard that this is not as frequent an occurrence as in the past and we are using the same mechanism as the ISDA procedure for change in prices.  (3)  Other than the foregoing, he had no other comments exept to say that he would review again.

 A few items to consider for the paralegals:  (1)  We need to organize the various country opinions (ISDA closeout netting, ENA jurisdictional survey, others) so that they are accessible to the group. We should also have a checkout process for the opinions.  We should have access to the ECTRIC opinion database (which I believe is organized online). I know that I can look in a particular file cabinet located near Susan for the various volumes of opinions, but where can I find an updated listing of all of the above?  (2)  Impress upon everyone the importance of entering information into Lotus Notes (for ALL types of agreements).  (3) I believe that Sam is in charge of the unanimous consents (for all Enron affiliates).  I for one would like an UPDATED book of the consents (kept updated).  These consents must be maintained and kept current.  If Sam is out of the office, we need access to the book.  (4)  We should create a "paralegal manual" as we go.  Each person could be responsible for drafting sections (and you could review their drafting skills!).  Given some time, I could probably help to identify relevant sections.  (5)  Agreement checkout.  We need to create a "checkout card" for each file so that when files are returned to the file cabinet, the checkout card is retired and placed inside the file for the next checkout.  I will volunteer my assistant to help out but I don't want to step out of turn here so I'll wait to hear from you.  (6)  I have the sense from some of the legal-credit meetings that everyone needs to be reminded to follow up on outstanding ISDA's (mainly the Top Ten and high priority items).  I'll send additional items as they occur to me.  Thanks.

 David:  In the midst of leaving my voice mail, I think I realized my error. I believe that a guarantor can be a "corporation,....entity" having total asssts exceeding $10million.

 Do either of you have a copy of the "Power of Attorney" which the four municipal utilities granted to Energy New England LLC?  I seem to recall a one or rwo paragraph document.  Thanks.

 Clem:  Just wondering if I could have a response today on Bear Stearns.  Gary Hickerson is anxioius to get this resolved today so that ENA can begin reducing margin rates with Bear.  Thanks.

 Ed & Brant:  I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE "represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.  Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?  Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.

 I received a call from Doug Sewall (midwest power) who wants to market this product to Canadian hydro utilities.  Doug says that the product is originating from David Hoog's group and is an "insurance" type product for generation outage.  Please let me know if anyone is familiar with this item.

 Stephanie:  The fax that you gave to me with this file states that the CP wants to change jurisdiction "back to New York."  I don't see a prior draft; only a blackline against a Weyerhaeuser Company LImited document, the latter ISDA having been executed in June, 2000.  Does his question refer to that executed master? If so, please let me know what we agreed to.  Thanks.

 John and Marc:  Legal needs your help!  As you know, Cargill and ENA are frequent trading partners.  We have never put a swap master agreement in place.  In this day and age, we would be negligent to not execute the swap master agreement  Cargill's legal department received a draft of our ISDA Master Agreement TWO MONTHS AGO.  I need your help to prompt the Cargill trader(s) to put some pressure on their legal department to negotiate the agreement with ENA.  The Cargill traders may call PHIL FANTLE.  Would you please make some calls and let me know who you speak with and when?  You can then give me a call or drop me an voice mail (Ext. 35620).

 Melissa:  Before I can respond, I need to know the following answers:  (1)  What is the Exercise Period (Commencement/Expiration Dates) for the swaption and during what hours can we exercise?  Is it from Jan. 2 - Feb 28, 2001 from 9 am to 11 am New York time?  (2)  Is the Commencement Date also the Premium Payment Date?  (3)  For early termination purposes, is there just a single Optional Early Termination Date or is it a period of time and during what hours?  (4)  Did we want to specify any Cash Settlement Reference Banks?  I can mark this confirm quickly when I hear from you.  Thanks.

 Sharon:  With respect to the ENE form of guaranty, we will agree to delete Paragraph 4 (setoff and counterclaims) in its entirety.  This is a major concession by ENE.  Can you now agree to the remainder of the ENE guaranty format?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

 Tanya:  There are a few issues left:  (1) [re:  legal name of our counterparty] According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named "First Union National Bank, Charlotte".  If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.  FUNB has asked that we forward the S&P document that you are looking at.  (2)  [re:  FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor] FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements. FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).  FUNB annual financials also available on EDGAR.  I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.  (3)  [re:  10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit Support] I don't know what the "usual haircut" is on these issues.  You said 90% or 95%.  Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we haven't discussed haircuts lately.  (4)  [re:  the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and Credit Event Upon Merger] FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).  If a Specified Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.  (I think that we have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve Transactions).  I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 I have engaged South African counsel.  The response may take a few weeks but your transaction can proceed prior to that time.  However, I will need some time to refine our ISDA Schedule and learn about the counterparty.  Please keep me up-to-date.  Thanks.  Sara  ps:  I can talk 
 Dee:  I am trying to hear from credit on about four issues, namely, the legal entity, need for First Union Corp. guaranty (due to the availability of financials), haircut on bonds and Specified Conditions.  I would then propose preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues.  If I hear from credit tomorrow (and I'm pushing), I could have the blackline by Wednesday and we could talk.  Hopefully, we'd be done by this week.  Hope this works.  Regards.

 Tanya:  Our legal group would like to schedule instructional seminars covering the ISDA Schedule, Credit Support Annex, omnibus and other forms and, specifically, the credit issues which arise in the preparation and negotiation of these documents.  Our thought is to eventually offer regular instruction every other month but we believe that initially we should offer monthly seminars.  In order to avoid "legal/credit Tuesday" boredom, we propose Wednesday or Thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date.  How does the week of February 19 or 26 sound?  I believe that we can circulate a "curriculum" of sorts to you or at the least a listing of topics.  Please let me know what you think.  As always, we welcome your suggestions.

 Richard:  This is a first for me.  I received the following objection to our standard arbitration language:  "The arbitration does not provide for expedited procedures with limited discovery and limited live testimony.   This could take as long as in court and cost more."  Is this a valid objection?  If so, how should we amend our language?  Or should we be silent as to jurisdicition without waiving any objections (venue, forum) and waive jury trial?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

 Mark:  Attached is my "short version" of Eligible Contract Participant (I would generally send to credit, new lawyer, etc.)  I am still uncertain about the status of the Trade Option Exemption (Issue 4); I understood from the conversation that you, Brent and I had that the old rules were out.  I have heard a different interpretation.  What is the status of this exemption under the new law?

 Darren:  (1)  Goldman Sachs ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.  (2)  UBS Warburg I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested execution of a "Client User List" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond with him (please send his email address), just let me know.  Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in place.

 Clem:  Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp. guaranty.  A few points:  (1)  Bear claims that the "cap" language which we typically include is inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount. I've not heard of this before.  I believe that they can send the treatise background info if you'd like.  (2)  The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with respect to the margin lending agreement.  Bear has added "performance" to the guaranty as a guarantor obligation.  ENA's account obligations pertain to the payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear. Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is essentially reduced to a payment of money).  (3)  Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should refer to Par. 5 to see their own version!  Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with Bear.  The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks.

A few things to note:  (1)  regarding "Procedures for entering into Transactions,"  my suggestion is that you consider a reasonable time period in which to respond upon receipt of a confirmation.  It is in both parties best interest to have an executed (and therefore enforceable) writing  This can be accomplished by under the NY General Obligations law by our agreement as to a "deemed response" if a party will not sign a trade confirmation.  (2)  regarding the concept of "Specified Transaction", ENA has reconsidered the earlier concession to exclude most Termination Events as Specified Conditions.  It is not ENA's position to unwind Transactions upon the occurrence of these events, and, therefore, each party ought to be able to rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions. Regarding the Credit Event Upon Merger, FUNB is protected with the amendment which we make to Section 5(b)(iv).  I hope that the blackline will resolve our outstanding issues.

 Cheryl:  Enron Credit Inc. , a  Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt trading currently handled by ENA.   As a result, ENA will need to transfer its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those brokers.  The brokers include our favorites:  Bear Stearns Companies Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. Goldman Sachs & Co.  ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001. Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the "sample package" (unanimous consent, authorized trader list).  Will you please see that an email is sent to Richard with this information?  We should begin the documentation now.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Randy:  Please forgive me for missing the call this morning.  I mistakenly thought that my 7:30 am doctor's appointment was tomorrow and not this morning.  Just a brief update to my resport of yesterday, Lynn, Brent and I are meeting this afternoon to discuss the Tozzini response and set plans for another trip to Sao Paulo to meet with the lawyers and refine the review.  I'll keep you briefed because I know that we're fast approaching year-end and Tozzini will be in a crunch.  We can discuss as the need arises.  Also, Lynn is preparing his synopsis regarding Don's recent inquiries about trading office locations.  Don's questions tie into the legal review of financial trading options in general but it's a good idea to address these up front.  Please call if you have any questions.

 Richard:  The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney for executing documents in Houston.  As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.  My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement and include the usual "affiliates, representatives, etc." who may need to know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, we should try to work from our form of NDA.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 I believe that there is a general consensus that Clem needs assistance to respond timely to  the mounting number of guaranties requested from Enron Corp.  In speaking with Clem, it seems that any evidence of increased and increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to obtain help.  Would your group be able to put together some facts and projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties? Since you are the first (and most important) point of contact for evaluating potential business, I think that your input would be extremely valuable for Clem to "plead his case."

 Tanya:  We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA world, we use "cost of funds plus 1%" as the default interest rate.  The Bear document provides:  "...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase until the date of payment of such excess."

 Anna:  I have not seen the executed Enron Corp. guaranty this afternoon and I'll check with Enron Corp. when we reopen for business.  We should talk first thing on Tuesday.  A couple of items:  (1)  The Securities Loan Agreement is between Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Enron North America Corp.  You requested The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. as the guaranty beneficiary (although that party is incorrectly stated as being party to the Securities Loan Agreement).  I just wanted to verify your preference and we may want to modify the first page to be accurate.  (2)  As you requested that I prepare the Schedules A and B, I ask the following:  (i)  as to Schedule A, please submit your notice information  (ii) as to Schedule B, we propose the default interest rate to be the Federal Funds Rate as defined in your agreement.  Please respond and we can finalize the agreement.  Please let me know if there is anything further you require.  Regards.

I do not have any memoranda addressing which choice of law would be binding on Enron Japan Corp.

 Bob:  Now there's the real reason!  If there are two new softs entities, then ENA and ECTRIC lose the netting benefits.  The tax issues are transparent (it's like the two credit derivative entities).  Who is involved from credit?  We need to discuss the structures with them because credit may be concerned about the loss of netting privileges.  Also, we need to verify that US entity softs trades will be USD based and the European softs entity will settle in Euro or GBP.  It seems obvious but a US entity could routinely settle in a currency other than USD.

 Susan:  The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated into the GTC's, I think we need a "universal" rep since the products could be traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.

 Janine:  Congratulations on your promotion!  I need an update on the back-office relationship between Enron Credit Inc. (ECI) and Enron Credit Ltd. (ECL) Does London confirm the ECI trades?  If so, I assume there is a power of attorney from ECI to someone in London.  Or will ECI trades be confirmed in the U.S.?  I received a call from someone in London inquiring as to whether Greg Whalley could sign for ENA because he was in London.  I believe this was in relation to the credit business.  Are U.K. traders booking credit deals in the name of ENA or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ENA? Any reason not to use ECI or ECL  here?  Also, can you send a copy of the services agreement (if any) between any companies performing services on behalf of either ECI or ECL?  Thanks.

 Sheila:  Just a few questions about this futures agreement:  (1)  Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and JP's affiliates? (2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return "property of like or equivalent kind or amount"? (3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or only "as agreed from time to time"?

 Susan:  You've just hit the nail on the head!  Remember, for FX trading ENA is always the principal, either in Houston, through EEFT as agent (under services agreement which I presume covers FX deals) or Enron Japan Corp. (under services agreement).  Most problematic are the counterparties since they could originate from anywhere in the world.  I have heard that Enron Japan had some GTC's that contained "universal tax reps" but I haven't checked it out.  Why don't you give me a call.

 Yes, my recollection is that Janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys in January, 2001.  I had conversations with David Adams and Grant Adamson but I can't recall if the swaption was ever executed.  I discussed the confirmation problem with David and noted that a small percentage of confirms were being marked  inconsistently (in Dec., 2000) after months of trading without any changes at all.  He was too busy to focus (and was a new lawyer, I think, which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus).

 With respect to Morgan, I believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect the parties' agreement to a forum other than a contract market (i.e., "AAA"), and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration, then the parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award punitive, exemplary or similar damages.   Because these are fairly old forms, I can't recall the reason for excluding this language.  I'll schedule some time on Monday for us to talk.

All transactions between ENA and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing should be subject to the existing ISDA between ERMS and Vastar Gas Marketing Inc., as amended.  The existing guaranty from Vastar Resources, Inc. applies to all trades through approximately  the end of this week  Who have you spoken with at Mirant as a follow up to our conversation of last Friday?  It appears that Mirant is trying to prevent trading until the new guaranty is in place.  Frank has contacted Mirant legal and are in agreement in principle as to the new guaranty from Mirant Corporation.  However, we understand that this entity  will be spun off in the near future and the credit could change substantially.  Have you given thought to the effect of the new guaranty?  Also, have we traded today with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing?  Online or offline?  We should talk to our traders about apparent authority and/or save tapes if we are having problem  Call.  We will negotiate a new ISDA in the next few months Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com    Edward Sacks/ENRON@enronXgate 03/07/2001 10:55 AM 
 All:  I have verified with CP that we do not want to stop financial trading between CP and ENA.  The immediate plan is as follows:  (1)  Immediate new guaranty from Mirant Corporation  (Frank to send draft in the a.m.)  (2)  Immediate amendment of the existing ISDA Master Agreement to replace Vastar with Mirant Corporation as the credit support provider (CP to send draft in the a.m.)  (3)  Immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be honored by CP and subject to the existing ISDA Master Agreement (I will prepare)  (4)  Review of the existing agreement to see if CP has issues (which we may consider).  If anyone has any questions, please let me knowl  Let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done.  Thanks.

 Tanya:  I have been reviewing some of Gary Hickerson's older master agreements which may require amending (to provide for multibranch transactions).  I wanted to verify which master we are relying on for UBS AG.  The files are a little confusing but it appears that we use the May 31, 1993  Swiss Bank Corporation master (and not the March 15, 1994 master with Union Bank of Switzerland).  Do you have any recollection of this?    Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com

If this can wait until Monday, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis (X35968) and get on my calendar early Monday.  If this cannot wait, please contact Mark Taylor (X37459) and he may be able to find a lawyer to assist you.  In general, I thought that Wendi was waiting to hear back from Cargill Incorporated credit.  Once we understood what Cargill was looking for, I was hoping to speak with their lawyer and agree to eliminate all of the provisions appearing in the draft POA which did not really concern ENA. Recall that ENA does not want to monitor Cargill's agent:  that's an internal job for Cargill.  I hope that we can speak on Monday.  Maybe you can coordinate tomorrow with Wendi.  Thanks.

 Mr. Geoffrey Pack;  Per Sarah Heineman's earlier discussion with you, Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") will shortly email to you the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.  We do not have ISDA boilerplate in word format and assume that you have such documents.  If not, please let us know.  We received internal credit information in mid-January.  Unfortunately, the derivatives legal group at ENA has been short staffed until very recently so we apologize for the delay in submitting draft documentation to you.  We did email the Enron Corp. form of guaranty to Michael Midden on 2/16/01.  We are currently working with Jay Williams (credit) to respond to any credit issues and John Suttle has transferred to our Australia office.

 Can you handle or should Carol? 
 (1)  I cannot speak with Caroline Abramo at 2.  Please call her and explain that I'm in the midst of  transaction which must close today (it may roll into Monday).  Tuesday is a safe bet.  Mention that the deal is being pushed by the 50th floor over here.  (2)  Did you call Stuart?  Just let me know and I'll call him when I get off this call. 
 I would like to take this as a vacation day.  Are there any conflicts? Thanks.  Sara 
 Sorry, Frank Sayre will call you or feel free to contact him (X57894). 
 Clem:  attached is the guaranty.  I'll call you soon.  SS 
 Cheryl:  Should you have any SEC issues (whether these are reps or forms to be completed, you should check with Travis or Lance (or anyone suggested by them).  As you may know, ENA has an affiliated registered broker-dealer (and that fact could be pertinent in some type of rep).  Thanks. 
 2:45 Houston time is fine for me. Also, the Trading Limitation language is NOT intended to kick in for intraday limit moves but only at the end of the day (i.e., "closing or settlement price").  We want the language to remain the same.  Hope this works.  Sara 
 Sorry for the mixup.  Attached is template for confirm and then the GTC (minus tax reps).  I'm trying to fit in the tax reps in between phone calls and will distribute to Susan Musch (tax) for review.  Stuart:  Who else should be on the review list?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kate: A few points about the last draft of the Agreement:  (1)  Par. 1(a):  the transfer and assumption is effective as of March 16, 2001 and not as of the Collateral Return  (2)  Par. 1(d):  the parties have already agreed to use one set of spreadsheets  (3)  Par.  3:  the ML&Co. guaranties are not being released because there are existing deals in place.  The guaranties will only be released as to the transferred Transactions  (4)  Par. 6:  conform language to side letters  (5)  Par. 8:  Please delete the last two sentences.  Enron will agree to be silent as to court actions, costs and attorneys fees.  Please call at 713-853-5620 (Sara) or 713-853-1794 (Janice).  Regards. 
 DONE.  Sara

 Susan:  This may look confusing!  It contains all of our "choices" for preparing the documents.  See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document which has our "choices" of tax forms.  I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues, etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.  We tend to not "think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft documents.

 Mark:  This is a chronic problem which I have addressed with Cheryl on more than one occasion (hence the email of this morning).  Her priorities are not currently with the swap group.  Also, Carol will not be a reliable backup for structured deals since Julia's group will demand more of her time.  I don't know what Angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute.  Last night we received notice of Yosemite IV and I'm hoping that Angela can cover. Alternatively, we may need to consider Frank, Francisco or Cheryl.

 Sara asked me to e-mail the attached to you.  Kaye 
 Russell:  I received your voice mail about the one (1) year financial trade done between ENA and CP.  The three-month limitation on trades is only an internal ENA control which was imposed by credit some years ago.  Please refer to Lotus Notes for a more comprehensive explanation.  The Master Agreement has been executed.  However, CP was unable to render a legal opinion vouching for "blanket" enforceability of the trades due to conflicting PUC orders which are still in effect today.  What is credit's position when your internal policy is violated?  Who was the trader?  Have you spoken with the trader?

 Here's a recap for everyone. Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear. However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.  Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the existing agreement to ECI.

 Stewart:  I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the other day.  Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the Tribe/lawyers a "sample ISDA without credit" which is not specific to the Tribe.  The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an "eligible contract participant" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.  Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance the purchase of the two dams.  Can you please address for West Origination and respond to Raleigh?  Thanks.

 Susan:  I've spoken with a new Indian tribe and need to send the "sample governmental ISDA" to several people.  I"ll forward the names/addresses to you.  Stewart Rosman is the commercial person and he should be copied as well as Tracy Ngo.  Please include the following message (verify the question I left for you) with the attachment:  "Per our recent conversation, please find attached a sample Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.  We will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit group has concluded its review.  You may already be familiar with the ISDA Municipal Counterparty Schedule and will note that although we are incorporating many of those provisions.

 Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge ENA.

 Hey, Jason:  Hope you're doing alright.  I received a call from NY and before I called back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks.  On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter (adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.  The child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam didn't see her.  Did you really get to know Samantha?  If so, and if you would like her home address, please let me know.

 Serge:  Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:  (1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about? Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?  (2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

 Maria:  I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a "position letter" to you when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.  Absent that information, it appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate fallback).

 Thank you for the e-mail.  I tried to contact you on your mobile several times in the last few minutes but I cannot get through.  Is there anyone besides Lauren who can help us in her absence?  I understand the GDRs were purchased and the account must be opened.  We cannot do anything without background documentation.  Also, we cannot find any information about the purchaser on the Enron corporate workbook.  Do you have a list of officers/directors?  You can call me at 713/853-5620.  Regards.  Sara 
 Martin:  How are things going?  In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form to provide for the "eligible contract participant" rep and line of business. I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted to ECTRIC.  Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC "know-it alls") and addresses many types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

 Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem. In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume.  Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations. Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian counterparties.  Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

 Andrea:  Would you please see that I am added to circulation of  the deal transaction list (containing trading deals)?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Cheryl:  1.  Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information.  2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.  Often, the broker will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs. This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.

 Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.

 All:  Effective March 19, 2001,  AESC and ENA entered into a "Side Letter Agreement" which is an ISDA Master Agreement from a legal perspective.  ENA and AESC have agreed this morning to negotiate and execute a new ISDA Master Agreement by April 13, 2001.  Until that date, however, we can confirm financial trades between ENA and AESC under the Side Letter Agreement. Attached below is a markup of an ISDA form of confirmation which contains language for these confirmations (the draft was prepared for Kim Hundl handling financial power).

 Cheryl:  Just a bit of history:  I think that the partial listing of officers on the (authorized traders) list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate officers and directors.  The ENA unanimous consent for the relevant company is the authority for document execution.  If, for example, a VP is authorized to execute for a particular company (by virtue of a corporate resolution or unanimous consent) and that particular VP's name does not appear in the partial listing, exection is not invalidated.  The execution is valid.  Have you had a broker question ENA's authority?

 Tanya:  Do we need to differentiate between the MAC as used in the CSA and in the Schedule (as an "Additional Event of Default") with respect to the disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based on your usage in power masters?  I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to trigger the MAC.  For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the question to credit?

 Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending their guaranty.

 Mark:  When you have a few minutes, I'm glad to discuss continuing "training" and balancing workloads. Mary has no one to unload Canada and structured transactions (Global Finance) since Carol does not have time for either.  Angela has no time for equity deals.  I think we need a backup for each.  Perhaps Anne Koehler fits the bill.  Or Cheryl.  Each of Anne and Cheryl need ISDA experience. I don't know Francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak with him and/or Mark Haedicke about his contined international workload. This could turn into a "Yao long term project."

 Yes, "eligible contract participant"  ("ECP") is an issue.  Both ENA and ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with oversight for derivatives).  As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI does have many executed ISDA agreements.  I do not know the volume of "omnibus" trades.  However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations in the annex.

 Holli:  EWEB's Board Resolution of December 5, 2000 permits financial hedging in general and authorizes:  "The General Manager or other authorized officers as noted in the Power Risk Management Guidelines to execute confirmations of transactions within the limits specified in the Power Risk Management Guidelines."  Each time ENA trades with EWEB, the trader must verify whether the EWEB trader is authorized under the then current version of the Power Risk Management Guidelines.  Each date you execute a trade:  (1)  you will need a list of authorized traders (authorized to enter into derivative transactions) certified by EWEB's secretary to be correct as of the Trade Date and (2) a statement certified by EWEB's secretary that the Transaction falls within the limits specified in the most current version of the Power Risk Management Guidelines, effective as of the Trade Date.  We have only a portion of the Power Risk Management Guidelines and it is dated April 19, 1999.  Our version is incomplete and probably outdated. Maybe EWEB will provide you with the current version.  It would be a lot easier if EWEB's resolution simply authorized it to enter into financial trades documented under the ISDA (which is what most resolutions permit).  However, EWEB did not obtain a broad resolution.  To Melissa, Sharen and Kim:  We should also verify that our confirmations contain these representations.  Please talk to me.

 ECT and Sonoco entered into a one- year "plastics" swap which terminated on March 31, 1999.  Doug Friedman (plastics trader) has asked that ECT formally demand $60,000 from Sonoco for underpayment on the swap.  Sonoco has claimed the existence of a Market Disruption resulting from price reformation in the plastics publication "Monthly Petrochemical & Pleastics Analysis" which caused it to use a differenct Floating Price calculation.  ECT disagrees as to the existence of such an event.  Doug will contact me this week to review our approach.  Please give me a call.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Karola Pearce (inhouse lawyer) just returned my call.  PG&E has created a NEW document (that is, we should ignore everything previously negotiated) and will FEDEX to us this week.  I hope we can negotiate the new document quickly.  Let me know if you have any questions. Sara 
 If the guaranty is capped at $15million and payment demands are  made by HPL and ENA that exceed the cap, full payment cannot be made.  Should the payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand, or do we care?  I hope this helps.  SS

 Yair:  Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining issues, including:  (1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is adequate.  (2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for dual confirms.  This is too confusing.  (3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too subjective.  The other changes were not substantive.

 Ellen:  I've reviewed WestLB's optional early termination language which is similar to the other's which I've reviewed (e.g., Goldman, Chase, Merrill, etc.). Here's how it works for your 3/26/01 - 3/26/21 swap:  (1)  March 28, 2011 is the "Break Date" or "Early Termination Date".  (2)  Either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on the day that is 5 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  By the way, this is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later disputed by the other party.  (3)  The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date.  (4)  Payment will occur on the Break Date.  (5)  I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date. There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to resolve.  (6)  If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation, then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business Days before the Break Date.  The confirm describes how the quotes are averaged.  A minimum of 3 quotes is essential.  Payment is still made on the Break Date.   George:  (1)  Please verify that the Break Date is 3/28/11.  My copy is a little fuzzy and the date could actually be 3/26/11.  (2)  I've marked the confirm and faxed it to you.  Please note that:  (a)  the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991 Definitions "as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time" (i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions).  There is a problem if  WestLB disagrees because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 "as is" since it is based upon the 2000 ISDA Definitions.  (b)  no need to say that the Calculation Agent is "as otherwise stated in the Agreement" because WestLB is stated to be the Calculation Agent in the Agreement.

No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

 All:  (1)  Joe and I have reviewed the Termination Agreement for Mercado and it looks fine.  (2)  I suggest that the following language be added to the bottom of a revised invoice (revised because the comment section which indicates the NF1164.Y is an annuity completed on 04/11/01 is inaccurate):  Mercado Gas Services, Inc. acknowledges that payment for Deal No. NF1164.Y is made in partial consideration of that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of April 5, 2001 by and among Mercado Gas Services, Inc., Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company and Enron North America Corp.  MERCADO GAS SERVICES, INC.  By:  _________________________ Name:  ______________________ Title:  ________________________  (3)  Joe and I have the following questions:  (a)  If the assignment to Williams was effective 4/5/01, why are we looking at figures from 4/9/01 and 4/11/01, respectively?  (b)  In lieu of (a) above, have ENA and Mercado already agreed to the numbers appearing on the invoice?

 Tracy, how is this:  Regarding the "Transfer" language for Allegheny (Party B), we have the following proposal:  "Party B may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate provided that (1) such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default, and (2) (i) the creditworthiness of the Affiliate is not materially weaker than that of Party B immediately prior to such transfer, unless Party B provides a satisfactory guaranty or credit support to the Affiliate, or (ii) the proposed Affiliate satisfies the criteria that Party A applies in deciding whether to offer or make an extension of credit or to enter into transactions similar to the Transactions subject to the proposed transfer."

 Jim and Rex:  The Lehman Bros. form of "put" works fine from a legal perspective. Yesterday, I faxed to you one of the "puts" with underlined language reflecting differences in securities language from our prior swap/forward deals with Lehman.  The differences may be alright for purposes of the "puts".  Please let Jeff know if the "puts" are acceptable for execution (from the securities perspective).  I have already initialed the documents from the swap perspective.  Let me know if you have any questions.  As usual, thanks for your help.

 Dick:  I am suggesting a minor change to the "Power Risk Management Committee" certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit "A").  If we leave the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit "A" is attached.  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 Tanya:  Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.  Sounds like he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) and Enron Industrial Markets ("EIM").  In the end, EIM was not the correct party but the Canadian party was the correct party.  Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by credit?  Is the company eligible?

 Carol:  Regarding a "hedge fund meeting" next week, I have spoken with most of the likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:  Fred Lagrasta Caroline Abramo Robyn Zivic Russell Dyk you Brent me  I believe that we have a mushrooming "process" issue.  I also believe that the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations are that all hedge funds need not be "last minute" deals, Caroline can be our ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.  Afternoon is best.

 Hi, Kristina:  It was great speaking with you last night!  Hope your dad is home and doing well.  I have contacted two different offices within Enron.  The first is Human Resources in Houston.  I suggested to them that you might be a good candidate for the associate/analyst program but they may think of other positions as well.  I don't know how quickly that office might respond so let me know. The second "office" is directly to London.  There is a woman in London named Anna Jansson who is currently leading efforts for the associate/analyst program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  I have spoken with Anna and she has asked that you visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and apply through the site.  She already knows your name and I am trying to fax your resume (business resume) to her as well.  When you visit the site, you may decide to use a different resume; just let me know.  Just in case you would like to call directly, Anna's number in London (dialed from the U.S.) is 011-44-20-7783-5912.  The company directory shows her email address as "anna_jansson@enron.net" (which looks a little weird to me).  Please keep in touch and let me know if you receive responses (or don't hear back) so that I can follow up internally.  By the way, you have an impressive resume.  Please feel free to call me at anytime.  I hope we get to meet soon.

 Caroline:  I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now. You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems to be similar to AIG).  This is all credit - but note his Additional Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.  You must discuss all of the items with your counterparty.  Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.

 Paul:  With respect to Valentis:  (a)  Does the MAC apply to both S&P and Moody's?  (not clear from worksheet) (b)  Are the financial covenants Events of Default or Termination Events?

 Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

 Melissa:  We agreed to the form of confirm with ConEd last night.  Michael Forte was to send the redraft to Michael Brown.  I haven't seen it yet.  Sounds like there will be a plain vanilla swap also, which should look like (format) the one we did in January.

 Chris:  We should chat.  Per the ISDA, ENA is the calc agent and we have already agreed to usual Market Disruption Events and fallbacks in the ISDA.  If you want to change the ISDA agreement, then we can consider the items which Merchant has included in the draft.  As calc agent, we should create a draft and send the form to you for review. However, I do need you to explain/verify Floating Price B.  And verify rounding convention which differs from our standard.  Please call to discuss.

 Thanks for your help.  I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that he worked on the transaction.  The name "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" ("Stadacona") does not appear on the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.

 Susan:  Laurel Adams has an FX deal where RMT must be a party.  The counterparty is a 100% owned Enron sub named "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona".  When I last checked, nothing shows up in the corporate database.  However, I have verified the name, ownership, etc.  with Jeff Blumenthal.  I will separately email you the counterparty info that I have.  We need a deemed ISDA for the parties.  We should later do the ISDA when the information is available on the database (which could be any day, I suppose).  I would just use our standard RMT format.  Please assign.

 Mark:  Can you "publish" a list of swap attorneys and their primary/secondary areas of responsibility (for at least the lawyers to use)?  I'd like to direct random requests to the appropriate people.  For example, is Brent the only "weather attorney"?

 Brent:  It's a weather question.  Looks like Carol asked Susan or Stephanie to let Celeste know if weather trades were possible (she thought it was).  If weather is a commodity, I guess it works but you'd probably need to inocorporate ISDA terminology and your definitions, etc.  Check the blue file - you'll see Carol's email.

 Dick:  I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to each trade confirmation.  We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This will be the format for all future transactions.  Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.

 Dick:  That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation (marked Exhibit "A") to each of your certificates since that is how each certificate is drafted.  Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.   Please call if you have any questions.

 Mary:  Remember, this is the swap that you finally decided to go ahead and terminate yourself.  There was much confusion about how many S.A. swaps actually exsited (only one) and after sorting through the mess, when I asked if you had estabished a Raptor "format for termination", you decided to do the drafting.

 Sharon:  I didn't have your phone or fax numbers to keep you in the loop so I am sending this email by way of explanation.  You may recall that Anna Meytina and Cheryl Nelson negotiated one or more agreements between the Bear companies and Enron Credit Inc.  These documents included the above referenced $25 Million guaranty.  I understand that our respective commercial groups have agreed to an increased guaranty cap ($100 Million).  I have learned that Anna is on vacation.  I don't know which Bear lawyer will look into this recent guaranty development so I hope that you will advise us in that regard.  Effective May 15, 2001, Enron Corp.  executed an amendment to the March 29, 2001 guaranty to increase the guaranty cap.  I have faxed a copy of this amendment to both Bill Carik and Cheryl Lewis.

 Janine:  First Union National Bank ("FUNB") entered into a credit derivative trade with ENA effective 20 April 2001 (our trader was a London trader).  Although ENA has a Master ISDA Agreement  with FUNB (the "ISDA"), this does not appear to be the impetus for the booking since the confirm didn't reference the ISDA.  Is ENA alright confirming trades in this manner?

 Karolina and Rod:  This swap has ended up on my desk!  Imagine that.  This transaction ought to be booked between RMT and ETOL.  The existing ISDA Master Agreement from December 31, 1998 is between Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. and ETOL.  We need to create an RMT/ETOL ISDA Master Agreement for this 3-year rate swap.  Is ETOL prohibited from entering into swaps with other parties, such as RMT (under the terms of the lending documents)?  Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.

 Susan:  Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.  Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?  Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal be booked in ENA rather than RMT?  Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms  Thanks..

We ask that you blackline that language in a final blacklined document for us to review.  We need to execute the ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA") now.  I understand that Joe Limone and Brent Hendry have been discussing contingent call options and related documentation.  ENA would like to incorporate these potential trades and other transactions under the new ISDA  If you prefer, ENA would be glad to take over the drafting of the ISDA. Please let me hear from you.     Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com

 John:  Marie gave me your message.  I will call you after lunch to discuss Total.  The Marval firm in B.A. is ENA's outside legal counsel for derivatives advice.  ENA lawyers hire and speak with ENA's outside counsel. I have spoken with our outside counsel on derivatives issues in Argentina.  I will discuss this further with you when you and I have our conversation. Sara 
 Bill and Tanya:  I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit Authority).  I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master Agreement with MARTA.  We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001. Until we resolve the "capacity" or "authority" issue, there is significant legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.  I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.

 Mae Charles:  Attached is the form of legal opinion which Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") submitted to M.A.R.T.A. (together with ENA's draft ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex).  As we discussed, ENA will now be requesting this opinion from you.  ENA has prepared and submitted a trade confirmation for the recent financial swap to M.A.R.T.A.   Other than this document executed by ENA and awaiting execution by M.A.R.T.A., no instruments have been executed by the parties. If you need to see the terms and conditions of the trade, please let me know.  I look forward to speaking with you early next week.  Regards.

 Nikki:  I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.  ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.  I ask that you please advise me of the following:  (1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?  (2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?  (3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the review/execution of the attached assignment?  Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

 Cheryl:  Attached are Welch's comments.  As you already know, Jennifer is doing the 2-month deal (but no others until the ISDA is inked).  We do have to investigate the coop issue under Michigan law.  Both the swap CP and the parent have the word "cooperative" in their names.  Please see Lotus Notes.  You should send an immediate email to the department to see if anyone has used Michigan counsel (I saw a single reference in the Jurisdictional Database).

 Hey Sam, that has to be one of the "cheeriest" cards I've ever received. Please thank Leica for her birthday wishes (and how is the old girl doing?). Do you remember my 39th at Andrea's with Pat and Dee (I think) and Ron and his wife (I've forgotten her name but I remember what she looks like)?  I remember your 40th with Beverly and Helen and the walker (you probably remember the stripper).  I need your MAILING address so that Phoebe, Chloe and I can send you a holiday card.  Are you a bi-city resident?  Do you still own Corky's?  Do you have a different venture(s)?  How is Mr. Casey?  How are Helen and Beverly?  Do you see them often?  Do you love Atlanta?  You know that at my age (it's actually been any my ages) I write in stream of consciousness.  I hope this makes sense.  Sara  P.S.  Ain't life grand? 
 Susan:  I just spoke with CSFB and entered contact info into Lotus Notes. Can I re-review the draft Schedule please?  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com

 Mark:  Attached is my current workload report.  I'm beginning to get nervous about meeting traders' expectations as I am taking vacation from June 14 - 22 (seven business days) and I don't know who will be able to pick up my emergencies and routine issues.  I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression that Brent is constantly busy with weather.  I'd like to briefly discuss Cheryl's workload  I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is "project" oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.  FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage agreements only.  The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to "cleanup" the agreement status.  It should be winding down.  I have encouraged Cheryl (as have Frank and Mary) to provide you  with a workload report since we really want her to be trained in the swap basics.  Also, I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell, you and me before I leave (topic is online trading of credit derivatives). Currently, only ECL is offering the bankruptcy default swap online (and no one is hitting the product).

 SUPER CONGRATULATIONS!  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I am currently reviewing.  Jeff H. will respond re: necessity for Fallback. SS 
 this is the latest paper deemed ISDA.  Please mark for content against OUR deemed ISDA.  Thanks.  SS 
 I've been thinking about your query and in the interim, I find that David is very conscientious and does not let outstanding issues linger. He also seems quite eager to learn.   As I continue to work with him, I am glad to keep you updated if you remind me periodically.  Sara 
 I am still waiting for my Brazilian visa (another single entry, unfortunately).  It should arrive next week.  I was hoping to spend the week of Sept. 5-11 in Sao Paolo but that is impossible to plan without the visa. Maybe the latter part of that week or the next week will work.  If I arrive on a Sat. or Sun., what do you think about the two of us meeting over the weekend to work out a plan?  I can then devote all of my time to dealing with Tozzini on the physical and financial issues and working with originators to explain financial trading procedures.  I will need to determine if Jose Emilio (on the physical issues) and Antonio Felix and Renato (on the financial issues) will be available to meet during my trip.  I have sent them e-mails to at least pose the question.  I know that you are very busy.  Please let me know what you think about my proposal.  Also, I apologize for asking you to give up any of your weekend time.  Maybe you have another suggestion that will work better for you.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 You are fantastic!  It looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to BA around 9/12 with a longer stopover in Sao Paulo several days later which could last until 9/25 or the end of September.  Will I have the visa before then?  SS 
 No, we insist that the trader make credit aware of new counterparties or unusual trades or opportunities prior to transacting.  Credit reviews trades each morning and they know what's going on.  ss    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please let me know if you never received.  I had this hand delivered to you on Friday.  ss 
 I just received a message from Anna Chung (?) at Merrill re: the ENE master. Her number is 212-449-7494.  I also left vm for Jeff to send down deemed ISDA's or other confirms.  SS 
 Susan:  The docs are in my "in box".  I haven't reviewed and need to speak with Sheila (or have you already contacted her?).  I don't know the timing for this transaction.  How long will it take to open the account?  Feel free to grab the docs.  SS 
 Susan:  Based on Tanya's message, we should pursue the Morgan Cap Services agreement.  Let's talk when you have a chance. I've put this on our legal.credit list.  SS 
 Mark:  In connection with Susan F.'s departure, could you please provide a copy of her "project list" so that we can follow up on finalizing/redistributing her workload?  I have lots of questions which I'm sure can't be answered this minute, such as:  Shouldn't we help to prioritize her work?  Will she continue day-to-day work?  Who will take confirm desk calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be involved now), etc.  Please let us know when you'd like to "regroup".  Thanks.  Sara 
 Here's the email!  And thanks for your help this morning.  Sara 
 please print the xcel document.  SS 
 Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming along.  When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA? Please let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you in any way.  I understand that our respective traders are discussing a transaction.  You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be on vacation from October 6- 13.  Also, the ENA lawyers will be offsite October 5 and 6. Should you need assistance during my absence, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis at Ext. 35968 who will direct you to a lawyer. Thanks.  Sara 
 All:  I will be on vacation until October 16, 2000.  Because I am handling a large number of brokerage agreements and electronic trading platforms (for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.), I have asked Jason Peters with Andrews and Kurth (713-220-4124) to assist me.  Some of the agreements are for John Greene who is currently in London and those agreements may reference English law and the Financial Services Acts.  I have given Jason your names IN CASE he has any questions.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Muni's and other public entities (state, local and federal) are the type of counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc.  If we cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable (i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).  We definitely need to review certified copies of  the counterparty's charter, enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of which we always provide to the counterparty).    It's best to execute the ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.  Call if you need further help.  Sara     Enron North America Corp. 
 I spoke with Marsha Greenblatt (Sempra's trading lawyer).  She was unaware of any issues with Sempra's dealing with ECTRIC but recognized that (i) this is a credit decision and (ii) trading with ECTRIC has occurred.  Sempra does have a London trading operation so maybe the London traders for both of our respective companies have been transacting.  Of course, all confirms she reviewed were with ECT/Sempra (except for one or two ECTRIC confirms).  Based upon our recent ECT/ECTRIC internal conversation, I don't anticipate further confusion.  Thanks for everyone's attention to this matter.  Sara 
 I thought we sent it but I'll have Marie Heard email a copy right away.  SS 
 Thanks for remembering me (even though I FORGOT to send you birthday wishes last month).  It doesn't seem like a year, does it?  Hope you're doing great and your family is well.  How's the HOUSE OF THE CENTURY coming along?  I recall looking at the plans just "yesterday".  Stay well (and young).  Sara 
 Attached is the latest "redraft" of guidelines based upon my conversation with Brent (who has not yet seen the attachment).  Let's discuss these tomorrow.  I'll conference you at 9 am.  Thanks.  Sara  Lynn:  I'll forward separately Brent's proposed paragraph for the Houston trader. 
 Here's Brent's other paragraph. 
 Per our conversation.  Sara 
 Yes, I'll get to it today.  I've already spoken with Jared.  SS 
 Please!  Sara 
 Hi Christian!  I wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of negative pricing on the west desk.  I'm getting a differenct response on the east desk.  Although my interest is financial trading, you may have experieced this issue on the physical side (Jeff Hodge has not).  In the past on the west desk financial trading, any prices which are negative are deemed to be "0" (so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes).  The east desk wants to add in the negative numbers.  Please call me to discuss. I'd really appreciate it.  Sara 
 Can you recall if the trades (west desk) were swaps or puts?  SS  ps  I'm still trying to resolve 
 ADDENDUM:  I received a phone call from the Sempra lawyer this afternoon. She said that Sempra has no problems trading with ECTRIC. 
 no 
 Marie:  Wisconsin's lawyer is out of the office until Nov. 29.  Would you please follow up with respect to the ISDA which we sent to him on Nov. 5?  I left your name and phone number on his voice mail.  Cary is interested in pursuing this counterparty.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Can we conference on Tuesday, November 23?  Anytime after 10:30 am CST works.  Or anytime on Wednesday, November 24 before 3pm CST.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - I called in for the meeting this morning but no one else ever connected.  Sorry.  I have nothing new to report.  I'll be in S.P.  next week for a few days.  I'll try to get on your calendar.  Thanks.  Sara  P. S.  Happy Thanksgiving! 
 Please explain or handle.  thanks.  SS 
 consider it cancelled.  ss 
 Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent "short list" of possible products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future. The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week. My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara 
 The Tozzini lawyers will meet with us to discuss prior memoranda and products for trading.  For those in Houston who wish to be conferenced in, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis in Houston (X35968) who will make arrangements.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please follow up on NY Elec & Gas because they'll never call back.  SS 
 Carol:  Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus Notes entry).  Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.  Tanya knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is unacceptable so CP has a MAC).  We expect their outside counsel to have some comments which we haven't yet seen.  Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand delay).  Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).  Marie has the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.  Our discussion today was general.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail!  Debra please follow up.  Call Marie if you have any questions.  Sara 
 I'll be back in the office on Friday, Dec. 3.  Kaye Ellis can reach me in the Sao Paulo office.  thanks.  SS 
 Chris and Tracy:  I will be in the Sao Paulo office most of this week.  You can reach me there (check with my assistant Kaye Ellis) or you can call Marie (X33907) and she will make certain that a lawyer is available to help you. Thanks.  Sara  Marie:  Please assist Chris and Tracy as required.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye:  did you handle?   Thanks.  Sara 
 I'll be in Sao Paulo this week.  You still didn't send me a mailing address. SS 
 Attached is my feedback.  Sara     Cullen Duke @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/19/99 02:48 PM 
 Thanks for the help.  Could you please call Chris?  Sara 
 I think that Carol may have looked at this several months ago.  Isn't this related to the request of Jean Mhra?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please revise now.  Thanks. SS 
 Prior trades already confirmed last week.  Sorry. 
 Is this the deal we lost? Please tell me what you know.  ss  p.s.  Welcome back. 
 The disappearance of a price index is a "Market Disruption Event" discussed in Section 7 of Annex A to the confirmation.  Unless an "Alternative Floating Price Source" is described in the confirmation, the Floating Price on the first available Trading Day (without a disruption) is utilized if the disruption does not exceed three Business Days; otherwise, the price is "determined in good faith by Company, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."  At the moment, your confirm does not identify alternative pricing. 
 There are a few credit issues here.  I have a 9:30 am call with Cargill.  SS 
 I just sent a fax to Chip Rainey.  No attachments.  Thanks.  SS 
 FYI 
 El Paso is a "high volume" CP with an existing ECT Master.  Marie, there is a 9/1/99 note in Lotus Notes that the CP to email its form of Schedule. What have we received?  Shouldn't we be pushing this ISDA?  Can someone prepare credit? 
 This is a "high volume" counterparty.  Shouldn't we be pursuing an ISDA to replace the existing ECT Master?  Susan, your last entry was 3/9/99.  SS 
 This is a "high volume" trading counterparty.  Shouldn't we negotiate an ISDA to replace the existing master?  SS 
 Jeff:  I thought we should update the situation particularly in light of the problems that Willie runs up against.  Can you give me a call and let's discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Did you understand my message?  Please give me a call.  S 
 The east and west power desks are creating slightly different floating price language for some of the power pools.  The west desk wants "negative prices" to be averaged in as "zeroes"; the east desk wants to average in all prices "positive or negative".  I'm inclined to let the traders do as they wish.  I can't seem to get an explanation for the difference in approach (in each instance ENA may take either side of the deal).  The confirm desk will have to pay attention to the source of the confirms to use the correct pricing language.  I don't know if this will create an on-line trading issue.  What do you think?  Sara 
 Are we still on for a lunch at the Big G tomorrow?  I'm flying to NO in the morning.  Your voice mail didn't pick up on your phone this morning (504/898-1909).  Please call and I'll even try you again.  Sara  713-853-5620 
 attached is the form.  no premium.  Also, we need to use that introductory paragraph about "mutual promises, etc," 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow.  Please have the call if you think it necessary.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm checking into to provide help.  SS 
 Per my voice mail.  Also, for YOUR use, I am attaching a "form" of gas tolling agreement.  Brent also has a "confirmation" related to a master.  Let me know if you've already handled.  Thanks.  SS 
 Per David's request, I'm attaching a (very old) form from Houston, not often used here anymore.  I'm not sending this directly to David (if only to avoid "form shopping"). Let me know if I can be of further assistance.  Thanks. Sara 
 I just spoke with Lawyer Burlingame and we're on for lunch.  My flight arrives at 10:45 and I'll drop off my bag and head for Galatoire's.   Look forward to seeing you.  ss  P.S.  My dad would like to treat us to lunch using "his waiter" who I think is named Michael. 
 In my absence on Friday, Dec. 10, please contact Susan Flynn (X30975) with any questions.  Sara 
 It seems that Miriam Radach has been transferred to Sherman & Sterling's Washington D.C. office.  She is working with a NY associate named Jennifer Kumble.  The lawyers had a lot of issues to discuss with Tiger and should give us comments next week.  Have a nice holiday!  I'm going to Baton Rouge to watch the tigers (LSU!) play ball.  Sara 
 This is FYI only since I'll be out tomorrow.  I have never spoken with Bruce.  Nothing will happen tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Bruce:  I'm out of the office tomorrow but will be back Monday.  Let's talk then please.  Sara 
 Doug:  Per our conversation, will you please forward to me and Sami a copy of the recent tolling agreement?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark and I met with Mark Haedicke regarding utilities and the need for a legal opinion from the utility counterparty.  We have agreed with Mark as follows:  1.  Our negotiations with investor owned utilities should be based upon our standard ISDA Schedule (ISDA Multicurrency Agreement) AND including the "Additional Termination Event".  Neither party should be required to provide a legal opinion.  2.  Investor owned utilites will be approved for online trading from a legal viewpoint.  The extra "Additional Termination Event" paragraph is not currently included in the GTC's but COULD be incorporated if there is a revision to the online agreement.  3.  Our position with respect to municipals/municipal owned utilities, federal/state/local owned utilities and cooperatives remains unchanged.  We should still utilize and update the "municipal ISDA" form, and, require a legal opinion from the counterparty.  In that regard, Susan Flynn has been working on an "omnibus" format for an electric co-op (Deseret Generation and Transmission Co-operative), an earlier version of which could be used as a template for a municipal omnibus confirmation. 
 FYI - just in case.  SS 
 I have no changes from last week.  Sara 
 Call me anytime today.  713/853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Good to hear from you!!!  I'm looking forward to hearing about your stay in Brazil.  Are you back in Houston?  Let's have lunch.   Sorry about the guide.  It sounds like a larger, well established hotel will have the edge on tourism information.    Michael Herman @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
 ENA booked a July-August, 2000 deal with this counterparty.  Is this company a municipal?  Have you agreed to governing law and arbitration?  SS 
 I think it's the first doc.  Check the "Re" for the deal number.  Thanks. Sara 
 I spoke with John Nassos.  He said that the company just hired a treasury/credit person last week (and that was the holdup on negotiating the ISDA).  Mr. Nassos has my phone number and all I can do is wait to hear from him or his outside counsel.  Sara 
 Let's catch up when you're ready.  1.  Received NEW draft from Pacific Gas & Electric.  Need to do ISDA comparison. 2.  Susan is out JUNE 1 and "Columbus Dispatch" needs to be finalized.  We sent blackline Friday afternoon.  Details will happen Tuesday morning. 3.  Let's talk. 
 Per my voice mail, you can see the floating price index language (power and gas) that I need.  Please email or fax so that I can insert it into my draft confirm.  Thanks.  Sara 
 please print these for me.  thanks.  ss 
 Danny:  I did not recieve new documents last night.  When can I expect something?  Sara 
 I wanted to sent you a holiday card but, alas, the mysterious Sam has no address.  I guess I could send it to your lessee in the Big Easy (remember, the doctor living in the marina) but he may not appreciate the beauty of the card.  Please email your address.  Hope you had a "Happy Chanukah".  I was in BR to celebrate with my family - Jennifer is 15 and Zachary will be 13 on January 1.  My parents are slowing down but Deb and Steve are not.  Deb ordered some brisket and latkes from the 2nd Ave. deli in NY and the food was awful.  Sara 
 I haven't heard anything further about this deal.  Attached is a framework for future revision.  SS 
 yes 
 Attached is a draft of a swaption based upon the term sheet reviewed the other day.  Elizabeth has not reviewed yet and I still have some lingering questions.  ss 
 This is scheduled to close on Friday (don't know what time).  It's Gareth's deal.  Enron Corp. is swap CP with a trust.  Don't know who is signing for Enron Corp.  Please C me to discuss and raise logistical issues.  Thanx.  SS 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 Are you OK with this deal?  I may have a few questions.  SS 
 I don't know who's working on this deal, so I'm forwarding docs to you all. Tax reps look ok to me.  [see Total Return Swap Confirmation - Sec. 3.2; Schedule - Part 5(l) and requirement that swap counterparty which is Enron Corp. deliver IRS 'Forms 1001 or 4224].  Please leave me voice mail or email.  Thanks.  Sara  ps.  this closes Friday morning 
 Please confirm the Enron Corp. account for the swap:  Citibank ABA #021000089 A/C = 0076486 
 I think that this transaction is called "Project Moosehead".  I have a meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS 
 RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise today to send in the morning.  CP is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.". Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal.  Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes on.  SS 
 Let's cancel.  OK? 
 I'll send you a brief comparison of the ERMS/Merrill ISDA from 1992 with ENA's typical ISDA used in 1999 by the morning.  Am currently working to produce the confirm format.  SS 
 Looks fine to me.  SS 
 Please make sure that I am on the distribution list for ALL documentation.  I only have the swap confirm/schedule.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a brief comparison of differences. 
 This is the doc for revision.  We need it asap.  Thanks.  SS 
 Please verify fax number for Enron Corp., VP Finance and Treasury (for the purpose of receiving notices of default)  713-646-4016 
 Please put on my calendar.  SS 
 Please print asap.  Thanks.  ss 
 no, not yet 
 2,3 and 4 
 Mike means "Mark Taylor".  Would you please let me know if Mark wants me to finalize.  Thanks.  ss 
 The Schedule calls for the exchange of Tax Certificates, being IRS Form 1001 (your latest revision). 
 The ISDA Schedule calls for the delivery of IRS Form 1001. 
 I will not be able to make the call tomorrow.  Sara 
 FYI 
 This is the deal that Susan F.  worked on on Friday.  I'll forward the Schedule to you.  No one is asking for a revised Schedule yet but we should make the change and email  the parties on Susan's email so that everyone knows the latest changes and then ask if anyone has comments.  ss 
 Here's the message I just referneced.  ss 
 Lynn:  Weren't you going to take a look at the Trader Guidelines for Argentina?  Let me know if you have any questions or if I can help you further.  Thanks.  SS 
 Could you please print.  ss 
 Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).  I haven't heard any details.  It was originally planned to close after X-mas but maybe it will happen in the next few days.  FYI - I'll be out of the office after X-mas until next year.  SS 
 The account number in the confirmation is correct.  Please add "without duplication" language to the Floating Amount calculation. 
 I normally wouldn't forward these messages but this is funny! 
 per vm 
 see Part 5 (l) 
 I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.  I would say for the most part that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers understand our position.  Big issues:  arbitration (I need an explanation in order to go to our general counsel) Limitiation of Liability  All else is negotiable.  SS 
 Enron Corp. has NOT agreed to: 1.  Credit Event Upon Merger 2.  Added Payer reps (or other tax related changes) 3.  Waiver of Jury Trial  I think Barclays may back down from the Cross Default changes. Sheryl wants to stet her changes to "Automatic Early Termination." Sheryl does need to see the other Ghost template changes.  Call if you have any questions.  713-853-5620  Sara 
 With respect to Part 2, Tax Reps and Part 5(l) deletion, the Enron Corp. tax group is fine with the changes (although these are not necessary).  Also, Enron will deliver forms as Barclays wishes.  Let me know if you have any questions. Sara 
 Scott,  Attached are the guidelines for Buenos Aires.  - - - Sara 
 Attached is the latest draft of the "Daily Call Option" confirmation between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  This is the same draft that Rodney received on Friday, Dec. 17. 
 1.  The Enron company is "ENA" 2.  How many Calculation Periods will there be?  December is a short month if the Transaction begins on 12/25/99.  Will the first payment be due  in early January?  If you intend three (3) payments to be made, then the Calc. Periods are from 12/25-12/31, January, 2/1-2/22. 3.  Is this a 24-hour index or is it limited to peak hours as defined by CAMMESA?  I left a message for Joe Hunter (confirmation desk - Ext. 33316) to be prepared for this Transaction.  Brent:  would you please verify the Floating Price?  Thanks. 
 Just to be certain that the EES entity that might enter into the swap is eligible, you should verify that it (1) has total assets in excess of $10 million or (2) has a net worth of $1 million and enters into the swap agreement in connection with the conduct of its business or to manage the risk of an asset or liability owned or incurred in the conduct of its business or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred in the conduct of its business. 
 fyi 
 Since the Master is drafted for ECT/TBS, what does your message mean in terms of moving the ISDA, guaranty and side letter along?  As I mentioned to Ted, what EI or an EI project company does outside of the ECT swap is not something that I can track.  Thanks.  SS 
 I have been unable to reach Ana Sonia by phone as she has not returned to t= he=20 office and has not returned my telephone calls.  So, we are preparing=20 execution copies of the ISDA and will have these signed by ENA.  We will fa= x=20 and Federal Express these to EDEN with a cover letter explaining to fax the= =20 signature page back, when they can expect the Enron Corp. guaranty and when= =20 we can expect their opinion of counsel.  I will also explain this to Ana=20 Sonia by separate fax.  I just spoke with Jeff Kable and explained this to= =20 him.  Susan Bailey is here all day but she is out next week (and I am out= =20 next week as well).  However, Marie Heard will help out next week.  Let me= =20 know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Automatic Termination Provision:  If the legal opinion required to be delivered by Counterparty pursuant to Part 3 of the Schedule to the Agreement is not delivered to ENA by December 29, 1999, then this Transaction shall automatically terminate on December 29, 1999 without further action or payment required by either party. 
 I did speak with Ana Soria.  Her only concern was the legal opinion.  I faxed her the format for the legal opinion and attached a cover sheet which indicated that ENA must receive the executed opinion by the close of business on December 29.  I've attached a copy of the fax cover sheet.  Also, Joe Hunter has added the "Automatic Termination" provision into the confirmation.  Have a happy holiday.  Sara 
 Pending execution of a master agreement, Amoco transactions continue to be documented under the omnibus.  Willie has brought to my attention three issues which continue to be raised by Amoco:  1.  Procedures for entering into Transactions: deletion of response within 2 Business Days after receipt of confirmation and failure to respond as conclusive evidence of Transaction  2.  Setoff:  there doesn't seem to be an "Affliliate" issue but I'm not certain of their comment to setoff applicable against a "derivative amount" (are they attempting to prevent setoff against physical amounts owing? or only trying to clarify that unpaid "derivative amounts" can be setoff against other amounts due?)  3.  Choice of law:  change to NY  I thought you could address these issues in your negotiations and let Willie know how to handle.  I've left confirm in your office.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I should be in immediately after my 8:30 am appointment.  Sara 
 Attached is the most recent draft of the guidelines.  Please let me have your comments.  Sara 
 Happy New Year, and, did we ever do a back-to-back (RMT/Enron Comercializadora Argentina) deal for this transaction? 
 I just received this message from Mark.  Let's talk and I can see what I can do.  I'm not aware of any written broker agreements used by ECT for trading other than those for futures and equities.  I can check on the physical side.  SS 
 Mark, we should rotate the desk (as per this email).  Shall I speak to the group or would you prefer to do it?  SS 
 Here's the original blackline.  Leave me a voice mail with the names and I'll revise my latest blackline today so that we can satisfy Cargil.  SS 
 see the doc below for making revisions.  ss 
 Attached is the form of guaranty (blacklined to the draft that Russell sent in early December) with my comments and Clement's comments.  Let's discuss and forward to Cargill.   SS 
 Happy New Year! Attached is a new draft of the Enron Corp. guaranty which incorporates Andrzej's comments of Dec., 1999 based upon exchanges with Russell Diamond (Enron credit - physical).  Tanya Rohauer (Enron credit - financial) is faxing Andrzej a copy of this guaranty as well. I need to catch up on our previous discussion regarding the Schedule; you should have received a draft of our Credit Support Annex just before the holidays.  I will touch base with you in a few days.  Sara 
 Deseret (omnibus) Empresa  Thanks.  ss 
 Per my voice mail, attached is the redlined version.  See Paragraph 4. Thanks.  ss 
 Attached is a draft SP 15 on peak confirm which you may send to Delano.  SS 
 Would you please give me a call to discuss the legal opinion.  After 10 am Houston time is fine.  Happy New Year.  SS 
 I have an 8:40 am eye doctor appointment tomorrow morning.  SS 
 Please have the attached guaranty executed.  SS 
 We received your lease information yesterday afternoon and will call early next week.  Sara 
 check  font size 
 Would you please supply me with the notice information required on page 4 of the draft Schedule.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be unable to conference on Jan.11.  I have no news to report other than we are finalizing Argentina financial trading guidelines.  Sara 
 Email Tambra for the remaining information.  SS 
 I shouldn't be too late.  ss 
 Joe:  see the attachment for a draft confirm. Pat:  Here's Julian's proposal. 
 Follow up from Brent - 
 Attached is a draft list of items for review.  Some of the items require immediate document  revisions; others require policy decisions before revising the documents.  Please edit and refine.  Mark suggested that we confer and come up with specific recommendations.  Once we create a list, let's try to meet on one or more occasions to discuss.  SS 
 Is anyone interested in joining me for Portuguese lessons?  Do you know anyone else who might be interested as well?  Sara 
 ENA has been negotiating an ISDA with Statoil.  I was advised by Chuck O'Brien this morning that Statoil also trades with ECTRIC and that he received an omnibus confirm from ECTRIC this morning.  Statoil will not sign the omnibus but would like to put an ISDA in place with ECTRIC and have the trade subject to that ISDA.  ENA should finalize its ISDA soon.  Would ECTRIC like to duplicate?  Happy New Year!  Sara 
 I hear that a binding agreement and/or PPA was signed with MOEMA for a 10-year transaction.  Do you have an English version of the MOU or PPA? Details?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Pat:  Do we need to talk? 
 Here's the confirm 
 Here's the attached termsheet 
 FYI:  Enron South America has requested a new account for CIESA deal.  I'm also forwarding Bruce's message which requests 2 accounts.  Sara 
 Second message from Bruce. 
 Attached are drafts for: (1)  Short cover letter to be signed by ENA (Scott Neal) requesting quotes (2)  Draft proposal for discussion purposes (3)  Draft confirmation format  Please review for accuracy and call/email to discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm still reviewing the ISDA but I asked Marie to prepare an omnibus to send Thurs. morning.  SS 
 As you may already know, Shari Stack will be handling this for ECT.  SS 
 Attached is my list of financial power deals.  Are there others? 
 Just to be on the safe side, are you familiar with this and/or should I call Rick if we have questions?  A second email to follow.  Thanks.  SS 
 the second email 
 FYI 
 Marie is not in the office today; your direct contact should be Susan Bailey (X 34737). I spoke earlier with Rick Hopkinson who indicated that the account will probably be for the benefit of EPCA. We need to verify a few details (account party, purpose, resolutions, authorized trader list, etc.).  Also, will the broker be Morgan? Nancy, since you will be working on the authorizations, please keep in mind that Ted Murphy will limit authorized traders to the Houston equity traders(and perhaps Bruce) for control purposes.  I believe we had to change the Enron Brazil Power Holding XII Ltd. resolutions in that regard.  I'll verify.  Susan and I will wait to hear from one of you in Sao Paulo.  I called about 10 minutes ago and no one was available.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Thanks for the tax article.  It's the published version of the one I sent to you in September, 99. Also, you were going to select a date at the end of January when we could teleconference to discuss Argentine issues, and, you were going to send to me the term sheet in use in Argentina.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please let me know what you think so that Nancy can forward to lawyers.  ss 
 I just wanted to touch base with you about efforts to keep good lines of communication between B.A. and Houston about trading activity in Argentina and Brazil (both financial and physical).  I participate in Randy's weekly conference calls and Brent tells me that you have now undertaken that role in B.A.  As you know, sometimes proposals and deals "slip through the cracks" and Houston is taken by surprise.  We want to remain current and proactive. Please feel free to leave me an email or voice mail when you learn of any relevant activitiy.  I , in turn, communicate directly with credit in Houston (Pat Cini or Rod Nelson) and tax in Houston (Lynn Aven or Rick Hopkinson or Michael Herman).  If you ever feel the need for a conference call, I'm always available and I'm sure credit and tax would be glad to join.  Also, I hold a weekly Friday conference call with Brent and Lynn to discuss current trading issues in Argentina and Brazil.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Should we invite one of the tax lawyers to our weekly meeting to discuss new forms and answer any tax questions?  ss 
 I don't know why you never received this message! 
 I am trying to distinguish these two types of entities both practically (what are we able to negotiate) and legally (what do we really need in our Schedule).  I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these parties.  ENA's form of "municipal" Schedule ("the ENA Schedule") was essentially taken from the 1992 ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule ("the ISDA Schedule").  In addition to other provisions, the ISDA Schedule (1) adds reps designed to avoid "an Orange County" type meltdown and (2) incorporates the concept of "Incipient Illegality" (which occurs before the Termination Event of  Illegality).  The "Incipient Illegality" concept is used  in Section 2(a)(iii) (obligations) as well as the Section 3 (reps) of the ISDA Schedule:   the concept is added to the Section 3(b) rep ("..absence of Event of Default, Potential Event of Default, Incipient Illegality...), and for purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence.  Interestingly enough, the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3(b) rep change.  I think we need to add this change to ENA's Schedule.  With respect to IOUs, we need to clarify our position on "Regulatory Development" (which is actually a watered-down "Incipient Illegality" concept).  If such an event occurs, ENA should be advised of the event (Notice).  But, does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at mid-market ("Additional Termination Event") or simply to have this event included as part of a Section 3(b) rep such that the occurrence of the event merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA's side of the curve (for breach of the Section 3(b) rep)?  I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the "Notice" provision can be difficult.  Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough.  Arguing for a Section 3(b) change may be easier (and would mirror the municipal format).  I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development (which we may only learn about through notice from the counterparty).  Thus, I recommend that for IOUs, we add a notice provision and Section 3(b) rep change incorporating our latest definition of "Regulatory Development."  But we really have to negotiate for this protection.  Otherwise, why bother to include this additional language?  What do you think? 
 I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the following comments:  (1)  I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities. However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for obvious errors.  (However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research on our behalf.  I'll discuss with him).  (2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on authority/regulatory issues.  In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than outside counsel's domicile.  (3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a "Regulatory Development" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we may also have a Termination Event under our current format). 
 Would someone please provide me with an explanation of the purpose of this account.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The financial trading group has a recurring request by our conterparties to add a provision addressing the admissability of trader tapes into evidence in court or other proceedings.  Our current language merely states:  "Each party consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any and all communications between officers or empoyees of the parties, and waives any further notice of such recording."  Here are the facts and issues:  1.  Our agreements provide for arbitration (most likely) or jurisdiction in specific courts or are silent as to jurisdiction.  2.  ENA policy is to destroy trader tapes after 6 months.  3.  If we are doing our job, a written and signed confirmation should exist in our files for each and every financial transaction.  On occasion, we have not confirmation signed by ENA's counterparty.  By agreeing to add "admissability" language, are we waiving the parol evidence rule?  Do we always want the ability to introduce existing recordings?  Can you provide us with language acceptable to ENA that we might propose to a counterparty (when asked)?  Here's an example of a recent request:  "Any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the prupose of extablishing any matters pertinent to the [ISDA] Agreement." 
 Please see attached.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I hope Bruce's explanation is sufficient!  Please call me if you have any other questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I don't know if you have spoken with Susan Flynn about her schedule before/after her surgery, but I have some questions that you may have already addressed, such as:  Has Susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation (i.e., existing masters, agreements to use ENA master/terminate counterparty master,etc.) with the various CES counterparties?  Carol mentioned that she could finalize this project.  Will someone receive be checking Susan's email and voice mail and physical mail each day?  What efforts (if any) are ongoing with respect to PGE?  What about existing files?  Top Tens (Swiss Re)?  Any ISDA comparisons could be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys.  Who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting?  Who is entering year-end deals onto Lotus Notes?  Should Susan Bailey handle per Carol's suggestion?  I'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding of how to handle the situation.  Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 Can you email a copy of the "Loan and Security Agreement" to me at sshackl@enron.com?  I can then redline suggested changes to your agreement. Thanks.  If you need to call, I'm at (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I am following up with MS but I haven't received your answer.  Will advise when I hear back.  SS 
 yes 
 Are the certificate(s) to be issued by BONY restricted or common?  (sounds like restricted and to be issued in the name of PEP)  I think that we can lodge the physical securities at MS (in the vault) for the account of Enron....Holdings XII with a stock power from PEP.  Are we headed in the same direction here?  SS 
 You'll need this draft for later use.  SS 
 Morgan Stanley has advised me this morning of the following with respect to accounts:  1.  The name of the account must be identical to the name of the certificate holder. 2.  An account holding only a certificate(s) is subject to a minimum equity requirement of USD 500,000.  As the certificate holder is the Brazilian company PEP, the broker will require additonal equity.  I am still awaiting a broker response as to whether the certificate holder can execute a stock power in favor of the account holder thereby enabling us to lodge the certificate(s) in the existing (Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII) account.   Alternatively, the certificate(s) can be held in the Enron Corp. vault.  Robert, when do you need to respond to BONY? 
 Could someone please follow up on the status of this CP.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I would like to take the following days in February as vacation days:  February 3,4,18  Please let me know if this presents a conflict.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'll need the file - 
 Gosh, I had totally forgotten!!  That Friday makes for a long President's Day weekend which I was trying to arrange.  Will this lunch be too difficult to reschedule?  Just let me know.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  Are you feeling better?  You missed our group meeting.  I asked what I thought was an innocent question about the legal survey database since it was related to part of our discussion.  BIG MISTAKE.  Tana was explosive.  Sorry you missed it. 
 McISDA is sprouting Golden Arches.  Although we have a serious legal issue, I think the CP really wants to develop a long term relationship with Enron and will overcome the problem.  Also, CP is interested in eliminating a Credit Support Annex and will call Tanya (or already has called her).  Call me and I'll give you the scoop.  Sara 
 The ADR certificate(s) can be directed to Donna Lowry for safekeeping as follows:  Enron North America Corp. EB 2407 1400 Smith Street Houston, Texas  77002  Donna is a compliance officer  for ENA and affiliates.  You can reach her at 853-1939. 
 I have been receiving the "Enron International Southern Cone" list of projects (updated weekly) for the B.A. office for quite some time.  As you know, it covers trading Projects and Claims/Litigation/Regulatory.  Is there a similar list prepared for projects originating in Brazil?  I would like to recieve such a list as would the parties copied above.  Please let me know. Regards.  Sara 
 You should contact ECT's counterparties periodically throughout the negotiation process, as warranted.  Please call NYSEG to follow up.  Also, Carol is reviewing the PSE&G comparison so please call her and you guys can review the ISDA together.  If you are uncertain as to how to keep in touch with our counterparties, please chat with me.  Thanks.  SS 
 We are currently updating our database of brokerage agreements for Ted Murphy.  We only show two (2) executed agreements for ECTRIC and/or UK SPVs. These include agreements that ECTRIC has with Fimat Futures UK Limited and Paribas Futures, Inc.  If other such agreements have been executed, would you please advise and send copies to Houston.  Ted will now keep a duplicate set of agreements. Also, would any other European locations have executed brokerage or futures agreements?  If you have any questions, please call. Regards.  Sara 
 ENA can confirm the transaction on our "omnibus confirmation" with one or two minor changes (Joe:  please call me). Also, ENA sent a draft ISDA Master Agreement to Puget Sound Energy on 3/9/99.  If you anticipate more financial trading, please let me know as we should pursue execution of the ISDA Master Agreement.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please respond. Thanks.  SS 
 Mark:  have you spoken with Brent  or the Marval firm about this?  Please call me when you have a chance.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Have you and Mark ever discussed this?  Have you spoken with Marval?  I'd really like some more information.  Thanks.  SS  P.S.  Is tomorrow a holdiay in BA? 
 FYI 
 Please call me after you have reviewed the attached Loan and Security Agreement.  Sara x3-5620 
 Can we schedule a conference call?  Sara 
 I have two (2) tickets for "Wit" playing at the Alley Theatre for Friday, Feb. 11 (8 pm, Sec. 4, Row G).  Let me know if you are interested.  No charge.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Let's enter into the database.  I'll meet with you shortly to discuss further.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a redline based upon the document generated by you.  I'm sure there will be many items for discussion and I look forward to hearing from you.   Regards.  Sara 
 Happy New Year!  I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine commercial group.  They have told me the following:  (1)  An association known as the "Argentine Association of Derivatives" has developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for use in the near term.  It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA.  It is a "short" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex).  (2)  This document is being prepared by experienced professionals.  Are you involved in this effort?  Is ISDA involved?  Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing. If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara 
 Let's verify that this is an IOU.  The Master should be sent to the attention of Dave Brown and you should advise Cary of when it was sent to the customer.  He may want a copy.  ps  Remind me to give you both copies of Tana's utility analysis.  Also, Marie, let's talk about the utility language and circulate for comment. 
 Happy New Year!  Just wondering if you had an opportunity to review the CSA and comment.  Drop me a line or call 713/853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I would like to pursue with Marval.  Should we meet to discuss?  Sara 
 Joe Hunter no longer handles financial power.  Please refer to names below. Thanks.  Sara 
 Brent:  Gabby Aguilar(?) from BA has requested Lynn for an "immediate white paper" addressing tax issues for physical (power, gas and I don't know what else) and financial trading in Argentina.  What phone call on Thursday were you referring to on your voice mail?  I'll try to call you in about an hour. Sara 
 I still need to revise the agreement for the bank/broker.  I need the exact name of the lender and an addressee. Smith Barney was sent to Steve Piasio. Thanks.  Sara 
 Here's my goof!  Give me a call.  Sara 
 The draft is ready to go but we need one (1) item from credit.  Hopefully, this should be resolved within the hour!  Do you want a copy?  SS 
 Lynn will come to my office at 9 am.  Julian will try to be here too but he has an 8am meeting and may be late.  I can call you if you like, but just let me know which number.  SS  P.S.  Shall I just schedule a call with you and Mark? 
 Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.  To my knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17 doesn't mention Mark).  So, I'm totally confused.  If we are going to discuss the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.  If you want to cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and advise Lynn and Julian).  Thanks. 
 Let me know if you have comments or want to discuss further. P.S. to Rod:  We need to talk about Basin 
 I spoke briefly with Gary Perlmutter who now represents the parent Sempra Energy but who told me that restrictions on the regulated utility have been lifted by the CA PUC.  I will verify (or I'll give you his name, etc. and you can speak with him directly) when the SDG&E lawyer returns my call.  Thus I am not sure that your online efforts require limitation.  I will also inquire about SDG&E's online objectives.  SS 
 I'm available as well.  Sara 
 Of course.  Just let me know what deadline you would like.  SS 
 I am finalizing the docs and we should coordinate with Julian.  You may want to let Scott Neal know that we will need his signature.  SS 
 That will be fine.  Sara 
 Holly Krebbs just did a deal with these guys (short form) but they want to negotiate an ISDA.  We need to send an updated form to them.  Will there be any credit changes? 
 Central Puerto has been unresponsive to Marie's requests for original documents.  Can someone please contact Marie and help us speak with the counterparty?  Thanks.  Sara 
 See attached letter 
 We will need to update this ISDA on our new, revised, fantastic format!!! I'll have to find out who to send it to.  SS 
 FYI - Brent please call.  Sounds like we ought to accelerate our plan.  SS 
 Could this be an alternative to our recording issue? 
 Thanks.  SS 
 Attached is a short letter advising subs/affiliates of ENA of existing brokerage and futures accounts.  I thought these should be sent to the general counsel and CFO/Treasurer of each company.  Please let me know your comments, frequency of review, whether any other group should monitor, etc. Each attached Exhibit will contain only a list of accounts.  I have not included account numbers but we can do so and include any other information you consider relevant.  Remember, the only other "brokerage account matrix" which we have produced is a quick view of brokerage firms and Enron companies.   Thanks. 
 In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that the definition of "Loss" picks up the concept of "Unpaid Amounts."  Arguably it does (although the concept of "Unpaid Amounts" is built into the ECT Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date). My guess is that we decided that Omnibus "Loss" pv of economic loss includes both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.  Can you recall? 
 Can we schedule a short call on Tuesday to discuss the local Argentine derivatives issue?  I am not free at 10 - 11 am or after 2:30 pm. Houston. Also, have you been able to confirm whether Don is the man in charge in Brazil?  Sara 
 Great!  I'll call you at 1pm Houston time.  SS 
 Just received this message this very minute.  The draft already went.  Sorry. 
 Who is handling the amendment? 
 Can you give me a little more info on this topic?  Is anyone in Houston involved?  I just want to make certain that we haven't missed anything in the process.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - I will be out of the office on Feb. 3 and 4.  Let me know if you want to reschedule earlier.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to the distinction between "investor owned utilities" (or "IOUs") and municipal utilities (or "municipals") in connection with derivatives activity.  In the U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.  Thus, we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance in its state public utility commission proceedings.  A copy of that Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.  Our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different.  When negotiating an ISDA Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of "Incipient Illegality" and an enforceability opinion.  A copy of that Schedule is also attached for your reference.  We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).  In that regard, would you recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format? 
 Should we be entrenched in this type of activity?  I'm not even sure that we find out about all of ESA's ideas.  Sara 
 What is the issue?  I have no idea if anyone is looking at this.  Sara 
 It sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring!  I have been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some type of "Deal Report".  In Houston and Argentina, the business groups circulate a transaction listing.  Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina circulate a listing from Legal's perspective. Is a commercial team deal report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the circulation?  I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.  It would be helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.  In that regard, what is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?  I am glad to prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.),  Let's coordinate for the seminar which you are organizing for March.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Looks like he's an expat in Singapore. 
 Definitely Thursday or Friday - just let me know so that I don't leave and lock it up! 
 Just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the "advisory memo" to be sent to the Enron subs/affiliates regarding brokerage agreements.  I have no real deadlines, only a self-imposed deadline so that we can get this thing organized and running on a regular basis.  I would appreciate your input. I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 7&4; maybe we can chat early next week. Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan should have already checked with the counterparty.  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Jeff Nogid has called about putting some ENE masters in place.  I have already spoken with Clement about this.  ENE will be trading FX, interest rate and equities through Gary's group.  Jeff mentioned names such as Merrill Lynch Cap. Services, Credit Suisse and Sumitomo.  He will obtain specific names and contacts at the various firms and forward that information to me and/or Shari.  We'll let you know.  Sara 
 Under separate cover, I will fax to you a copy of the February 6, 1998 legal opinion which, from my research, created the "issue"  between SG&E and Enron North America Corp., formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  It might be easiest if SD&G reissues the opinion without the qualification contained in Paragraph 5.  Please let me know what you think.  Regards.  Sara 
 I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty.  Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that you would normally grant?  If so, who has issued the opinion?  I look forward to your reply.  Regards.  Sara 
 I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 & 4. Carol is attending a class on Feb. 3. Please direct inquiries to lawyers present on those two days. Kaye Ellis knows how to reach me in Baton Rouge. 
 I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.  The CP is anxious to receive an ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions. Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).  Thanks.  Sara 
 James Hardie Australia Finance Pty. Limited Thanks for the response. I'll let you know what I conclude (or am able to negotiate!). Please keep me updated.  Sara 
 Absolutely! 
 Tracy Ngo will be preparing credit for an ISDA.  The draft should be sent to (Steve) Morus at the CP (check the green file because we've done an omnibus).  You can insert NY law but no other omnibus changes need to be made.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Test sent message, please reply.   Felix. 
 Sorry for the extreme delay in getting back to you.  I have not forgotten and will get to this as soon as possible.  Sara    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 reply test2.  Felix 
 Drop by.  We've been trading financial power for over a year.  Not many deals, though.    Enron North America Corp. 
 We need a new ISDA using our current form changes.  Sara 
 FYI - we may need to revise.  Does this ISDA have our new changes? 
 email address is correct but I am not Carol St. Clair (the next name in your list). 
 We need to contact these guys before our legal/credit meeting.  Let me know if you want me to make the contact.  SS 
 Have you sorted through the ENE ISDA masters with Jeff Nogid?  Should I call him again?  Anyway, it looks like another request is attached.  Sara 
 I never heard back from you last week.  Can we continue to send this report monthly?  Some addressees have changed.  Sara 
 Feb. 17 is good for me. 
 check voice mail message.  need GT&C to make this go.  ss 
 Trying to set up conference call with Tiger (will advise).  Enron Corp. lawyer out of town until tomorrow afternoon; trying to find another Corp. lawyer to review the guaranty.  Also, received e-mail from Harvard asking when I'd respond.  Is this just a routine request?  SS 
 Was the meeting this morning cancelled?  Rick Hopkinson and I waited for about fifteen minutes.   Sara 
 Does this sound familiar? 
 Hi!  I'm the ENA lawyer with whom you will be speaking with respect to this Master Agreement.  I know that Marie Heard has called you regarding your review of this document and I was hoping to facilitate that discussion. Please let me know if you have specific questions and/or if we can schedule a conference call.  You can reach me via email of (713) 853-5620.  Thanks. Sara 
 per my voice mail 
 Are we also trying to put an ISDA in place? 
 Sounds like an interesting meeting.  SS 
 I received a call from Jay Boudreaux (CTG group working with paper & pulp) about presenting "agreements" to the lender (Paribas) for review in connection with the loan for construction of the mill.  I know that Jarrod has prepared "draft confirms" for these companies but I don't know if anyone has raised the ISDA issue.  Sounds like too many hands in the pot but the bank may really need to see Master Swap Agreements.  Let me know if this has already been addressed.  Thanks.  Sara 
 (1)  I have to leave early this evening to pick up pets (about 5:45)  (2)  Just a thought after seeing Shari's email:  would the paralegals and/or lawyers benefit from the two seminars "Successful Working Relationships" (valuing differences; creating understanding)?  Should this be mandatory with some type of follow up to help improve group communication skills? 
 I am in the process of finalizing the ISDA and need for you to provide me with a definition of the "Cross Border Lease"  for insertion into Paragraph 12 of the Credit Support Annex.  I will need to refer to the lease in several places.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm always in town.  Just let me know when you're going to be downtown. Nothing new here either!  Just work, work, work.  I hope to get away for the fourth but one never knows.  SS      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I generally don't forward this kind of stuff but this seemed interesting - 
 Why not?  I offered him the opportunity to choose his "investment Bar Mitzvah gift"!!!!  (or else I make the selection in his behalf) 
 What is a cardio cath?  Was she having problems.  Zach is not a little guy. I'm going for an allergy shot.  I'm so tired that I'm getting to be boring. I wish Mother had email.  We could have 3-way discussions.  Sas 
 Ed,  Sara asked me to forward this agreement to you.  She said you can send it to ABN AMRO Bank.  Kaye 
 fyi 
 713-646-3490 
 Here's the document.  I'll bring the changes to you shortly.  Thanks.  Sara 
 As we just discussed.  SS 
 Can we get together and review the outstanding issues?  How about this afternoon or tomorrow morning?  Sara 
 Thank you, dahling, for the lovely card.  I'm thinking of you as well (but I ALWAYS think of you).  I'll be thinking of you when I am in New York and especially when I pass by Ferragamo.  And when I pass by Tiffany's.  I hope your day is filled with valentines.  Love,  Sas 
 How about 9 am tomorrow morning in my office? 
 This was the "explanation" that I forwarded to Shari for dealing with Canadian utilities, munis, etc.  I'll follow up with her when you have identified specific  Canadian counterparties or provinces which are needed for EOL.  Sara 
 Is 9 am OK? 
 Can you please advise of legal holidays in Brazil during the remainder of February and March?  I don't know how many days Mardi Gras/lent last.  I need to plan future trips to Sao Paulo.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Would you please send a calendar of legal holidays in Argentina for 2000?  At the moment, I need to plan for the remainder of February and March.  Thanks. Sara 
 Sami:  Can we schedule a short conference call to discuss?  I am in the office all week except for Friday (and Monday, February 21 is a legal holiday in the U.S.)  Please let me know your availability.  Maybe you can select from the following this week:  Tues, 2/15:  10:30 am until 1 pm, after 2 pm  Wed., 2/16:  9 am until 10 am, 11am until 2 pm, after 3 pm  Thurs., 2/17:  1 pm until 4 pm  All of the foregoing times are Houston times. Also, I am trying to verify holidays in Brazil for the remainder of the year.  Is Bracewell looking at early or late March?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Great! 
 I will have the letter executed.  I changed references in third to last paragraph to read "ECT" rather than "Enron" and replaced Bill Coffman's name wtih Robert Loughran, ext. 142.  Do you assume responsibility to transmitting to Canadian immigration or do we?  Please explain the process.  Thanks.  Sara    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 FYI:  Ed Quinn advises that he is once again in negotiations with P&G for a 5 year, 50,000T/yr SWAPTION.  When our prior negotiations with P&G were halted, we were waiting to review P&G's proposed alternative (or variation) to "non-reliance". 
 Would you please incorporate all holidays for Enron Corp., Enron Argentina and ESB (Brazil) onto my calendar?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a clean and redline version of your document with Enron North America Corp.'s suggested changes.  Please call me to discuss when you have had an opportunity to review.  Also, does your document contain "coding" information?  I was a bit confused by some of the characters appearing in your version.  Regards.  Sara  (713)  853-5620 (phone) (713)  646-3490 (fax) 
 I will be out of the office on Friday.  Monday is President's Day.  Shari or Carol may be available on Friday.  Sara 
 1.  At the end of the "Notice of Exercise" clause, ass"(but not both)"  2.  Instead of "Additional Provisions", insert the following:  Special Provisions:  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise by the Buyer of the option to enter into either Underlying Transaction I or Underlying Transaction II is conditioned upon (i) the execution by the parties on or before the Expiration Date of an ISDA Master Agreement and (ii) Enron Corp. Risk Assessment and Control approval [of what?].  In the event that either/both (?) condition is not satisfied prior to the Expiration Date, this Transaction shall terminate on such date without further action or payment required by either party. 
 Thurs:  between 12 -4 Tues:  between 11 - 2, after 3 
 Patricia:  I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection with our discussion of last week.  I can't recall if you were going to try to speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically, with respect to the template currently in circulation.  I think you were also going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association. Please advise when you have further information.  I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.  I am considering a trip to BA during the week of February 28.  Will you be in town that week? During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation. Regards.  Sara 
 I am planning a trip to BA from Feb. 27 - March 3.  The objective will be to present derivatives training for the BA traders, meet with tax and legal representatives and the Argentine Derivatives Association with respect to changing tax laws, legislation, and "local" derivatives trading, and sitting down with Mike Guerriero to establish an "action plan".  The monthly swap calendar does not indicate other lawyers out of the office during that week. Please note this on the group calendar.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  Mark - let me know if there are other issues you would like to have addressed. 
 the lawyer, of course!  SS 
 FYI - You ought to choose one of these and start putting away money on a regular basis.  You'll be rich one day!!!!  Sas 
 yes, where? 
 Patricia:  Thanks very much for your quick response.  I would very much like to solicit your help in arranging some meetings when Lynn Aven (tax) and I visit BA in two weeks.  We definitely want to meet with one or more members of the ADA who are responsible for drafting and implementing the new agreement.  And your suggestion to meet with your colleague who has been lobbying for derivatives tax legislation is one we readily accept.  Could you possible try to schedule these for convenient times on Tuesday and Wednesday, February 29 and March 1, respectively?  I will be out of the office tomorrow but in next week.  Enron is closed on Monday,  February 21 for President's Day.  Let me know if you would like to speak directly of if I can assist in any way.  Looking forward to our visit.  Sara 
 Attached is the Media News draft confirm.  Paul will call about that one. Traders will book new deal and kill prior transaction with Affiliated Newspapers.  (notice the merger and/or name change issues????) 
 I'm waitlisted on the Continental flight so we may be traveling separately. I do, however, have a room reservation at the Sheraton Towers.  Kaye can help you.  I'm out of town tomorrow so let's regoup on Tuesday.  SS 
 Lynn and I will be in BA during the week of Feb. 28 to meet with lawyers, accountants, commercial group, etc.  Just a heads up for you.  Sara 
 let's talk on Tuesday, dude 
 Congratulations!  What a great story for future generations.  Love, Sara 
 I will not be able to attend this afternoon's meeting as I have a doctor's appointment.  Also, I am looking forward to hearing details of Friday's luncheon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The ball's in my court to respond to Basin.  sara 
 am I nuts? 
 I don't think Marie handled yet.  Please handle and advise Brent that you are the person working on Argentina.  Also, we can send the latest deal report which we should discuss briefly (and the new list of addressees).  Thanks. Sara 
 Patricia:  Just checking to see if you received this message from last week and how the arrangements were proceeding.  Please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 looks fine with me 
 Credit has not received financials.  Can you help out here to get the ball rolling?  Sara 
 Please see attahed.  Let me know if you have questions about the  option template and please let me know if you think the Delano draft satisfies the conversation we just had with Leslie.  Thanks.  Sara 
 In connection with the trip to BA next week, I am having some problems scheduling meetings with other consultants and would like to know whether you have been able to schedule a meeting on Tuesday (Feb. 29) or Wednesday (March 1) with your colleagues and/or the ADA.  I would appreciate hearing from you as quickly as possible in the morning because I already have requests to meet on those two days.  I would obviously like to defer to your plans.  Please call me tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm receiving mine!!!  But I'll be in Buenos Aires next week so I'll keep my fingers crossed that my computer is working (in the event any further earth shattering Lehrer family announcements occur).  My mom does not know how to turn the computer on but she does have an email address.  We better wait until she "gets comfortable" with the concept of email before handing out her address.  At this very minute, my dad is returning from a convention in Atlantic City.  He called me from the airport on his CELL PHONE.  You see, it took me some time to get him to carry his cell phone with him.  I'VE SUCCEEDED!  Talk to you soon, Mr. Webmaster.  Sara 
 FYI 
 I think Tanya worked on this.  FYI, I'll be in Argentina next week.  SS 
 That will work just fine!  Just let me know where to meet.  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Patricia has asked who should be included in the group for Wednesday, March 1.  Do you and Andrea want to be included?  Any commercial people? 
 We do not have the answer for you at this time.  It must be researched.  Sara    Enron North America Corp. 
 Whatever you can do is most welcome.  We are only limited by time.  We have set aside the entire day of Wednesday, March 1 for you to schedule.  We can also be available late Monday afternoon, February 28.  I will advise shortly with respect to local invitees.  Thanks very much.  Sara 
 no 
 Only to make sure that we (especially Lynn Aven) can speak with your tax partner with respect to derivatives issues.  Thanks.  Sara 
 We'll do that and resend. 
 It's OK this time.  The Determination Period in this confirm is confusing; exchange-based price sources should be tied to the delivery month/Determination Period. 
 Patricia:  Thanks for putting the meetings together.  In addition to Lynn Aven and me, both Andrea Calo and Brent Hendry would like to attend.  I'm looking forward to visiting with you next week.  Regards.  Sara 
 I received a message from Augustin David to return his call to discuss the master.  The number he left rings but does not answer.  I have tried calling several times.  Maybe we can talk to him next week when I am in BA.  Sara 
 I'll let them know. It's very possible that one or both will be unable to attend due to the office activity but they both want to be available.  Thanks again.  Sara 
 Please change on my calendar 
 FYI 
 FYI - Shari Stack is negotiating the brokerage agreement with Banc One and there seems to be an issue over the interest rate.  Needless to say, I have never had any conversations with Banc One over this issue.  SS 
 Carol:  I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.  I think credit should have a "separate worksheet" and make a determination for each question you've listed.  For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.  One issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a different level.  How does credit identify the counterparty, much less determine if that counterparty is an ESP?  I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be inadequate.  And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?  A separate list would help in the evaluation.  Are we going to have another credit lunch?  Hope all is going well.  Sara 
 Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29. The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc.  Please let me or Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.  Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants. Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.  Sami has been diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of references to PPA's and SWAPS.  We are still trying to get our arms around all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.  Have you heard from Yao?  This international position may be right up his alley. Sara 
 Attached is the origination list from Brazil. SS 
 Sami:  I'm concerned about the deals showing up on the origination list which we received on Friday.  There are multiple references to swaps.  We need to talk. I'm in Argentina and may not make the call tomorrow because I have meeting outside the office.  I'll try to call you tomorrow.  sara 
 With respect to this counterparty, you may continue to agree to these IDENTICAL early termination provisions until otherwise notified by credit.  SS 
 Chuck:  I am currently in our Buenos Aires office for the week.  I have to resolve our few issues when I return to Houston.  I can tell you, however, that we cannot agree to provide you with the legal opinion as to enforceability as we discussed in our conversation last week.  I'll follow up with you next week.  Sara 
 Where do you want to go? 
 Susan:  This report should also be routed to the Argentine traders and, in Brazil, only Sami Arap (delete Robert George and Andrea Bertone).  Thanks. Sara 
 I think that the reference may be in the setoff clause and the CP was trying to exclude "other Transactions" and limit setoff to derivatives only. Unfortunately, I don't have the form with me.  SS 
 Just kidding!  I'm fine.  I've been cut off twice on telephone calls to the states so I may have problems calling you in the next hour or so when I leave the office.  FYI: NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.  It's too early for the mutual fund reports.  The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for lunch and they were much better than tamales.  I read the tamale article in the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS (whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales were really HOT).  Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.  Thursday and Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an agreement.  I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).  Love, the DG 
 Would you please add me to th distribution list for clippings.  Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 I hope you are doing well.  I finally have my laptop so I can at least read email during the day.  The weather here is gorgeous.  It's about 72 during the day and cooler at night.  We went to a restaurant that had a "tunnel of fudge" por d'creme.  Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in the Charlie Trotter cookbook.  Do you have that cookbook?  I know you have a lot of them.  I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday morning at 6:30 am.  Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.  How's mother and daddy? I can't send mother email because she may pick it up on her voice mail. Love, sas  PS  Are you working on Friday? 
 When do I get to see you?  What are you doing for the fourth?  When are you going to visit Miami?  When do you want to eat sushi?  SS 
 I have meetings this morning with the Marval firm but was hoping you could help out here. 1.  Could you please check with the Alley Theatre Box Office and find out if I have tickets for a performance this Friday night (March 3).  They will check under the name "McKeogh" and my local phone number "713 664-3207". Just let me know so that I can figure out what to do.  2.  Could you please change my McDonald's phone call presently scheduled for 1pm (BA time) tomorrow.  I would need to reschedule through Mike Irgang(info in lotus notes) at McDonald's and let Ed Quinn know.  My BA schedule is on my calendar.  3.  I am tentatively planning a trip to Sao Paulo.  I will stay from 3/17 through 3/27.  However, I need to arrive on 3/16 and depart on 3/28.  Could you please check flight availability?  I first need to clear through Mark Taylor and I will copy you on that message.  Thanks. for now. 
 Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss. There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the commercial group and the lawyers as follows:  1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization) 2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)  I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio). Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara 
 You are brilliant!  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Hi Felix!  I return from Argentina this weekend.  I am having some problems with the laptop which I'll need you to adjust upon my return. I am traveling with an ESA person from Houston who has a laptop and never experiences any of the daily problems which I have.  The problems are:  1.  Immediately upon logging in each day, I receive the following message: "This install. will install CITRIX ICA Client  - YES or NO"  2.  "Unable to load workspace file destop.dsk.  File is in use by another program.  Delete the file and create a new workspace?"  Also, the screen freezes frequently and I'm not sure what this is related to.  I can't use the laptop offline to even get into word. When can we review these problems?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rod and Susan:  I met with the counterparty and lawyer last week.  Following are the results: Rod:  CP would like a phone call to discuss the Schedule and CSA.  They mainly want explanations as to why ENA made the elections in the docs for: 1.  p.1 Cross Default Threshold 2.  p. 2 Additional Event of Default, part (xi) 3.  p. 4  issue providing Quarterly Unaudited Consolidated financials 4.  CSA p.2:  How was Collateral Threshold determined  Susan:  CP would like the following: 1.  Schedule p. 3:  sample certificates per third entry for docs to be delivered 2,   "                p. 5:  need to get address 3.   "                p. 6:  Process Agent.  Need to provide CP into on CT Corp.  You will need to speak with Julian Poole because the CP has fairly good English (the lawyer does not speak English) and Julian may want to schedule the call.  I don't know how quickly the CP will want to act because there is a Stamp Tax issue to be resolved.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Lynn:  I would like to standardize procedures for Argentina as much as possible (this week while fresh in my mind).  Attached is Julian's message to Houston.  Is this OK to put into email?  Let me know when you have time to breathe.  Also, in terms of an updated memo on Argentina issues, should I add to what you write or vice-versa?  My thought is to essentially update/modify the legal memo written in Dec., 1997 that Brent gave to us.  Let me know. Thanks.  Sara 
 Per my email, you will need Julian on the phone due to the language problem. All else is in Lotus Notes.  Sara 
 This is my favorite new game.  Also, the latest issue of "Wine Spectator" has a photo of Charlie Trotter on the cover.  SS 
 This if fine for me.  SS
