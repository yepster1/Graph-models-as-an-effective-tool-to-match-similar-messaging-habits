 with Daddy this morning but he had to cut me off as usual.  See you soon, dahling!  CALL ME when you get this message.  Sass    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Per my voice mail.  I think Suzanne already reserved a room. 
 Tanya:  the Morgan lawyer called about putting ISDA Master Agreements in place with the following Enron entities:  Enron Canada Corp. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. (trading UK nat gas) Enron Liquid Fuels Inc.   (trading propane)  She indicated that guaranties were all about to expire in June. All of Morgan's commodity business is being centralized in the above Morgan entity. Please let me know how you are going to handle this in case Beth Ng calls me back.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gosh, I guessed right!!!! 
 Mark:  I know that David Minns has been sending copies of executed agreements to Alan.  These include ISDA Master Agreements and brokerage (futures) agreements executed in the name of Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.  We need to incorporate these agreements into Lotus Notes and David Minns needs to have access to our database.  Do you want to speak with Alan or should I? Also, on a related issue, do we need to keep copies of the ECTRIC Master Agreements in Houston?  Would this be necessary in an emergency situation? Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 Susan:  You were going to verify whether the ABN AMRO futures agreement should be executed by Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. (or ENA with Shane acting pursuant to the Services Agreement).  Please let me know so that either David or I can move forward on the futures agreement.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Do you have the short information sheet/request that you threw together for Enron company requests for brokerage agreements?  This would be helpful when we meet.  I am shooting for Friday at 10 am.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Marty:  Also left you a voice mail.  Are we ready to send execution copies? Sara 
 Rod:  Is this one ready to go?  Please talk to Susan.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Left you a voice mail. Check with Stacy or Jeff.  Is Janice back? 
 Paul:  Enjoyed your talk in San Antonio.  Now for the real issues:  could you send to me the confirmation templates that you have devised for credit derivatives in the UK?  Also, are there any other materials which might be helpful in the credit derivatives area?  Shari has passed this on to me and I'm reviewing a couple of Deutsche Bank transactions executed last month. Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  I haven't heard a peep about this deal until this email.  You may want to check with someone on the weather desk.  SS 
 Marty:  I will have a response to setoff shortly.  With respect to the CSA and calculation of the "Credit Support Amount," our change should not create any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a negative number.  The only reason for "specifying otherwise" in Paragraph 13 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the Credit Support Amount will be "the higher of" the amount calculated (deemed to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will be returned).  I hope this helps.  Sara 
 yes 
 Please review and let's discuss.  SS 
 Mark:  How should we handle this?  In the past, I have provided Andrea Bertone with Elizabeth Sager's latest (and evolving) physical trading forms which Tozzini has used as a starting point.  Sara 
 I'm tied up from 1-3. 
 The meeting has been moved to 1:30 - 2:30, Thursday, April 20 in Conference Room 38C1. 
 Here's the email I just sent.  If you can't find a conference room nearby (same elevator bank), I'll opt for my office. 
 Won't you miss Alec? 
 a basis swap?  A CFD is merely a swap! 
 By the way, did you resolve Zachary's "fund" issue?  Sas ps  I'm going to call you when I get a break.  I learned that I have a ticket to the game on Sat.  Oh, joy! 
 Hi, Shane.  Here's a quick update.  As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a done deal.  Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA because she didn't have an address.  I asked her to email you for the info. I am working on ABN AMRO.  I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading activity.  Let me know if you ever have any questions.  Sara 
 We need to finalize.  Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my recollection is that he may not need the back up).  Have we requested the guaranty?  Thanks.  Sara 
 I have engaged the Modrall firm in Albuquerque to help us sort through the legal issues posed by dealing with the Southern Utes both on and off line. The lawyers are Messrs. Lynn Slade and Bill Scott.  I would like to send a Fed Ex to them on Friday, April 21 for Monday morning delivery containing the following:  1.  ISDA Master Agreement and CSA boilerplate 2.  Our municipal form of Schedule for the Southern Utes and appropriate Paragraph 13 3.  A sample Schedule prepared for a general corporate (with appropriate disclaimer language) 4.  A copy of the 1993 Commodity Definitions and the 2000 Supplement  You will have to verify the current firm name.  Check the website at www.modrall.com. Send to the attention of Bill Scott.  The address:  500 4th Street NW, Suite 1000 Albuquerque, New Mexico  87102 
 Chuck:  We are getting the package together for you.  Sara 
 Mark:  Nice to meet you too!  When Credit sends us the creditworksheet, we can generate an ISDA master to send to the counterparty.  Sara 
 FYI 
 I am ready to finalize the letter agreement.  Please verify that Jeff McMahon will sign for Enron Corp.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid. Cargill does not want to "comingle" its business.  Remember, we have already given in on "affiliate setoff".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) issue until this week!]  Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided to issue transferable L/C's.  Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this is a deal breaker. 
 Carol:  I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).  Apparently we were dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just let me know.  Sara 
 Please put on my calendar with respect to "POLAND" 
 I have an early afternoon appointment.  Sara 
 Thanks so very much.  Sara 
 Please send the current DRAFT to the User's Guide to 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions to my attention.  I understand that these can be sent to reply mail.  You can reach me by phone at 713/853-5620 if you have any problems.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton [Enron North America Corp.] 
 A message from my crazy sister! 
 Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon. He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most "help" since that sweet little bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise, I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with Ron?  Love, Sara 
 the closing checklist contains the sub-trusts for Hawaii 
 attached are swap docs for the Hawaii transaction 
 Michelle:  Could you please send me the latest form of agreement that ENA should be using with its outside consultants?  Thanks.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Sara 
 Is it possible to obtain a copy of the draft "User's Guide to 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions" today?  I would very much appreciate receipt as soon as possible.  Enron is a member of ISDA.   Thanks again.  Sara Shackleton 
 no changes since last week 
 Let's schedule a time to talk.  Sara 
 Please let Randy know that I have another meeting scheduled at that time. Thanks.  Sara 
 No, but we add different provisions to the Master Agreement  for commodity trades and currency/rate trades. 
 Believe it or not, we are almost done but PG&E's lawyer has been so busy that we were unable to schedule a call last week.  I will send her some suggested comments (tonight) and we are trying to speak this week.  There aren't any problems.  Sara 
 FYI new request.  What about our master tax agreement? 
 Do you need to pass this on to Greg? 
 Harry Arora (e-commerce group) wants to take a look at Goldman's online trading operation.  His motive is to explore/navigate the site during the next 30 days (but not trade).  I told Harry that I would need to review the agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.  Although Harry does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future. We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.  Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement "as is" for the limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of terminating the agreement when he is done.  Although ENA would have a password, access could be limited to Harry [and whomever he needs to assist?].  Please let me know your decision.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Ed:  Jason Peters is an A&K lawyer working with us for about six weeks and he's helping on these agreements.  We would like to meet with you about these lenders and update ENA's position.  Could you please send me the "comparison chart" which you prepared for these banks and ED&F Mann and Paribas, and let me know when you are available to meet?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Wednesday afternoon works fine for me.  Sara 
 Jeff:  I have not heard a word from credit.  Who did you speak with?  Please let me know and I will follow up.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Do I have to diall in for this conference call? 
 Julian, 5 pm BA time is 3 pm Houston.  Before we speak, please verify that Rod will be available at 3 pm Houston. 
 I'm not impressed.  Sara 
 I have doctors' appointments from 10:30 am - 3 pm on Friday. 
 Rod and Tanya:  Please let me know who is handling so I can pass on the news to Jeff.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up and fax it to you which I will do shortly.  Sara 
 I have to leave the office by 10:45 am.  That should be enough time.  SS 
 Does anyone have any ISDA comparisons that I can give to Jason?  Sara 
 Pls add to my calendar.  SS 
 Neither Susan has any comparisons.  Flynn eagerly volunteered amendments she's got lying around.  I'm indifferent although I wonder if Flynn is simply trying to use the system. 
 BY THE WAY, your voice mail does not work!  If your phone calls roll over to an assistant or I try to leave you a voice mail, I cannot get there!  Please call or stop by.  Sara 
 Could I arrange a very short conversation with you regarding the May 28, 1999 memo from Jorge Brito Pereira?  I would like to discuss your analysis and any further actions which the local firm may be taking on ECTRIC's behalf.  I have a paper trade with a Portuguese corporate pending receipt of an enforceability opinion acceptable to ECT.  I'm not sure if we'll get there. I'm interested in further discussions you may have had internally or externally.  Sara 
 Robert:  Susan Flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of the first part of the first sentence in the "Setoff" language.  I just wanted to explain why we are requesting this change.  In reviewing our forms during the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA Schedule and CSA.  One of these changes was the deletion of  the preamble language contained in the setoff provision.  We concluded that the phrase "Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff ...;provided, however," actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early Termination Date.  What purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the setoff provision?  Please feel free to give me a call at 713/853-5620. Thanks.  Sara 
 I used the wrong email address! 
 Per my voice mail, attached is draft letter. 
 Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about the guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format. Also, I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a "General Guarantee Agreememt" on behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) on January 28, 1998.  Which format are you interested in using?  Our cap for financial transactions with PG&E is, I believe, $10 million.  Please give me a call as I am the first point of contact for negotiating the guaranty.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Joe:  Per my voice mail, see part (iii) of the above and please revise to provide accurate description of the condition to which you agreed with MediaNews.  Just to say "ENA closes on the KPM Lasara L.P. newsprint mill" is not sufficient.  Sara 
 If you send the letter, please forward a copy to me.  SS 
 Jason:  I still cannot access your voice mail (isn't your extension 34454?) If I'm right, please have your assistant look into this. Can we put these two brokerage agreements (below) at the top of your list? 
 Sheila:  Paul Radous (Ext. 58356) in credit will be monitoring brokerage accounts from a credit perspective.  I have provided him with an overview of the "process".  When he has had an opportunity to digest the information, I think it would be helpful to meet with Paul.  In the meantime, would you please begin to copy Paul on all messages to Ted Murphy regarding the purpose of new accounts.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  What is this all about?  Are you still going to decide credit issues for the ISDA?  Sara 
 Tanya:  Yes, there is an outstanding issue.  Please read the attached and let me know when you'd like to discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Can you eat lunch at 11:45?  SS 
 Is that desk doing options (NOT SWAPTIONS!)?  Why are you asking?  There are many issues on the paper desk regarding options.  Sara 
 Abbey:  On March 29, you left me a voice mail in connection with the foregoing.  Please call me at 713/853-5620 for an update and to answer you questions.  There is not much left to do.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton 
 Mark:  Thus far, I have uncovered only one "nondocumented" electronic agreement.  The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and broker dealers.  There is no agreement for this matching service.  I am not aware of other "matching services" and whether any agreements are in place. Let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks.  Sara 
 ENA  sent execution copies of the ISDA to Kellogg Company on April 10.  By copy of this email, I ask that you touch base with Tana Jones in Houston who will verify the status of ENA's ISDA with Kellogg Company and send you copies of our documents for use in your negotiations.  Let  me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 I have a morning appointment and will be in afterwards.  Sara 
 Rod:  You may recall that we spoke about upgrading the old Master Energy Price Swap to an ISDA.  Can you please send a new credit worksheet?  If you are not handling, please let me know who to nag.  Thanks.  Sara 
 (1) In connection with Taffy's report, please note the following: Aquila Canada Corp. - follow up Christiania Bank - need to send for execution Ospraie - send revisions  (2) Also, what have you heard from Laurie about the Australian ISDA's and brokerage agreements?  We should begin incorporating into our database.  If we use your assistant, we should input data during the regular business day.  (3) I have Jason helping me on about seven different brokerage arrangements and will soon need appropriate backup to send together with execution copies.  I am keeping dummy files until these are finalized. 
 Kaye:  Would you please schedule a meeting with John Suttle to discuss Harvard.  One hour will be fine.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal back to back transaction with the "booking" Enron affiliate)  for which the "booking" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services agreement.  Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove described arrangement? 
 That's fine but I have to leave shortly before 5 tomorrow.  Sara 
 I want to have the Canadian lawyer finalize docs in a timely manner.  Please advise me of your plans.  Thanks,  Sara 
 I'm on the conference call now.  John Novak suggested that you, he and Frederico speak.  It sounds like commercial and credit need to iron this out together.  John is in his office now and the call usually takes about an hour.  Sara 
 and I also need a file for:  Goldman Sachs & Co. electronic agreement 
 Mark:  Thanks so much for your explanation earlier today.  Just one more question, please:  is arbitration or litigation the preferance under English law?  How often do you negotiate to the contrary?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hey, Julian!  Susan is working on it now.  SS 
 AFAC and Marcelo:  I hope this message finds you both well.  I would like to finalize the matrix which was prepared last year so that we can create a "baseline" for future updates.  Please feel free to date the matrix as of December, 1999, if you wish.  Please forward any recent changes to me for comment  and I will respond immediately.  Then we can move on to other things!  Thanks for your help and attention to this mattter.  Regards.  Sara 
 Thanks for the redraft!  I am looking at the agreement now.  Also, I thought you would be interested in Mark's comment.  I would like to use arbitration in lieu of jurisdiction.  Please make that change and forward to me.  I will mark up with comments.  Thanks so much for your help.  Sara 
 Please follow up with counterparty for executed doc and enter into Lotus Notes.  INSIST on commercial help now if there's a problem. 
 (1)  Please change Consolidated Papers Inc. to "medium" priority. (2)  Please follow up on James Hardie and enter into Lotus Notes. 
 Susan:  Would you please follow up with Bridgeline now as I am preparing a futures agreement for them!  We need them to get their act together. Thanks.  Sara 
 This applies to all counterparties! 
 Tanya:  There's no short answer with these people!  I think we are fine with their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the Payee).  So here's my recommendation:  (1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.  He has some kind of suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be based upon satisfaction that "nondisputed" amounts having been paid by the DP.  Will he also raise the "other agreements" issue here?  Not a clue.  (2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M FINE.  (I'm fine without part B, actually)  (3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, right off the bat.  I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A as applying to "other agreements between the parties".  But Cargill proposed part A and it DOES apply to "other agreememts between the parties."  I don't want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this again with Marty.  Thanks for your continued help.  Sara 
 Hi, Sami!  Sorry we missed the call yesterday.  I just wanted to update you on some of the financial trading issues in Brazil (and I have added you to the working group list).  I am going to finalize our "swap matrix" for Brazil.  On the physical trading side, I had asked a physical trading lawyer to call you and am wondering if Elizabeth Sager ever called or emailed. Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 That will be fine.  Sara 
 Edward:  See attached revision (and please copy me if sent).  Thanks.  SS 
 Roy:  Call me and let's coordinate.  Sara 
 Susan:  Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman. Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson to sign).  I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will give you to add.  We do not need certificates or our typical authorized trader list to send back.  However, we will have to authorize password applicants on Goldman's form.  How does EOL keep track of this?  We will have to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be more) and I think he's still ENA.  I know that we will want to receive the password very soon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please put attached in the SITA file.  The ISDA parties are ENA and SITA. Michael Khajeh-No in the London office will be negotiating this agreement with SITA on behalf of ENA. 
 Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly. Thank you for your help.  Sara 
 Susan:  for the SITA file. 
 Tana:  Please see Sami's message below.  Is there something you can send?  SS 
 Attached is a form (NOT OFFICIALLY APPROVED) for use with the omnibus.  It is different from the version which you e-mailed to me earlier.  SS 
 Barbara:  Ted Murphy asked if we would negotiate a futures agreement (for Bridgeline) with Sakura Dellsher, Inc.  You may recall that we previously handled the ADM Investor Services, Inc. futures arrangement for Bridgeline. Sara 
 Kim:  Thanks for your call.  Legal received credit for Tuscon on 5/1/00 from Ed Sacks.  Susan Flynn is preparing the ISDA agreement to send to the counterparty.  Let me know if you have any other questions. Sara  Susan:  Please let Kim know when the draft will be sent.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  I would like to have this agreement (all three parts) executed early Monday and faxed to Goldman.  Gary Hickerson can sign for Enron North America Corp. together with Ted Murphy as the second signatory.  Please prepare an addendum or annex for the Client Access Agreement with the following inserts for Paragraph 9:  INSERT 1 to Paragraph 9(g) after the word "enjoined":  "upon proof of any such breach"  INSERT 2 which will replace the second and third sentences in Paragraph 9(h) :  "Any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be resolved pursuant to the ARBITRATION provision contained in Schedule A to this Agreement."  For purposes of the password ID application, we must verify that Harry Arora is still authorized to trade for ENA (and employed by ENA).  Roy Ibasco is coordinating for Harry.  After signing, we can fax to Goldman and I have the fax info.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail. 
 clean copy of fax I left for you on Friday.  Sara 
 Ted:  Later this morning, we will be sending the Goldman electronic agreement for execution.  Harry Arora will be the only "trader" authorized to receive a password for ENA.  We will ask Harry to advise us when he is finished and can then terminate (if we wish) once Harry has reviewed the website for Enron Networks.  Thanks.  Sara 
 In connection with the "upgrading" of these old ERMS masters, I have limited information which Jeff Nogid (X34782) will verify.  Please verify spelling of names, addresses, etc.  Morgan Guaranty Trust - legal is Michael Stolfi (212-648-8231) or the trader is Henry Stuart (212-648-9057) Morgan Stanley - Jeff will get the info today  We should include a cover letter in each indicating the reason why we are submitting.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Sara 
 I will deliver a new version which you can "fix" and send to Elizabeth.  SS 
 Scott:  Thanks for the delivery.  I didn't receive anything last week.   Sara 
 Attached is a "high volume" counterparty list for two categories.  With respect to the first category, Carol is handling BPAmoco and I am speaking with Cargill.  Should we address Neumin?  And should we actively try to replace existing ECT masters with ISDA's?  Sara 
 Call me. 
 Trena:  Can you please let me know if the docs from Chase are to amend the existing Repo Agreement between ENA and Chase?  What type of transactions will you be doing with Chase?  The docs I received are from a woman named Monica Turner and she has not returned my phone call.  She did not provide an email address so I don't know how to get in touch with Chase.  Can you help? Maybe get me another name?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sami:  Attached are the most recent ENA power trading agreements.  Parts of the agreements may be useful to you and/or Jose Emilio (or whomever you are working with).  Tozzini began with the earlier ENA template.  Please forward any translated trading docs to my attention.  Thanks.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Sara 
 Jeff:  Are there any  issues that I might address that would be particularly useful or timely for your group?  Sara 
 Bob:  Are there any issues that might be useful for your goup that I should address?  Also, I would like to chat with you about settlements on multiple trades.  An interesting issue was raised in our credit lunch last week. Please let me know when you are available.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Per my voice mail, can you make headway with these two companies? We have not heard back from either.  I think that there needs to be a commercial push.  Please call if you have any questions or if I can help further.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tana:  When will the database be ready for companywide access?  Sara 
 Tana:  I added several brokerage agreements to the database yesterday and all ended up in the "Other Agreements" section.  Except for one, which is an "electronic trading agreement".  Can I call our developer?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hi, Andrea!  Attached are updated power trading forms currently in use by ENA.  I thought these may be useful.  I have forwarded these already to Sami.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance or if you have a recent English translation of a current deal.  Regards.  Sara 
 Anita:  It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots going on! I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore vs. what is confirmed in London).  Is there a written set of procedures that I can see?  Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons? anyone else? Please send me an e-mail.  These issues are arising because of my involvement in working with the Brazilian office.  Thanks.  Looking forward to speaking to you soon.  Sara 
 It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these are below.  You can handle the rest, I think.  Also, he jumped on the L/C removal language that we discussed.  [references are to numbered paragraphs below] (2)  OK (5)  Did you ever receive a response from Rhett? (7)  Per already responded to you.  Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel. (11)  These are two separate issues.  Short of a conversation, it sounds like he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages. The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination based upon failure to pay. (12)  Need to be consistent for both parties. (14)  Is he right? (15)  Verify with Rod. (17)  I think I reviewed this point already, didn't I? (19)  Check with Rod and I'll also review. 
 Susan:  I have given this to Jason.  SS 
 David:  I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with any questions you may have with respect to the following items:  (1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the agreement and Susan is out until May 22. (2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I could view).  There is no problem with the deal. (3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO (Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate jurisdiction. (4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries?  I'll speak with you later.  Regards.  Sara 
 Jarrod:  Attached is a "form" letter for you to send (with adjustments as indicated) or let me know and I will sign and send with the Vitol confirms. Separately, I have faxed to you the first page changes.  Call if you have questions.  Please be sure that we have included the additional reps.  Sara 
 I would only add the ongoing cash collateral issue in Canada (and run spell check). 
 We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated ISDA definitions.  I think we should work toward replacing this master with an ISDA to eliminate the problem.  We did the same with Aquila which solved the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner than Vitol).  Can someone generate credit?  Thanks.  Sara 
 All:  I received a request from PPM to send our form of ISDA to document trading.  We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.  The only difference is that they now want to trade and the Scottish Power acquisition is done.  The contact is:  Gary Ordway 830 N.E. Holladay Suite 200 Portland, Oregon  97232 
 You are right!  Sorry about that. 
 It's true!  I am not really a lost friend, but a friend with a lost head!  I may not have time to call you today, but then again I might.  But I will call before the weekend.  Sara 
 Marie is fine with either Friday June 2 or 9.  So let's pick June 2 unless someone has a conflict.  For quick planning (invitations, caterer, limo, etc.), who wants to help?  Sara 
 Carol St. Clair has the VEPCO proposed guaranty in hand and will contact you soon.  Thanks for reminding me.  Sara 
 Sheila:  We are still working with our developer to open up access to Gary's group (read-only).  Should I include all of the names on your February 2000 org chart?  Delete some?  Add some?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Would you please handle.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).  The full set of signature documents comprises four pieces: (1)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border) (2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you] (3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains 12 paragraphs] (4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]  When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete package with all four parts.  The two emails which you previously received probably have the word "DRAFT" plastered all over them and we would normally remove this wording.  Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to dot the "i's"  and cross the "t's".  Thanks.  Sara 
 I just learned that I have a conflict on June 2.  So I have already consulted with Marie who has agreed to Friday, June 9.  I hope this works for the majority of the group.  Thanks.  Sara 
 At end of first paragraph, add:  Terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have such meaning as set forth in the Agreement.  Insert in "Credit or Other Special Provisions":  On or before 5:00 p.m. (Houston time) on Wednesday, May 17, 2000, Counterparty shall deliver to ENA Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000  which amount shall be maintained in favor of ENA in accordance with the terms of Annex A to the Agreement and which may be aggregated together with other amounts required for other Transactions subject to the Agreement in order to establish a single Letter of Credit.  Further, at any time during the term of this Transaction, upon the request of ENA in its sole discretion, Counterparty shall deliver additional Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000, subject to the provisions of the foregoing sentence.  In addition to such Performance Assurance, Counterparty shall establish, maintain, renew, substitute and increase such Performance Assurance in accordance with the terms and provisions of Annex A to the Agreement and the failure to do so shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 5A(6) of the Agreement.

 Jarrod:  Attached is the price correction language.  There is a 60 day true up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.  Upon notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.  This language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be identical.  We will need to add "Calculation Agent" to the confirmation. Please call if you have any questions.  Sara  P.S.  you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is for a cross-border transaction 
 Tana:  I've already spoken with Clem this morning and he is on board with this form.  The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em (marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599. Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Monica:  Since our recent conversation, I thought that you were going to send me the entire format for the European format for the repos.  Also, have you had an opportunity to review the existing repo between Chase and Enron North America Corp. (formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) dated as of January 29, 1998?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 Will send the MARKUP of the Axel Johnson Inc. guaranty later today.  I have inserted several provisions.  SS     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Mark:  I've been asked whether ENA can enter into derivatives with an Indian company.  Do you have research regarding legality/enforceability since the 1997 global review which ENA conducted through Allen & Overy?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Laurel:  Can you send the deal ticket for this transaction?  Sara 
 Rob:  Have you ever directly engaged counsel in New Guinea?  I have searched our jurisdictional database but to no avail.  I only find Australian firms with New Guinea associations.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Just received this on Brazil (financial) 
 Frank:  Have you ever hired New Guinea counsel? I need to engage a firm to answer derivatives issues. Thanks.  Sara 
 Rick:  Both Greg and John are traveling.  I did receive a voice mail from John advising that the deal has been delayed.  I don't have details.  John will try to call you.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hope you had a great vacation!  Please let me know when you have some time so that we can talk about Brazil.  I'm trying to update the info that Yao left me and I am now being called by Gary Hickerson's group for a progress report.  Sara

 As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley situation:  (1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. This is the entity for commodity trading. (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97  (2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions  (3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need this one?  Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.  Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in legal (Cap Services) will let me know.  I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rod:  I will contact Frederick Broda (VP, Derivatives and Fixed Income) in NY about this master.  Jeff Nogid requested this master as well.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please put on my calendar 
 Rod:  Jeff Nogid has also requested an ISDA Master Agreement with the foregoing party for equity and fixed income deals.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark and Paul:  ENA has just finalized an ISDA Master Agreement with Statoil.  I had advised you several months ago that Statoil also wanted to negotiate with ECTRIC, using the ENA agreement as a model.  Chuck O'Brien is the inhouse counsel and can be reached via email or phone (203/978-6988). Please contact Chuck and let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.  Regards.  Sara  Chuck:  Mark and Paul can be reached in London at 011-44-20-7783-6552 (Mark) and 011-44-20-7783-6566 (Paul). 
 Jarrod:  attached are comments to the confirm.  Please note that you must reference the KPM transaction in the Additional Provisions section, part (iv).  Sara 
 Michael and Deepak:  Attached are the execution copies of the documents signed with ENA.  If I have missed anything, please contact Susan Flynn (as Marie Heard is now with EBS).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hello there!  I know that you are out of the country.  Thanks for forwarding the message from Andre Cangucu.  I have been through your materials but do not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g., "Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil", "Trading with Brazilian Counterparties", etc.).  Am I missing something?  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Sara 
 Rod:  attached is a recap of current credit derivatives trading in Jeff K.'s group.  I don't know about activity during Shari's oversight but I hear it was minimal.  How does this compare with Enron Credit.com?  Also, do we want agreements with other trading counterparties (e.g., DLJ Capital Funding, Inc.)?  Are Jeff and Paul calling credit before trading?  Please call to chat when you have a chance.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Shari:  I see that you added this to the legal/credit list.  Can you tell me why?  What type of deal do we do?  Did ECTI ever transact with DLJ Capital Funding, Inc. (for distressed loans)?  Are you familiar with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, Inc. "standard terms and conditions"? Did you ever document a loan derivative?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please add to the list of masters to be drafted.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  Barbara Gray and Shonnie Daniel worked on a Q1 deal between Enron and Texaco to create a JV called BL.  I believe that the ownership is 60/40, respectively.  BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.  The swap group has already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, authorized trader lists, etc.  Before the closing, there was an "understanding" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 2000).  However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person run through an entire budget).  Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 20 ISDA's).  By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we have no one to negotiate with!  BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.  Are you interested in pursuing this request?  Sara 
 Carol:  Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates who we interviewed might have a good background for "back office" duties.  I have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience in the confirmation area).  What do you think?  Sara 
 Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea.  Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?  Sara 
 Kelly:  ENA is opening a margin line with Bank One to facilitate NYMEX trading through the Bank One broker.  Has Enron Corp. ever signed a standard Master Note with Bank One?  I'd like to see what's been previously negotiated.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please remove Mark Taylor from the distribution list and insert my name and email address.  Thank you. 
 I have two questions:  (1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, won't Greg Johnston need a "short course" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.  (2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch. 
 Sara left you a voice mail about this attachment. 
 Anne:  Thanks for your voice mail.  We would like to generate the master. I'll try to have it emailed on Monday.  Regards.  Sara 
 Maryann:  I left you a voice mail the other day regarding two typos in the agreement and never received corrected pages.  The Guarantee has been executed.  However, the agreement is awaiting the initials of Rod Nelson (credit) who is on vacation until Wednesday.  Will you send corrected pages for insertion in the document? 
 Frank:  Have you had any luck?  Sara 
 Susan:  I am told that the name of the Enron company is "Enron Investments PLC" and Lance Schuler set it up for the acquisition.  Please check on corporate database.  I'll try to get you a contact.  SS 
 Susan:  We are going to open a futures account with Bank One.  They have also sent a give up agreement.  This message is FYI. 
 Jason:  Please review (I have others for you to see).  Also, Paul and I spoke with Cadwalader this morning.  Please continue to check the international exchanges online to see if you can locate clearinhouse rules for each exchange.  Perhaps you can also find information on the regulatory scheme for the jurisdictions.  I suspect we will have to hire outside counsel in each country to answer our concerns.  Let's talk.  SS 
 All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required: (1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership (2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation  Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Sure, later today?    Carol St Clair 05/22/2000 10:43 AM 
 Mark and Paul:  Have either of you ever reviewed clearinghouse rules with respect to clearing members for the exhanges on which we trade (in an effort to analyze our risk with respect to our brokers)?  If the answer is yes, could I have copies of any memoranda?  Please let me hear from you or whomever may have reviewed this issue.  Thank you.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail, please contact me regarding swaps and other derivative activity in Brazil.   I am replacing Yao Apasu as the Houston based trading lawyer.

 Donna:  It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies of existing brokerage accounts.  It has also been determined (in legal) that the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A.  I have some temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here for another few weeks.  I was hoping that we could all meet and put our "project" into action.  Please give me a call and suggest some time when we may meet.  Thanks.  Sara

Rod, there will be  cross default  and transferability issues (check Lotus Notes) but we can discuss when CP returns comments.  Our Portland trader is Kim Ward and she would like to be copied on the redraft.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Yet another name to deal with!  It appears that Paul opened my original memo a day late.  Sara 
 Carol:  Haven't you been speaking with the confirm desk about identifying high volume transactions with "masterless" counterparties?  I don't want to duplicate work efforts.  Maybe you and I can chat during the time originally set aside for Richard (this morning).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hello!  Please send me your fax number.  I have a list of "Final and Proposed Regulations" which needs to be updated.  I would like to fax you the list. Thanks.  Sara 
 Shari:  When you get back after vacation and have caught up, give me a call to chat about the NYISO pricing.  Elizabeth suggested that we coordinate our efforts to capture extreme pricing revisions and negative pricing issues. Our power confirms currently include a modified version of Section 7.3 (of the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions) in our omnibus confirms for price changes.  I am still tracking third party paper.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please prepare the ISDA as requested.  Sara 
 What were the dollar amounts on the printout that you sent to me?    David P Dupre 05/24/2000 06:06 PM 
 Hey, Rod:  Clint has trashed Lehman Bros. (for the moment) and is doing the deal with MLI.  So, today we confirm the trade on a Deemed ISDA and have agreed to sign an ISDA within 20 days.  Would you please prepare a credit worksheet and send it down so that we can get started? Please note that we agreed to use Enron Corp. as the swap counterparty.  Also, you left the chart for the PATS-2000 deal in my office (you, bum!).  I do ask that you let me review this with you so that you can evaluate the credit risk.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Here's a heads up.  I haven't read the messge and don't know the timing.  I 'll sort throught it later today.  ss 
 Mark:  Please verify for me that you told Susan F. that Samantha would be responsible for the brokerage accounts when she joins us.  I wasn't certain that Susan knew and I didn't want to spring it on her.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.  Please note that UBS is aware of the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was attached to the original fax).  The confirms are pretty straightforward.  (1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant? (2)  The Schedule is missing some "standard" Enron type provisions (which were in the Swiss Bank master).  These include: limitation of liability confidentiality setoff isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?  this could impact our approach. (3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).  Enron's preference is arbitration. With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).  In the Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere. (4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?  If the Trust intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms. What eventually happens to the Trust?  Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS. Call if you need anything else.  Sara 
 I spoke with Kevin Zemp this morning and he will e-mail docs to me for review.  I'll keep you posted.  Sara 
 Susan:  would you please contact this party to see if they have comments? Jennifer says they are ready to sign.  We are having a guaranty problem and that's why this party has come up.  Please let Souad know what the response is.  Thanks.  Sara

 Rod:  Forgive my redundancy, but did I already request (and did you send) a credit worksheet for this counterparty?  This is another Clint Freeland/Jeff Nogid push for Fastow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  "Without Master Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA Master Agreements.  I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll leave that to your discretion).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's list! 
 Attached is a new letter for the July 17 payment which ECT owes Sonoco. Please review for accuracy.  If it's OK, one of us can fax (with the settlement statement) on the payment date.  Thanks.  Sara

 Carol:  I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to Marie.  In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina Tice, the CP credit manager.  Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on top of Brant.  Your name is on this one.  Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.  Although Richard inquired about Palladium.  I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week (according to Tanya).  Sara 
 Rod:  And what lawyer is handling this in your presence?  This is beginning to sound like Koch and all of the Koch separate trading entities!!!!  My brain is full now. 
 I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through one of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see attached message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our weather trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone (713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

 Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?  Sara
