 Hey Sam, that has to be one of the "cheeriest" cards I've ever received. Please thank Leica for her birthday wishes (and how is the old girl doing?). Do you remember my 39th at Andrea's with Pat and Dee (I think) and Ron and his wife (I've forgotten her name but I remember what she looks like)?  I remember your 40th with Beverly and Helen and the walker (you probably remember the stripper).  I need your MAILING address so that Phoebe, Chloe and I can send you a holiday card.  Are you a bi-city resident?  Do you still own Corky's?  Do you have a different venture(s)?  How is Mr. Casey?  How are Helen and Beverly?  Do you see them often?  Do you love Atlanta?  You know that at my age (it's actually been any my ages) I write in stream of consciousness.  I hope this makes sense.  Sara  P.S.  Ain't life grand? 
 Susan:  I just spoke with CSFB and entered contact info into Lotus Notes. Can I re-review the draft Schedule please?  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com

 Mark:  Attached is my current workload report.  I'm beginning to get nervous about meeting traders' expectations as I am taking vacation from June 14 - 22 (seven business days) and I don't know who will be able to pick up my emergencies and routine issues.  I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression that Brent is constantly busy with weather.  I'd like to briefly discuss Cheryl's workload  I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is "project" oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.  FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage agreements only.  The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to "cleanup" the agreement status.  It should be winding down.  I have encouraged Cheryl (as have Frank and Mary) to provide you  with a workload report since we really want her to be trained in the swap basics.  Also, I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell, you and me before I leave (topic is online trading of credit derivatives). Currently, only ECL is offering the bankruptcy default swap online (and no one is hitting the product).

 Mark/Rod:  I'll draft the annex without offering up the ENE guaranty (although you may have to speak with them since ENA offered up a guaranty for its repo). Please let me know how you want to handle defaults.  Can we resolve tomorrow (Wenesday)?  Am I being too pushy?  Thanks.

 SUPER CONGRATULATIONS!  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I am currently reviewing.  Jeff H. will respond re: necessity for Fallback. SS 
 this is the latest paper deemed ISDA.  Please mark for content against OUR deemed ISDA.  Thanks.  SS 
 I've been thinking about your query and in the interim, I find that David is very conscientious and does not let outstanding issues linger. He also seems quite eager to learn.   As I continue to work with him, I am glad to keep you updated if you remind me periodically.  Sara 
 I am still waiting for my Brazilian visa (another single entry, unfortunately).  It should arrive next week.  I was hoping to spend the week of Sept. 5-11 in Sao Paolo but that is impossible to plan without the visa. Maybe the latter part of that week or the next week will work.  If I arrive on a Sat. or Sun., what do you think about the two of us meeting over the weekend to work out a plan?  I can then devote all of my time to dealing with Tozzini on the physical and financial issues and working with originators to explain financial trading procedures.  I will need to determine if Jose Emilio (on the physical issues) and Antonio Felix and Renato (on the financial issues) will be available to meet during my trip.  I have sent them e-mails to at least pose the question.  I know that you are very busy.  Please let me know what you think about my proposal.  Also, I apologize for asking you to give up any of your weekend time.  Maybe you have another suggestion that will work better for you.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 You are fantastic!  It looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to BA around 9/12 with a longer stopover in Sao Paulo several days later which could last until 9/25 or the end of September.  Will I have the visa before then?  SS 
 No, we insist that the trader make credit aware of new counterparties or unusual trades or opportunities prior to transacting.  Credit reviews trades each morning and they know what's going on.  ss    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please let me know if you never received.  I had this hand delivered to you on Friday.  ss 
 I just received a message from Anna Chung (?) at Merrill re: the ENE master. Her number is 212-449-7494.  I also left vm for Jeff to send down deemed ISDA's or other confirms.  SS 
 Susan:  The docs are in my "in box".  I haven't reviewed and need to speak with Sheila (or have you already contacted her?).  I don't know the timing for this transaction.  How long will it take to open the account?  Feel free to grab the docs.  SS 
 Susan:  Based on Tanya's message, we should pursue the Morgan Cap Services agreement.  Let's talk when you have a chance. I've put this on our legal.credit list.  SS 
 Mark:  In connection with Susan F.'s departure, could you please provide a copy of her "project list" so that we can follow up on finalizing/redistributing her workload?  I have lots of questions which I'm sure can't be answered this minute, such as:  Shouldn't we help to prioritize her work?  Will she continue day-to-day work?  Who will take confirm desk calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be involved now), etc.  Please let us know when you'd like to "regroup".  Thanks.  Sara 
 Here's the email!  And thanks for your help this morning.  Sara 
 please print the xcel document.  SS 
 Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming along.  When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA? Please let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you in any way.  I understand that our respective traders are discussing a transaction.  You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be on vacation from October 6- 13.  Also, the ENA lawyers will be offsite October 5 and 6. Should you need assistance during my absence, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis at Ext. 35968 who will direct you to a lawyer. Thanks.  Sara 
 All:  I will be on vacation until October 16, 2000.  Because I am handling a large number of brokerage agreements and electronic trading platforms (for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.), I have asked Jason Peters with Andrews and Kurth (713-220-4124) to assist me.  Some of the agreements are for John Greene who is currently in London and those agreements may reference English law and the Financial Services Acts.  I have given Jason your names IN CASE he has any questions.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Muni's and other public entities (state, local and federal) are the type of counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc.  If we cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable (i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).  We definitely need to review certified copies of  the counterparty's charter, enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of which we always provide to the counterparty).    It's best to execute the ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.  Call if you need further help.  Sara     Enron North America Corp. 
 I spoke with Marsha Greenblatt (Sempra's trading lawyer).  She was unaware of any issues with Sempra's dealing with ECTRIC but recognized that (i) this is a credit decision and (ii) trading with ECTRIC has occurred.  Sempra does have a London trading operation so maybe the London traders for both of our respective companies have been transacting.  Of course, all confirms she reviewed were with ECT/Sempra (except for one or two ECTRIC confirms).  Based upon our recent ECT/ECTRIC internal conversation, I don't anticipate further confusion.  Thanks for everyone's attention to this matter.  Sara 
 I thought we sent it but I'll have Marie Heard email a copy right away.  SS 
 Thanks for remembering me (even though I FORGOT to send you birthday wishes last month).  It doesn't seem like a year, does it?  Hope you're doing great and your family is well.  How's the HOUSE OF THE CENTURY coming along?  I recall looking at the plans just "yesterday".  Stay well (and young).  Sara 
 Attached is the latest "redraft" of guidelines based upon my conversation with Brent (who has not yet seen the attachment).  Let's discuss these tomorrow.  I'll conference you at 9 am.  Thanks.  Sara  Lynn:  I'll forward separately Brent's proposed paragraph for the Houston trader. 
 Here's Brent's other paragraph. 
 Per our conversation.  Sara 
 Yes, I'll get to it today.  I've already spoken with Jared.  SS 
 Please!  Sara 
 Hi Christian!  I wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of negative pricing on the west desk.  I'm getting a differenct response on the east desk.  Although my interest is financial trading, you may have experieced this issue on the physical side (Jeff Hodge has not).  In the past on the west desk financial trading, any prices which are negative are deemed to be "0" (so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes).  The east desk wants to add in the negative numbers.  Please call me to discuss. I'd really appreciate it.  Sara 
 Can you recall if the trades (west desk) were swaps or puts?  SS  ps  I'm still trying to resolve 
 ADDENDUM:  I received a phone call from the Sempra lawyer this afternoon. She said that Sempra has no problems trading with ECTRIC. 
 no 
 Marie:  Wisconsin's lawyer is out of the office until Nov. 29.  Would you please follow up with respect to the ISDA which we sent to him on Nov. 5?  I left your name and phone number on his voice mail.  Cary is interested in pursuing this counterparty.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Can we conference on Tuesday, November 23?  Anytime after 10:30 am CST works.  Or anytime on Wednesday, November 24 before 3pm CST.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - I called in for the meeting this morning but no one else ever connected.  Sorry.  I have nothing new to report.  I'll be in S.P.  next week for a few days.  I'll try to get on your calendar.  Thanks.  Sara  P. S.  Happy Thanksgiving! 
 Please explain or handle.  thanks.  SS 
 consider it cancelled.  ss 
 Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent "short list" of possible products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future. The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week. My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara 
 The Tozzini lawyers will meet with us to discuss prior memoranda and products for trading.  For those in Houston who wish to be conferenced in, please contact my assistant Kaye Ellis in Houston (X35968) who will make arrangements.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please follow up on NY Elec & Gas because they'll never call back.  SS 
 Carol:  Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus Notes entry).  Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.  Tanya knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is unacceptable so CP has a MAC).  We expect their outside counsel to have some comments which we haven't yet seen.  Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand delay).  Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).  Marie has the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.  Our discussion today was general.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail!  Debra please follow up.  Call Marie if you have any questions.  Sara 
 I'll be back in the office on Friday, Dec. 3.  Kaye Ellis can reach me in the Sao Paulo office.  thanks.  SS 
 Chris and Tracy:  I will be in the Sao Paulo office most of this week.  You can reach me there (check with my assistant Kaye Ellis) or you can call Marie (X33907) and she will make certain that a lawyer is available to help you. Thanks.  Sara  Marie:  Please assist Chris and Tracy as required.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye:  did you handle?   Thanks.  Sara 
 I'll be in Sao Paulo this week.  You still didn't send me a mailing address. SS 
 Attached is my feedback.  Sara     Cullen Duke @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/19/99 02:48 PM 
 Thanks for the help.  Could you please call Chris?  Sara 
 I think that Carol may have looked at this several months ago.  Isn't this related to the request of Jean Mhra?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please revise now.  Thanks. SS 
 Prior trades already confirmed last week.  Sorry. 
 Is this the deal we lost? Please tell me what you know.  ss  p.s.  Welcome back. 
 The disappearance of a price index is a "Market Disruption Event" discussed in Section 7 of Annex A to the confirmation.  Unless an "Alternative Floating Price Source" is described in the confirmation, the Floating Price on the first available Trading Day (without a disruption) is utilized if the disruption does not exceed three Business Days; otherwise, the price is "determined in good faith by Company, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."  At the moment, your confirm does not identify alternative pricing. 
 There are a few credit issues here.  I have a 9:30 am call with Cargill.  SS 
 I just sent a fax to Chip Rainey.  No attachments.  Thanks.  SS 
 FYI 
 El Paso is a "high volume" CP with an existing ECT Master.  Marie, there is a 9/1/99 note in Lotus Notes that the CP to email its form of Schedule. What have we received?  Shouldn't we be pushing this ISDA?  Can someone prepare credit? 
 This is a "high volume" counterparty.  Shouldn't we be pursuing an ISDA to replace the existing ECT Master?  Susan, your last entry was 3/9/99.  SS 
 This is a "high volume" trading counterparty.  Shouldn't we negotiate an ISDA to replace the existing master?  SS 
 Jeff:  I thought we should update the situation particularly in light of the problems that Willie runs up against.  Can you give me a call and let's discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Did you understand my message?  Please give me a call.  S 
 The east and west power desks are creating slightly different floating price language for some of the power pools.  The west desk wants "negative prices" to be averaged in as "zeroes"; the east desk wants to average in all prices "positive or negative".  I'm inclined to let the traders do as they wish.  I can't seem to get an explanation for the difference in approach (in each instance ENA may take either side of the deal).  The confirm desk will have to pay attention to the source of the confirms to use the correct pricing language.  I don't know if this will create an on-line trading issue.  What do you think?  Sara 
 Are we still on for a lunch at the Big G tomorrow?  I'm flying to NO in the morning.  Your voice mail didn't pick up on your phone this morning (504/898-1909).  Please call and I'll even try you again.  Sara  713-853-5620 
 attached is the form.  no premium.  Also, we need to use that introductory paragraph about "mutual promises, etc," 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow.  Please have the call if you think it necessary.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm checking into to provide help.  SS 
 Per my voice mail.  Also, for YOUR use, I am attaching a "form" of gas tolling agreement.  Brent also has a "confirmation" related to a master.  Let me know if you've already handled.  Thanks.  SS 
 Per David's request, I'm attaching a (very old) form from Houston, not often used here anymore.  I'm not sending this directly to David (if only to avoid "form shopping"). Let me know if I can be of further assistance.  Thanks. Sara 
 I just spoke with Lawyer Burlingame and we're on for lunch.  My flight arrives at 10:45 and I'll drop off my bag and head for Galatoire's.   Look forward to seeing you.  ss  P.S.  My dad would like to treat us to lunch using "his waiter" who I think is named Michael. 
 In my absence on Friday, Dec. 10, please contact Susan Flynn (X30975) with any questions.  Sara 
 It seems that Miriam Radach has been transferred to Sherman & Sterling's Washington D.C. office.  She is working with a NY associate named Jennifer Kumble.  The lawyers had a lot of issues to discuss with Tiger and should give us comments next week.  Have a nice holiday!  I'm going to Baton Rouge to watch the tigers (LSU!) play ball.  Sara 
 This is FYI only since I'll be out tomorrow.  I have never spoken with Bruce.  Nothing will happen tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Bruce:  I'm out of the office tomorrow but will be back Monday.  Let's talk then please.  Sara 
 Doug:  Per our conversation, will you please forward to me and Sami a copy of the recent tolling agreement?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark and I met with Mark Haedicke regarding utilities and the need for a legal opinion from the utility counterparty.  We have agreed with Mark as follows:  1.  Our negotiations with investor owned utilities should be based upon our standard ISDA Schedule (ISDA Multicurrency Agreement) AND including the "Additional Termination Event".  Neither party should be required to provide a legal opinion.  2.  Investor owned utilites will be approved for online trading from a legal viewpoint.  The extra "Additional Termination Event" paragraph is not currently included in the GTC's but COULD be incorporated if there is a revision to the online agreement.  3.  Our position with respect to municipals/municipal owned utilities, federal/state/local owned utilities and cooperatives remains unchanged.  We should still utilize and update the "municipal ISDA" form, and, require a legal opinion from the counterparty.  In that regard, Susan Flynn has been working on an "omnibus" format for an electric co-op (Deseret Generation and Transmission Co-operative), an earlier version of which could be used as a template for a municipal omnibus confirmation. 
 FYI - just in case.  SS 
 I have no changes from last week.  Sara 
 Call me anytime today.  713/853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Good to hear from you!!!  I'm looking forward to hearing about your stay in Brazil.  Are you back in Houston?  Let's have lunch.   Sorry about the guide.  It sounds like a larger, well established hotel will have the edge on tourism information.    Michael Herman @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
 ENA booked a July-August, 2000 deal with this counterparty.  Is this company a municipal?  Have you agreed to governing law and arbitration?  SS 
 I think it's the first doc.  Check the "Re" for the deal number.  Thanks. Sara 
 I spoke with John Nassos.  He said that the company just hired a treasury/credit person last week (and that was the holdup on negotiating the ISDA).  Mr. Nassos has my phone number and all I can do is wait to hear from him or his outside counsel.  Sara 
 Let's catch up when you're ready.  1.  Received NEW draft from Pacific Gas & Electric.  Need to do ISDA comparison. 2.  Susan is out JUNE 1 and "Columbus Dispatch" needs to be finalized.  We sent blackline Friday afternoon.  Details will happen Tuesday morning. 3.  Let's talk. 
 Per my voice mail, you can see the floating price index language (power and gas) that I need.  Please email or fax so that I can insert it into my draft confirm.  Thanks.  Sara 
 please print these for me.  thanks.  ss 
 Danny:  I did not recieve new documents last night.  When can I expect something?  Sara 
 I wanted to sent you a holiday card but, alas, the mysterious Sam has no address.  I guess I could send it to your lessee in the Big Easy (remember, the doctor living in the marina) but he may not appreciate the beauty of the card.  Please email your address.  Hope you had a "Happy Chanukah".  I was in BR to celebrate with my family - Jennifer is 15 and Zachary will be 13 on January 1.  My parents are slowing down but Deb and Steve are not.  Deb ordered some brisket and latkes from the 2nd Ave. deli in NY and the food was awful.  Sara 
 I haven't heard anything further about this deal.  Attached is a framework for future revision.  SS 
 yes 
 Attached is a draft of a swaption based upon the term sheet reviewed the other day.  Elizabeth has not reviewed yet and I still have some lingering questions.  ss 
 This is scheduled to close on Friday (don't know what time).  It's Gareth's deal.  Enron Corp. is swap CP with a trust.  Don't know who is signing for Enron Corp.  Please C me to discuss and raise logistical issues.  Thanx.  SS 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 Are you OK with this deal?  I may have a few questions.  SS 
 I don't know who's working on this deal, so I'm forwarding docs to you all. Tax reps look ok to me.  [see Total Return Swap Confirmation - Sec. 3.2; Schedule - Part 5(l) and requirement that swap counterparty which is Enron Corp. deliver IRS 'Forms 1001 or 4224].  Please leave me voice mail or email.  Thanks.  Sara  ps.  this closes Friday morning 
 Please confirm the Enron Corp. account for the swap:  Citibank ABA #021000089 A/C = 0076486 
 I think that this transaction is called "Project Moosehead".  I have a meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS 
 RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise today to send in the morning.  CP is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.". Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal.  Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes on.  SS 
 Let's cancel.  OK? 
 I'll send you a brief comparison of the ERMS/Merrill ISDA from 1992 with ENA's typical ISDA used in 1999 by the morning.  Am currently working to produce the confirm format.  SS 
 Looks fine to me.  SS 
 Please make sure that I am on the distribution list for ALL documentation.  I only have the swap confirm/schedule.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a brief comparison of differences. 
 This is the doc for revision.  We need it asap.  Thanks.  SS 
 Please verify fax number for Enron Corp., VP Finance and Treasury (for the purpose of receiving notices of default)  713-646-4016 
 Please put on my calendar.  SS 
 Please print asap.  Thanks.  ss 
 no, not yet 
 2,3 and 4 
 Mike means "Mark Taylor".  Would you please let me know if Mark wants me to finalize.  Thanks.  ss 
 The Schedule calls for the exchange of Tax Certificates, being IRS Form 1001 (your latest revision). 
 The ISDA Schedule calls for the delivery of IRS Form 1001. 
 I will not be able to make the call tomorrow.  Sara 
 FYI 
 This is the deal that Susan F.  worked on on Friday.  I'll forward the Schedule to you.  No one is asking for a revised Schedule yet but we should make the change and email  the parties on Susan's email so that everyone knows the latest changes and then ask if anyone has comments.  ss 
 Here's the message I just referneced.  ss 
 Lynn:  Weren't you going to take a look at the Trader Guidelines for Argentina?  Let me know if you have any questions or if I can help you further.  Thanks.  SS 
 Could you please print.  ss 
 Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).  I haven't heard any details.  It was originally planned to close after X-mas but maybe it will happen in the next few days.  FYI - I'll be out of the office after X-mas until next year.  SS 
 The account number in the confirmation is correct.  Please add "without duplication" language to the Floating Amount calculation. 
 I normally wouldn't forward these messages but this is funny!

 I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.  I would say for the most part that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers understand our position.  Big issues:  arbitration (I need an explanation in order to go to our general counsel) Limitiation of Liability  All else is negotiable.  SS 
 Enron Corp. has NOT agreed to: 1.  Credit Event Upon Merger 2.  Added Payer reps (or other tax related changes) 3.  Waiver of Jury Trial  I think Barclays may back down from the Cross Default changes. Sheryl wants to stet her changes to "Automatic Early Termination." Sheryl does need to see the other Ghost template changes.  Call if you have any questions.  713-853-5620  Sara 
 With respect to Part 2, Tax Reps and Part 5(l) deletion, the Enron Corp. tax group is fine with the changes (although these are not necessary).  Also, Enron will deliver forms as Barclays wishes.  Let me know if you have any questions. Sara 
 Scott,  Attached are the guidelines for Buenos Aires.  - - - Sara 
 Attached is the latest draft of the "Daily Call Option" confirmation between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  This is the same draft that Rodney received on Friday, Dec. 17. 
 1.  The Enron company is "ENA" 2.  How many Calculation Periods will there be?  December is a short month if the Transaction begins on 12/25/99.  Will the first payment be due  in early January?  If you intend three (3) payments to be made, then the Calc. Periods are from 12/25-12/31, January, 2/1-2/22. 3.  Is this a 24-hour index or is it limited to peak hours as defined by CAMMESA?  I left a message for Joe Hunter (confirmation desk - Ext. 33316) to be prepared for this Transaction.  Brent:  would you please verify the Floating Price?  Thanks. 
 Just to be certain that the EES entity that might enter into the swap is eligible, you should verify that it (1) has total assets in excess of $10 million or (2) has a net worth of $1 million and enters into the swap agreement in connection with the conduct of its business or to manage the risk of an asset or liability owned or incurred in the conduct of its business or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred in the conduct of its business. 
 fyi 
 Since the Master is drafted for ECT/TBS, what does your message mean in terms of moving the ISDA, guaranty and side letter along?  As I mentioned to Ted, what EI or an EI project company does outside of the ECT swap is not something that I can track.  Thanks.  SS 
 I have been unable to reach Ana Sonia by phone as she has not returned to t= he=20 office and has not returned my telephone calls.  So, we are preparing=20 execution copies of the ISDA and will have these signed by ENA.  We will fa= x=20 and Federal Express these to EDEN with a cover letter explaining to fax the= =20 signature page back, when they can expect the Enron Corp. guaranty and when= =20 we can expect their opinion of counsel.  I will also explain this to Ana=20 Sonia by separate fax.  I just spoke with Jeff Kable and explained this to= =20 him.  Susan Bailey is here all day but she is out next week (and I am out= =20 next week as well).  However, Marie Heard will help out next week.  Let me= =20 know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Automatic Termination Provision:  If the legal opinion required to be delivered by Counterparty pursuant to Part 3 of the Schedule to the Agreement is not delivered to ENA by December 29, 1999, then this Transaction shall automatically terminate on December 29, 1999 without further action or payment required by either party. 
 I did speak with Ana Soria.  Her only concern was the legal opinion.  I faxed her the format for the legal opinion and attached a cover sheet which indicated that ENA must receive the executed opinion by the close of business on December 29.  I've attached a copy of the fax cover sheet.  Also, Joe Hunter has added the "Automatic Termination" provision into the confirmation.  Have a happy holiday.  Sara 
 Pending execution of a master agreement, Amoco transactions continue to be documented under the omnibus.  Willie has brought to my attention three issues which continue to be raised by Amoco:  1.  Procedures for entering into Transactions: deletion of response within 2 Business Days after receipt of confirmation and failure to respond as conclusive evidence of Transaction  2.  Setoff:  there doesn't seem to be an "Affliliate" issue but I'm not certain of their comment to setoff applicable against a "derivative amount" (are they attempting to prevent setoff against physical amounts owing? or only trying to clarify that unpaid "derivative amounts" can be setoff against other amounts due?)  3.  Choice of law:  change to NY  I thought you could address these issues in your negotiations and let Willie know how to handle.  I've left confirm in your office.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I should be in immediately after my 8:30 am appointment.  Sara 
 Attached is the most recent draft of the guidelines.  Please let me have your comments.  Sara 
 Happy New Year, and, did we ever do a back-to-back (RMT/Enron Comercializadora Argentina) deal for this transaction? 
 I just received this message from Mark.  Let's talk and I can see what I can do.  I'm not aware of any written broker agreements used by ECT for trading other than those for futures and equities.  I can check on the physical side.  SS 
 Mark, we should rotate the desk (as per this email).  Shall I speak to the group or would you prefer to do it?  SS 
 Here's the original blackline.  Leave me a voice mail with the names and I'll revise my latest blackline today so that we can satisfy Cargil.  SS 
 see the doc below for making revisions.  ss 
 Attached is the form of guaranty (blacklined to the draft that Russell sent in early December) with my comments and Clement's comments.  Let's discuss and forward to Cargill.   SS 
 Happy New Year! Attached is a new draft of the Enron Corp. guaranty which incorporates Andrzej's comments of Dec., 1999 based upon exchanges with Russell Diamond (Enron credit - physical).  Tanya Rohauer (Enron credit - financial) is faxing Andrzej a copy of this guaranty as well. I need to catch up on our previous discussion regarding the Schedule; you should have received a draft of our Credit Support Annex just before the holidays.  I will touch base with you in a few days.  Sara 
 Deseret (omnibus) Empresa  Thanks.  ss 
 Per my voice mail, attached is the redlined version.  See Paragraph 4. Thanks.  ss 
 Attached is a draft SP 15 on peak confirm which you may send to Delano.  SS 
 Would you please give me a call to discuss the legal opinion.  After 10 am Houston time is fine.  Happy New Year.  SS 
 I have an 8:40 am eye doctor appointment tomorrow morning.  SS 
 Please have the attached guaranty executed.  SS 
 We received your lease information yesterday afternoon and will call early next week.  Sara 
 check  font size 
 Would you please supply me with the notice information required on page 4 of the draft Schedule.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be unable to conference on Jan.11.  I have no news to report other than we are finalizing Argentina financial trading guidelines.  Sara 
 Email Tambra for the remaining information.  SS 
 I shouldn't be too late.  ss 
 Joe:  see the attachment for a draft confirm. Pat:  Here's Julian's proposal. 
 Follow up from Brent - 
 Attached is a draft list of items for review.  Some of the items require immediate document  revisions; others require policy decisions before revising the documents.  Please edit and refine.  Mark suggested that we confer and come up with specific recommendations.  Once we create a list, let's try to meet on one or more occasions to discuss.  SS 
 Is anyone interested in joining me for Portuguese lessons?  Do you know anyone else who might be interested as well?  Sara 
 ENA has been negotiating an ISDA with Statoil.  I was advised by Chuck O'Brien this morning that Statoil also trades with ECTRIC and that he received an omnibus confirm from ECTRIC this morning.  Statoil will not sign the omnibus but would like to put an ISDA in place with ECTRIC and have the trade subject to that ISDA.  ENA should finalize its ISDA soon.  Would ECTRIC like to duplicate?  Happy New Year!  Sara 
 I hear that a binding agreement and/or PPA was signed with MOEMA for a 10-year transaction.  Do you have an English version of the MOU or PPA? Details?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Pat:  Do we need to talk? 
 Here's the confirm 
 Here's the attached termsheet 
 FYI:  Enron South America has requested a new account for CIESA deal.  I'm also forwarding Bruce's message which requests 2 accounts.  Sara 
 Second message from Bruce. 
 Attached are drafts for: (1)  Short cover letter to be signed by ENA (Scott Neal) requesting quotes (2)  Draft proposal for discussion purposes (3)  Draft confirmation format  Please review for accuracy and call/email to discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm still reviewing the ISDA but I asked Marie to prepare an omnibus to send Thurs. morning.  SS 
 As you may already know, Shari Stack will be handling this for ECT.  SS 
 Attached is my list of financial power deals.  Are there others? 
 Just to be on the safe side, are you familiar with this and/or should I call Rick if we have questions?  A second email to follow.  Thanks.  SS 
 the second email 
 FYI 
 Marie is not in the office today; your direct contact should be Susan Bailey (X 34737). I spoke earlier with Rick Hopkinson who indicated that the account will probably be for the benefit of EPCA. We need to verify a few details (account party, purpose, resolutions, authorized trader list, etc.).  Also, will the broker be Morgan? Nancy, since you will be working on the authorizations, please keep in mind that Ted Murphy will limit authorized traders to the Houston equity traders(and perhaps Bruce) for control purposes.  I believe we had to change the Enron Brazil Power Holding XII Ltd. resolutions in that regard.  I'll verify.  Susan and I will wait to hear from one of you in Sao Paulo.  I called about 10 minutes ago and no one was available.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Thanks for the tax article.  It's the published version of the one I sent to you in September, 99. Also, you were going to select a date at the end of January when we could teleconference to discuss Argentine issues, and, you were going to send to me the term sheet in use in Argentina.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please let me know what you think so that Nancy can forward to lawyers.  ss 
 I just wanted to touch base with you about efforts to keep good lines of communication between B.A. and Houston about trading activity in Argentina and Brazil (both financial and physical).  I participate in Randy's weekly conference calls and Brent tells me that you have now undertaken that role in B.A.  As you know, sometimes proposals and deals "slip through the cracks" and Houston is taken by surprise.  We want to remain current and proactive. Please feel free to leave me an email or voice mail when you learn of any relevant activitiy.  I , in turn, communicate directly with credit in Houston (Pat Cini or Rod Nelson) and tax in Houston (Lynn Aven or Rick Hopkinson or Michael Herman).  If you ever feel the need for a conference call, I'm always available and I'm sure credit and tax would be glad to join.  Also, I hold a weekly Friday conference call with Brent and Lynn to discuss current trading issues in Argentina and Brazil.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Should we invite one of the tax lawyers to our weekly meeting to discuss new forms and answer any tax questions?  ss 
 I don't know why you never received this message! 
 I am trying to distinguish these two types of entities both practically (what are we able to negotiate) and legally (what do we really need in our Schedule).  I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these parties.  ENA's form of "municipal" Schedule ("the ENA Schedule") was essentially taken from the 1992 ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule ("the ISDA Schedule").  In addition to other provisions, the ISDA Schedule (1) adds reps designed to avoid "an Orange County" type meltdown and (2) incorporates the concept of "Incipient Illegality" (which occurs before the Termination Event of  Illegality).  The "Incipient Illegality" concept is used  in Section 2(a)(iii) (obligations) as well as the Section 3 (reps) of the ISDA Schedule:   the concept is added to the Section 3(b) rep ("..absence of Event of Default, Potential Event of Default, Incipient Illegality...), and for purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence.  Interestingly enough, the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3(b) rep change.  I think we need to add this change to ENA's Schedule.  With respect to IOUs, we need to clarify our position on "Regulatory Development" (which is actually a watered-down "Incipient Illegality" concept).  If such an event occurs, ENA should be advised of the event (Notice).  But, does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at mid-market ("Additional Termination Event") or simply to have this event included as part of a Section 3(b) rep such that the occurrence of the event merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA's side of the curve (for breach of the Section 3(b) rep)?  I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the "Notice" provision can be difficult.  Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough.  Arguing for a Section 3(b) change may be easier (and would mirror the municipal format).  I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development (which we may only learn about through notice from the counterparty).  Thus, I recommend that for IOUs, we add a notice provision and Section 3(b) rep change incorporating our latest definition of "Regulatory Development."  But we really have to negotiate for this protection.  Otherwise, why bother to include this additional language?  What do you think? 
 I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the following comments:  (1)  I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities. However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for obvious errors.  (However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research on our behalf.  I'll discuss with him).  (2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on authority/regulatory issues.  In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than outside counsel's domicile.  (3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a "Regulatory Development" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we may also have a Termination Event under our current format). 
 Would someone please provide me with an explanation of the purpose of this account.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The financial trading group has a recurring request by our conterparties to add a provision addressing the admissability of trader tapes into evidence in court or other proceedings.  Our current language merely states:  "Each party consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any and all communications between officers or empoyees of the parties, and waives any further notice of such recording."  Here are the facts and issues:  1.  Our agreements provide for arbitration (most likely) or jurisdiction in specific courts or are silent as to jurisdiction.  2.  ENA policy is to destroy trader tapes after 6 months.  3.  If we are doing our job, a written and signed confirmation should exist in our files for each and every financial transaction.  On occasion, we have not confirmation signed by ENA's counterparty.  By agreeing to add "admissability" language, are we waiving the parol evidence rule?  Do we always want the ability to introduce existing recordings?  Can you provide us with language acceptable to ENA that we might propose to a counterparty (when asked)?  Here's an example of a recent request:  "Any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the prupose of extablishing any matters pertinent to the [ISDA] Agreement." 
 Please see attached.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I hope Bruce's explanation is sufficient!  Please call me if you have any other questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I don't know if you have spoken with Susan Flynn about her schedule before/after her surgery, but I have some questions that you may have already addressed, such as:  Has Susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation (i.e., existing masters, agreements to use ENA master/terminate counterparty master,etc.) with the various CES counterparties?  Carol mentioned that she could finalize this project.  Will someone receive be checking Susan's email and voice mail and physical mail each day?  What efforts (if any) are ongoing with respect to PGE?  What about existing files?  Top Tens (Swiss Re)?  Any ISDA comparisons could be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys.  Who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting?  Who is entering year-end deals onto Lotus Notes?  Should Susan Bailey handle per Carol's suggestion?  I'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding of how to handle the situation.  Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 Can you email a copy of the "Loan and Security Agreement" to me at sshackl@enron.com?  I can then redline suggested changes to your agreement. Thanks.  If you need to call, I'm at (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I am following up with MS but I haven't received your answer.  Will advise when I hear back.  SS 
 yes 
 Are the certificate(s) to be issued by BONY restricted or common?  (sounds like restricted and to be issued in the name of PEP)  I think that we can lodge the physical securities at MS (in the vault) for the account of Enron....Holdings XII with a stock power from PEP.  Are we headed in the same direction here?  SS 
 You'll need this draft for later use.  SS 
 Morgan Stanley has advised me this morning of the following with respect to accounts:  1.  The name of the account must be identical to the name of the certificate holder. 2.  An account holding only a certificate(s) is subject to a minimum equity requirement of USD 500,000.  As the certificate holder is the Brazilian company PEP, the broker will require additonal equity.  I am still awaiting a broker response as to whether the certificate holder can execute a stock power in favor of the account holder thereby enabling us to lodge the certificate(s) in the existing (Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII) account.   Alternatively, the certificate(s) can be held in the Enron Corp. vault.  Robert, when do you need to respond to BONY? 
 Could someone please follow up on the status of this CP.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I would like to take the following days in February as vacation days:  February 3,4,18  Please let me know if this presents a conflict.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'll need the file - 
 Gosh, I had totally forgotten!!  That Friday makes for a long President's Day weekend which I was trying to arrange.  Will this lunch be too difficult to reschedule?  Just let me know.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  Are you feeling better?  You missed our group meeting.  I asked what I thought was an innocent question about the legal survey database since it was related to part of our discussion.  BIG MISTAKE.  Tana was explosive.  Sorry you missed it. 
 McISDA is sprouting Golden Arches.  Although we have a serious legal issue, I think the CP really wants to develop a long term relationship with Enron and will overcome the problem.  Also, CP is interested in eliminating a Credit Support Annex and will call Tanya (or already has called her).  Call me and I'll give you the scoop.  Sara 
 The ADR certificate(s) can be directed to Donna Lowry for safekeeping as follows:  Enron North America Corp. EB 2407 1400 Smith Street Houston, Texas  77002  Donna is a compliance officer  for ENA and affiliates.  You can reach her at 853-1939. 
 I have been receiving the "Enron International Southern Cone" list of projects (updated weekly) for the B.A. office for quite some time.  As you know, it covers trading Projects and Claims/Litigation/Regulatory.  Is there a similar list prepared for projects originating in Brazil?  I would like to recieve such a list as would the parties copied above.  Please let me know. Regards.  Sara 
 You should contact ECT's counterparties periodically throughout the negotiation process, as warranted.  Please call NYSEG to follow up.  Also, Carol is reviewing the PSE&G comparison so please call her and you guys can review the ISDA together.  If you are uncertain as to how to keep in touch with our counterparties, please chat with me.  Thanks.  SS 
 We are currently updating our database of brokerage agreements for Ted Murphy.  We only show two (2) executed agreements for ECTRIC and/or UK SPVs. These include agreements that ECTRIC has with Fimat Futures UK Limited and Paribas Futures, Inc.  If other such agreements have been executed, would you please advise and send copies to Houston.  Ted will now keep a duplicate set of agreements. Also, would any other European locations have executed brokerage or futures agreements?  If you have any questions, please call. Regards.  Sara 
 ENA can confirm the transaction on our "omnibus confirmation" with one or two minor changes (Joe:  please call me). Also, ENA sent a draft ISDA Master Agreement to Puget Sound Energy on 3/9/99.  If you anticipate more financial trading, please let me know as we should pursue execution of the ISDA Master Agreement.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please respond. Thanks.  SS 
 Mark:  have you spoken with Brent  or the Marval firm about this?  Please call me when you have a chance.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Have you and Mark ever discussed this?  Have you spoken with Marval?  I'd really like some more information.  Thanks.  SS  P.S.  Is tomorrow a holdiay in BA? 
 FYI 
 Please call me after you have reviewed the attached Loan and Security Agreement.  Sara x3-5620 
 Can we schedule a conference call?  Sara 
 I have two (2) tickets for "Wit" playing at the Alley Theatre for Friday, Feb. 11 (8 pm, Sec. 4, Row G).  Let me know if you are interested.  No charge.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Let's enter into the database.  I'll meet with you shortly to discuss further.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a redline based upon the document generated by you.  I'm sure there will be many items for discussion and I look forward to hearing from you.   Regards.  Sara 
 Happy New Year!  I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine commercial group.  They have told me the following:  (1)  An association known as the "Argentine Association of Derivatives" has developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for use in the near term.  It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA.  It is a "short" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex).  (2)  This document is being prepared by experienced professionals.  Are you involved in this effort?  Is ISDA involved?  Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing. If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara 
 Let's verify that this is an IOU.  The Master should be sent to the attention of Dave Brown and you should advise Cary of when it was sent to the customer.  He may want a copy.  ps  Remind me to give you both copies of Tana's utility analysis.  Also, Marie, let's talk about the utility language and circulate for comment. 
 Happy New Year!  Just wondering if you had an opportunity to review the CSA and comment.  Drop me a line or call 713/853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I would like to pursue with Marval.  Should we meet to discuss?  Sara 
 Joe Hunter no longer handles financial power.  Please refer to names below. Thanks.  Sara 
 Brent:  Gabby Aguilar(?) from BA has requested Lynn for an "immediate white paper" addressing tax issues for physical (power, gas and I don't know what else) and financial trading in Argentina.  What phone call on Thursday were you referring to on your voice mail?  I'll try to call you in about an hour. Sara 
 I still need to revise the agreement for the bank/broker.  I need the exact name of the lender and an addressee. Smith Barney was sent to Steve Piasio. Thanks.  Sara 
 Here's my goof!  Give me a call.  Sara 
 The draft is ready to go but we need one (1) item from credit.  Hopefully, this should be resolved within the hour!  Do you want a copy?  SS 
 Lynn will come to my office at 9 am.  Julian will try to be here too but he has an 8am meeting and may be late.  I can call you if you like, but just let me know which number.  SS  P.S.  Shall I just schedule a call with you and Mark? 
 Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.  To my knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17 doesn't mention Mark).  So, I'm totally confused.  If we are going to discuss the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.  If you want to cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and advise Lynn and Julian).  Thanks. 
 Let me know if you have comments or want to discuss further. P.S. to Rod:  We need to talk about Basin 
 I spoke briefly with Gary Perlmutter who now represents the parent Sempra Energy but who told me that restrictions on the regulated utility have been lifted by the CA PUC.  I will verify (or I'll give you his name, etc. and you can speak with him directly) when the SDG&E lawyer returns my call.  Thus I am not sure that your online efforts require limitation.  I will also inquire about SDG&E's online objectives.  SS 
 I'm available as well.  Sara 
 Of course.  Just let me know what deadline you would like.  SS 
 I am finalizing the docs and we should coordinate with Julian.  You may want to let Scott Neal know that we will need his signature.  SS 
 That will be fine.  Sara 
 Holly Krebbs just did a deal with these guys (short form) but they want to negotiate an ISDA.  We need to send an updated form to them.  Will there be any credit changes? 
 Central Puerto has been unresponsive to Marie's requests for original documents.  Can someone please contact Marie and help us speak with the counterparty?  Thanks.  Sara 
 See attached letter 
 We will need to update this ISDA on our new, revised, fantastic format!!! I'll have to find out who to send it to.  SS 
 FYI - Brent please call.  Sounds like we ought to accelerate our plan.  SS 
 Could this be an alternative to our recording issue? 
 Thanks.  SS 
 Attached is a short letter advising subs/affiliates of ENA of existing brokerage and futures accounts.  I thought these should be sent to the general counsel and CFO/Treasurer of each company.  Please let me know your comments, frequency of review, whether any other group should monitor, etc. Each attached Exhibit will contain only a list of accounts.  I have not included account numbers but we can do so and include any other information you consider relevant.  Remember, the only other "brokerage account matrix" which we have produced is a quick view of brokerage firms and Enron companies.   Thanks. 
 In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that the definition of "Loss" picks up the concept of "Unpaid Amounts."  Arguably it does (although the concept of "Unpaid Amounts" is built into the ECT Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date). My guess is that we decided that Omnibus "Loss" pv of economic loss includes both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.  Can you recall? 
 Can we schedule a short call on Tuesday to discuss the local Argentine derivatives issue?  I am not free at 10 - 11 am or after 2:30 pm. Houston. Also, have you been able to confirm whether Don is the man in charge in Brazil?  Sara 
 Great!  I'll call you at 1pm Houston time.  SS 
 Just received this message this very minute.  The draft already went.  Sorry. 
 Who is handling the amendment? 
 Can you give me a little more info on this topic?  Is anyone in Houston involved?  I just want to make certain that we haven't missed anything in the process.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - I will be out of the office on Feb. 3 and 4.  Let me know if you want to reschedule earlier.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to the distinction between "investor owned utilities" (or "IOUs") and municipal utilities (or "municipals") in connection with derivatives activity.  In the U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.  Thus, we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance in its state public utility commission proceedings.  A copy of that Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.  Our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different.  When negotiating an ISDA Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of "Incipient Illegality" and an enforceability opinion.  A copy of that Schedule is also attached for your reference.  We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).  In that regard, would you recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format? 
 Should we be entrenched in this type of activity?  I'm not even sure that we find out about all of ESA's ideas.  Sara 
 What is the issue?  I have no idea if anyone is looking at this.  Sara 
 It sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring!  I have been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some type of "Deal Report".  In Houston and Argentina, the business groups circulate a transaction listing.  Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina circulate a listing from Legal's perspective. Is a commercial team deal report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the circulation?  I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.  It would be helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.  In that regard, what is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?  I am glad to prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.),  Let's coordinate for the seminar which you are organizing for March.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Looks like he's an expat in Singapore. 
 Definitely Thursday or Friday - just let me know so that I don't leave and lock it up! 
 Just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the "advisory memo" to be sent to the Enron subs/affiliates regarding brokerage agreements.  I have no real deadlines, only a self-imposed deadline so that we can get this thing organized and running on a regular basis.  I would appreciate your input. I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 7&4; maybe we can chat early next week. Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan should have already checked with the counterparty.  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Jeff Nogid has called about putting some ENE masters in place.  I have already spoken with Clement about this.  ENE will be trading FX, interest rate and equities through Gary's group.  Jeff mentioned names such as Merrill Lynch Cap. Services, Credit Suisse and Sumitomo.  He will obtain specific names and contacts at the various firms and forward that information to me and/or Shari.  We'll let you know.  Sara 
 Under separate cover, I will fax to you a copy of the February 6, 1998 legal opinion which, from my research, created the "issue"  between SG&E and Enron North America Corp., formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  It might be easiest if SD&G reissues the opinion without the qualification contained in Paragraph 5.  Please let me know what you think.  Regards.  Sara 
 I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty.  Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that you would normally grant?  If so, who has issued the opinion?  I look forward to your reply.  Regards.  Sara 
 I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 & 4. Carol is attending a class on Feb. 3. Please direct inquiries to lawyers present on those two days. Kaye Ellis knows how to reach me in Baton Rouge. 
 I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.  The CP is anxious to receive an ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions. Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).  Thanks.  Sara 
 James Hardie Australia Finance Pty. Limited Thanks for the response. I'll let you know what I conclude (or am able to negotiate!). Please keep me updated.  Sara 
 Absolutely! 
 Tracy Ngo will be preparing credit for an ISDA.  The draft should be sent to (Steve) Morus at the CP (check the green file because we've done an omnibus).  You can insert NY law but no other omnibus changes need to be made.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Test sent message, please reply.   Felix. 
 Sorry for the extreme delay in getting back to you.  I have not forgotten and will get to this as soon as possible.  Sara    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 reply test2.  Felix 
 Drop by.  We've been trading financial power for over a year.  Not many deals, though.    Enron North America Corp. 
 We need a new ISDA using our current form changes.  Sara 
 FYI - we may need to revise.  Does this ISDA have our new changes? 
 email address is correct but I am not Carol St. Clair (the next name in your list). 
 We need to contact these guys before our legal/credit meeting.  Let me know if you want me to make the contact.  SS 
 Have you sorted through the ENE ISDA masters with Jeff Nogid?  Should I call him again?  Anyway, it looks like another request is attached.  Sara 
 I never heard back from you last week.  Can we continue to send this report monthly?  Some addressees have changed.  Sara 
 Feb. 17 is good for me. 
 check voice mail message.  need GT&C to make this go.  ss 
 Trying to set up conference call with Tiger (will advise).  Enron Corp. lawyer out of town until tomorrow afternoon; trying to find another Corp. lawyer to review the guaranty.  Also, received e-mail from Harvard asking when I'd respond.  Is this just a routine request?  SS 
 Was the meeting this morning cancelled?  Rick Hopkinson and I waited for about fifteen minutes.   Sara 
 Does this sound familiar? 
 Hi!  I'm the ENA lawyer with whom you will be speaking with respect to this Master Agreement.  I know that Marie Heard has called you regarding your review of this document and I was hoping to facilitate that discussion. Please let me know if you have specific questions and/or if we can schedule a conference call.  You can reach me via email of (713) 853-5620.  Thanks. Sara 
 per my voice mail 
 Are we also trying to put an ISDA in place? 
 Sounds like an interesting meeting.  SS 
 I received a call from Jay Boudreaux (CTG group working with paper & pulp) about presenting "agreements" to the lender (Paribas) for review in connection with the loan for construction of the mill.  I know that Jarrod has prepared "draft confirms" for these companies but I don't know if anyone has raised the ISDA issue.  Sounds like too many hands in the pot but the bank may really need to see Master Swap Agreements.  Let me know if this has already been addressed.  Thanks.  Sara 
 (1)  I have to leave early this evening to pick up pets (about 5:45)  (2)  Just a thought after seeing Shari's email:  would the paralegals and/or lawyers benefit from the two seminars "Successful Working Relationships" (valuing differences; creating understanding)?  Should this be mandatory with some type of follow up to help improve group communication skills? 
 I am in the process of finalizing the ISDA and need for you to provide me with a definition of the "Cross Border Lease"  for insertion into Paragraph 12 of the Credit Support Annex.  I will need to refer to the lease in several places.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm always in town.  Just let me know when you're going to be downtown. Nothing new here either!  Just work, work, work.  I hope to get away for the fourth but one never knows.  SS      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I generally don't forward this kind of stuff but this seemed interesting - 
 Why not?  I offered him the opportunity to choose his "investment Bar Mitzvah gift"!!!!  (or else I make the selection in his behalf) 
 What is a cardio cath?  Was she having problems.  Zach is not a little guy. I'm going for an allergy shot.  I'm so tired that I'm getting to be boring. I wish Mother had email.  We could have 3-way discussions.  Sas 
 Ed,  Sara asked me to forward this agreement to you.  She said you can send it to ABN AMRO Bank.  Kaye 
 fyi 
 713-646-3490 
 Here's the document.  I'll bring the changes to you shortly.  Thanks.  Sara 
 As we just discussed.  SS 
 Can we get together and review the outstanding issues?  How about this afternoon or tomorrow morning?  Sara 
 Thank you, dahling, for the lovely card.  I'm thinking of you as well (but I ALWAYS think of you).  I'll be thinking of you when I am in New York and especially when I pass by Ferragamo.  And when I pass by Tiffany's.  I hope your day is filled with valentines.  Love,  Sas 
 How about 9 am tomorrow morning in my office? 
 This was the "explanation" that I forwarded to Shari for dealing with Canadian utilities, munis, etc.  I'll follow up with her when you have identified specific  Canadian counterparties or provinces which are needed for EOL.  Sara 
 Is 9 am OK? 
 Can you please advise of legal holidays in Brazil during the remainder of February and March?  I don't know how many days Mardi Gras/lent last.  I need to plan future trips to Sao Paulo.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Would you please send a calendar of legal holidays in Argentina for 2000?  At the moment, I need to plan for the remainder of February and March.  Thanks. Sara 
 Sami:  Can we schedule a short conference call to discuss?  I am in the office all week except for Friday (and Monday, February 21 is a legal holiday in the U.S.)  Please let me know your availability.  Maybe you can select from the following this week:  Tues, 2/15:  10:30 am until 1 pm, after 2 pm  Wed., 2/16:  9 am until 10 am, 11am until 2 pm, after 3 pm  Thurs., 2/17:  1 pm until 4 pm  All of the foregoing times are Houston times. Also, I am trying to verify holidays in Brazil for the remainder of the year.  Is Bracewell looking at early or late March?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Great! 
 I will have the letter executed.  I changed references in third to last paragraph to read "ECT" rather than "Enron" and replaced Bill Coffman's name wtih Robert Loughran, ext. 142.  Do you assume responsibility to transmitting to Canadian immigration or do we?  Please explain the process.  Thanks.  Sara    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 FYI:  Ed Quinn advises that he is once again in negotiations with P&G for a 5 year, 50,000T/yr SWAPTION.  When our prior negotiations with P&G were halted, we were waiting to review P&G's proposed alternative (or variation) to "non-reliance". 
 Would you please incorporate all holidays for Enron Corp., Enron Argentina and ESB (Brazil) onto my calendar?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a clean and redline version of your document with Enron North America Corp.'s suggested changes.  Please call me to discuss when you have had an opportunity to review.  Also, does your document contain "coding" information?  I was a bit confused by some of the characters appearing in your version.  Regards.  Sara  (713)  853-5620 (phone) (713)  646-3490 (fax) 
 I will be out of the office on Friday.  Monday is President's Day.  Shari or Carol may be available on Friday.  Sara 
 1.  At the end of the "Notice of Exercise" clause, ass"(but not both)"  2.  Instead of "Additional Provisions", insert the following:  Special Provisions:  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise by the Buyer of the option to enter into either Underlying Transaction I or Underlying Transaction II is conditioned upon (i) the execution by the parties on or before the Expiration Date of an ISDA Master Agreement and (ii) Enron Corp. Risk Assessment and Control approval [of what?].  In the event that either/both (?) condition is not satisfied prior to the Expiration Date, this Transaction shall terminate on such date without further action or payment required by either party. 
 Thurs:  between 12 -4 Tues:  between 11 - 2, after 3 
 Patricia:  I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection with our discussion of last week.  I can't recall if you were going to try to speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically, with respect to the template currently in circulation.  I think you were also going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association. Please advise when you have further information.  I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.  I am considering a trip to BA during the week of February 28.  Will you be in town that week? During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation. Regards.  Sara 
 I am planning a trip to BA from Feb. 27 - March 3.  The objective will be to present derivatives training for the BA traders, meet with tax and legal representatives and the Argentine Derivatives Association with respect to changing tax laws, legislation, and "local" derivatives trading, and sitting down with Mike Guerriero to establish an "action plan".  The monthly swap calendar does not indicate other lawyers out of the office during that week. Please note this on the group calendar.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  Mark - let me know if there are other issues you would like to have addressed. 
 the lawyer, of course!  SS 
 FYI - You ought to choose one of these and start putting away money on a regular basis.  You'll be rich one day!!!!  Sas 
 yes, where? 
 Patricia:  Thanks very much for your quick response.  I would very much like to solicit your help in arranging some meetings when Lynn Aven (tax) and I visit BA in two weeks.  We definitely want to meet with one or more members of the ADA who are responsible for drafting and implementing the new agreement.  And your suggestion to meet with your colleague who has been lobbying for derivatives tax legislation is one we readily accept.  Could you possible try to schedule these for convenient times on Tuesday and Wednesday, February 29 and March 1, respectively?  I will be out of the office tomorrow but in next week.  Enron is closed on Monday,  February 21 for President's Day.  Let me know if you would like to speak directly of if I can assist in any way.  Looking forward to our visit.  Sara 
 Attached is the Media News draft confirm.  Paul will call about that one. Traders will book new deal and kill prior transaction with Affiliated Newspapers.  (notice the merger and/or name change issues????) 
 I'm waitlisted on the Continental flight so we may be traveling separately. I do, however, have a room reservation at the Sheraton Towers.  Kaye can help you.  I'm out of town tomorrow so let's regoup on Tuesday.  SS 
 Lynn and I will be in BA during the week of Feb. 28 to meet with lawyers, accountants, commercial group, etc.  Just a heads up for you.  Sara 
 let's talk on Tuesday, dude 
 Congratulations!  What a great story for future generations.  Love, Sara 
 I will not be able to attend this afternoon's meeting as I have a doctor's appointment.  Also, I am looking forward to hearing details of Friday's luncheon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The ball's in my court to respond to Basin.  sara 
 am I nuts? 
 I don't think Marie handled yet.  Please handle and advise Brent that you are the person working on Argentina.  Also, we can send the latest deal report which we should discuss briefly (and the new list of addressees).  Thanks. Sara 
 Patricia:  Just checking to see if you received this message from last week and how the arrangements were proceeding.  Please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara 
 looks fine with me 
 Credit has not received financials.  Can you help out here to get the ball rolling?  Sara 
 Please see attahed.  Let me know if you have questions about the  option template and please let me know if you think the Delano draft satisfies the conversation we just had with Leslie.  Thanks.  Sara 
 In connection with the trip to BA next week, I am having some problems scheduling meetings with other consultants and would like to know whether you have been able to schedule a meeting on Tuesday (Feb. 29) or Wednesday (March 1) with your colleagues and/or the ADA.  I would appreciate hearing from you as quickly as possible in the morning because I already have requests to meet on those two days.  I would obviously like to defer to your plans.  Please call me tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'm receiving mine!!!  But I'll be in Buenos Aires next week so I'll keep my fingers crossed that my computer is working (in the event any further earth shattering Lehrer family announcements occur).  My mom does not know how to turn the computer on but she does have an email address.  We better wait until she "gets comfortable" with the concept of email before handing out her address.  At this very minute, my dad is returning from a convention in Atlantic City.  He called me from the airport on his CELL PHONE.  You see, it took me some time to get him to carry his cell phone with him.  I'VE SUCCEEDED!  Talk to you soon, Mr. Webmaster.  Sara 
 FYI 
 I think Tanya worked on this.  FYI, I'll be in Argentina next week.  SS 
 That will work just fine!  Just let me know where to meet.  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Patricia has asked who should be included in the group for Wednesday, March 1.  Do you and Andrea want to be included?  Any commercial people? 
 We do not have the answer for you at this time.  It must be researched.  Sara    Enron North America Corp. 
 Whatever you can do is most welcome.  We are only limited by time.  We have set aside the entire day of Wednesday, March 1 for you to schedule.  We can also be available late Monday afternoon, February 28.  I will advise shortly with respect to local invitees.  Thanks very much.  Sara 
 no 
 Only to make sure that we (especially Lynn Aven) can speak with your tax partner with respect to derivatives issues.  Thanks.  Sara 
 We'll do that and resend. 
 It's OK this time.  The Determination Period in this confirm is confusing; exchange-based price sources should be tied to the delivery month/Determination Period. 
 Patricia:  Thanks for putting the meetings together.  In addition to Lynn Aven and me, both Andrea Calo and Brent Hendry would like to attend.  I'm looking forward to visiting with you next week.  Regards.  Sara 
 I received a message from Augustin David to return his call to discuss the master.  The number he left rings but does not answer.  I have tried calling several times.  Maybe we can talk to him next week when I am in BA.  Sara 
 I'll let them know. It's very possible that one or both will be unable to attend due to the office activity but they both want to be available.  Thanks again.  Sara 
 Please change on my calendar 
 FYI 
 FYI - Shari Stack is negotiating the brokerage agreement with Banc One and there seems to be an issue over the interest rate.  Needless to say, I have never had any conversations with Banc One over this issue.  SS 
 Carol:  I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.  I think credit should have a "separate worksheet" and make a determination for each question you've listed.  For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.  One issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a different level.  How does credit identify the counterparty, much less determine if that counterparty is an ESP?  I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be inadequate.  And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?  A separate list would help in the evaluation.  Are we going to have another credit lunch?  Hope all is going well.  Sara 
 Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29. The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc.  Please let me or Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.  Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants. Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.  Sami has been diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of references to PPA's and SWAPS.  We are still trying to get our arms around all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.  Have you heard from Yao?  This international position may be right up his alley. Sara 
 Attached is the origination list from Brazil. SS 
 Sami:  I'm concerned about the deals showing up on the origination list which we received on Friday.  There are multiple references to swaps.  We need to talk. I'm in Argentina and may not make the call tomorrow because I have meeting outside the office.  I'll try to call you tomorrow.  sara 
 With respect to this counterparty, you may continue to agree to these IDENTICAL early termination provisions until otherwise notified by credit.  SS 
 Chuck:  I am currently in our Buenos Aires office for the week.  I have to resolve our few issues when I return to Houston.  I can tell you, however, that we cannot agree to provide you with the legal opinion as to enforceability as we discussed in our conversation last week.  I'll follow up with you next week.  Sara 
 Where do you want to go? 
 Susan:  This report should also be routed to the Argentine traders and, in Brazil, only Sami Arap (delete Robert George and Andrea Bertone).  Thanks. Sara 
 I think that the reference may be in the setoff clause and the CP was trying to exclude "other Transactions" and limit setoff to derivatives only. Unfortunately, I don't have the form with me.  SS 
 Just kidding!  I'm fine.  I've been cut off twice on telephone calls to the states so I may have problems calling you in the next hour or so when I leave the office.  FYI: NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.  It's too early for the mutual fund reports.  The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for lunch and they were much better than tamales.  I read the tamale article in the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS (whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales were really HOT).  Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.  Thursday and Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an agreement.  I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).  Love, the DG 
 Would you please add me to th distribution list for clippings.  Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 I hope you are doing well.  I finally have my laptop so I can at least read email during the day.  The weather here is gorgeous.  It's about 72 during the day and cooler at night.  We went to a restaurant that had a "tunnel of fudge" por d'creme.  Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in the Charlie Trotter cookbook.  Do you have that cookbook?  I know you have a lot of them.  I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday morning at 6:30 am.  Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.  How's mother and daddy? I can't send mother email because she may pick it up on her voice mail. Love, sas  PS  Are you working on Friday? 
 When do I get to see you?  What are you doing for the fourth?  When are you going to visit Miami?  When do you want to eat sushi?  SS 
 I have meetings this morning with the Marval firm but was hoping you could help out here. 1.  Could you please check with the Alley Theatre Box Office and find out if I have tickets for a performance this Friday night (March 3).  They will check under the name "McKeogh" and my local phone number "713 664-3207". Just let me know so that I can figure out what to do.  2.  Could you please change my McDonald's phone call presently scheduled for 1pm (BA time) tomorrow.  I would need to reschedule through Mike Irgang(info in lotus notes) at McDonald's and let Ed Quinn know.  My BA schedule is on my calendar.  3.  I am tentatively planning a trip to Sao Paulo.  I will stay from 3/17 through 3/27.  However, I need to arrive on 3/16 and depart on 3/28.  Could you please check flight availability?  I first need to clear through Mark Taylor and I will copy you on that message.  Thanks. for now. 
 Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss. There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the commercial group and the lawyers as follows:  1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization) 2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)  I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio). Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara 
 You are brilliant!  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Hi Felix!  I return from Argentina this weekend.  I am having some problems with the laptop which I'll need you to adjust upon my return. I am traveling with an ESA person from Houston who has a laptop and never experiences any of the daily problems which I have.  The problems are:  1.  Immediately upon logging in each day, I receive the following message: "This install. will install CITRIX ICA Client  - YES or NO"  2.  "Unable to load workspace file destop.dsk.  File is in use by another program.  Delete the file and create a new workspace?"  Also, the screen freezes frequently and I'm not sure what this is related to.  I can't use the laptop offline to even get into word. When can we review these problems?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rod and Susan:  I met with the counterparty and lawyer last week.  Following are the results: Rod:  CP would like a phone call to discuss the Schedule and CSA.  They mainly want explanations as to why ENA made the elections in the docs for: 1.  p.1 Cross Default Threshold 2.  p. 2 Additional Event of Default, part (xi) 3.  p. 4  issue providing Quarterly Unaudited Consolidated financials 4.  CSA p.2:  How was Collateral Threshold determined  Susan:  CP would like the following: 1.  Schedule p. 3:  sample certificates per third entry for docs to be delivered 2,   "                p. 5:  need to get address 3.   "                p. 6:  Process Agent.  Need to provide CP into on CT Corp.  You will need to speak with Julian Poole because the CP has fairly good English (the lawyer does not speak English) and Julian may want to schedule the call.  I don't know how quickly the CP will want to act because there is a Stamp Tax issue to be resolved.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Lynn:  I would like to standardize procedures for Argentina as much as possible (this week while fresh in my mind).  Attached is Julian's message to Houston.  Is this OK to put into email?  Let me know when you have time to breathe.  Also, in terms of an updated memo on Argentina issues, should I add to what you write or vice-versa?  My thought is to essentially update/modify the legal memo written in Dec., 1997 that Brent gave to us.  Let me know. Thanks.  Sara 
 Per my email, you will need Julian on the phone due to the language problem. All else is in Lotus Notes.  Sara 
 This is my favorite new game.  Also, the latest issue of "Wine Spectator" has a photo of Charlie Trotter on the cover.  SS 
 This if fine for me.  SS
