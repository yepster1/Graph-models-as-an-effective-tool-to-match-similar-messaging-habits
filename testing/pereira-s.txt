ry to work on her.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 David-  Is the meeting on for April 2?  Susan 
 Ok, here's the plan.....  Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the evening flight (?).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later I guess.  Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel reservations there?  Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't wait.  Susan 
 I would like to have a spot in the new garage.  Susan W. Pereira 
 Hi, Jan.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman has updated us on your mother's condition.  I know it must be stressful, especially from long distance.  Kali liked her birthday gifts.  Believe it or not, we didn't already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the kids liked it.  I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was wondering what your travel schedule was in June.  When will you be arriving, when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling without us on the plane), etc.  The earliest we could leave for Brazil would be the evening of Friday, July 6.  We would probably need to return to Houston by July 14.  Let me know how that sounds.  Also, if we need to reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, let me know.  That's certainly more important.  Talk to you soon.....  Susan 
 David-  I just got back in town.  Monday the 2nd will work for me.  Susan 
 In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price. He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.  Susan     Enron North America Corp. 
 I sent in a check for $200 for deposits for my daughter and son.  They are both going for two weeks.  I thought the deposit was $50/wk per child.  Susan Pereira 
 Thanks.  I did not do a T5.  Susan Pereira 
 Please take me off your mailing list!! 
 David-  I got the email you forwarded to me.  Have you responded to Suzanne Sugarbaker yet?  I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to forward my email address to her.  If I don't hear back from you today, I will probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's "presentation," I've spoken with Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.  Thanks,  Susan  P.S.- Please email me back today at our home email address : pereira@houston.rr.com.  I'm leaving early for a doctor appt. 
 Julie-  I left my paperwork in the green box at your doorstep yesterday.  I wanted to make sure you received it.  I'll be out of town until March 25, so if you have any questions, I won't be able to respond until then.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Stevens-  We've moved up the food chain at Destin, but have not received a response yet.  I'll be out next week.  Check with Joe Casas to see if he hears anything  Susan 
 Hi, Jan!  I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant. When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave. We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early April to get seats.  Talk to you soon.  Susan  P.S.-  Happy Birthday early!! 
 Margaret-  Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's class booth--all at different times.  I don't think we'll  be able to help all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than happy to help Mary out.  Susan Pereira 
 Kathy-  Is it safe to assume that practice is ca
