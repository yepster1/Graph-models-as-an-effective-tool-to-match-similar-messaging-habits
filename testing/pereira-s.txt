pper doll or a bath set in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.  Susan  P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday. 
 I would like to cancel my registration for this class.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Rob-  From now on, I think Nelson Ferries (w/Enron) will be handling all our short term wellhead purchases.  He may have talked to you already.   His number is 713-853-3061.  Thanks.  Susan Pereira 
 My location is EB 3223F.  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?  How many kids are in the class and who is the instructor?  Also, are there any group lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?  Are the classes large?  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 We'll plan to come to the camp.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  Since we last emailed, something has come up on Sunday afternoon.  Would it be possible to do the lesson earlier, like 11 am or noon?  Or, Kali has Monday the 19th off and could do a lesson anytime that day.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Looks fine, Jan.  Thanks for taking care of this for us.  Let me know the exact amount if the exchange rate changes.  I'll give a check to Papi to deposit in your account.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman told us of your struggles to get the medication you need.  I hope things work out.  How are the kids doing?  Kali and Michael are very excited that school is almost out--just two more weeks. They can't wait for Alexia and Sebastien to get here.  See you soon..  Love,  Susan 
 I am not available for any recruiting at this time.\  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  I was just checking to see if Sunday, Feb. 18 at 3 pm would work for Kali's last private lesson.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...  Take care.  Susan 
 Thanks for  your help.  Susan 
 Paul-  Please take me off your email list for University of Chicago candidates.  I have not been involved in any recruiting efforts.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Thanks  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  Just checking on whether there will be a lesson time available on Sunday afternoon.  Saturday late afternoon might work for us as well.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira  (Kali Pereira) 
 Kathy-  Thursdays at 6:30 will generally work for us; however, on Thursday the 15th we unfortunately have a conflict.  Can you send me the list of girls who are on the team?  I know Kali is curious whether she knows anyone or not.  Thanks,  Susan 
 Dave-  There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements?? For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut down on trades made in error.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 I don't have any issues.  Thanks,  Susan     Enron North America Corp. 
 The three indices are 9.81,9.89 and 9.97;  the average is $9.89.  So, the contract price is $9.89 + .01 less .2422 transport on the net of fuel volumes.  If you invoice on gross volumes you will need to deduct the value of the fuel (0.3%).  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Either day will work for me.  Susan Pereira 
 I can be there.  Susan 
 Sunday at 3 pm will work.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 I am resending this, as I have not received any reply.  Susan Pereira 
 Thanks for keeping up with that, Chris.  Susan 
 Ruth-  I've been trying to call you back since last night, but your line is always busy.  I'd be happy to drive on Saturday.  Shall I call everyone?  Other than Jazz and Kali, I'll need to pick up Francie, Angela and Amy, right?  Any more?  Thanks,  Susan 
 At the Enron camp, how are the age groups combined?  For example, are 5-7 year olds together, 8-10 year olds, etc....?  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Thanks.  I'll come by between 4:45 and 5:30.  Susan Pereira 
 We'll be there at 4 pm on Sunday.  Thanks  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  Would a private lesson be available on Saturday or Sunday at 4 pm?  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  Kali will be there at 2 pm Sunday the 14th for a private lesson.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Helen-  Is a stand-by time available for Sunday afternoon around 2 pm?  The lesson would be for my daughter Kali.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Leslie-  Have you sent any confirmation to El Paso stating our agreement with the imbalance and that it has been transferred to ENA?  Susan 
 Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume statement.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Whoops!  I goofed.  The transport deduct on gross volumes (including fuel value) is $.2602.  The transport deduct on net volumes is $.2422.  Sorry for the confusion.  Susan 
 My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.  The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 0.3% fuel. The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% fuel.  Please let me know if this is not your understanding.  Also, please keep in mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this production.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Stevens-  I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.  The transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.  This should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in transportation costs from the pipeline.  From my calculations, deducts from gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct., $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks  Susan Pereira 
 Jane-  I've corrected  the transport and fuel deducts in sitara and e-mailed the EOTT  folks.  Thanks  Susan
