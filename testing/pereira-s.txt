r jobs.  Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.  We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.  Hope everything is going well for you.  How is your house coming along??  Send me a note back.  I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.  They start laying off people next week.  It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.  Merry Christmas!!  Take care,  Susan 
 I expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow.  We will likely be defaulting on a lot of our December business.  There are some last ditch efforts going on, but I'm not very hopeful.  If we file bankruptcy, I think we'll all get at least 60 days pay.  There were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway.  I guess those will happen.  I don't know.  They may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first.  Stay tuned.... 
 Craig-  You might want to talk to Ormet concerning deliveries for December.  It is very likely we may have to default to them for December.  We have NYMEX length and may be able to use some hub gas to transport to Ormet.  I don't know which deals will be served first.  Susan Pereira 
 That's fine, Stevens. 
 Sounds like a great idea, Ana.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira

 Good testimonial!  I hope they print it. 
 Guess what?  I got a response from Ken on my email to him.  In fact, he responded just a few days after I wrote him, but his assistant didn't send it back to me until today.  He hand wrote a response on the printout of my email.  Susan 
 Thanks, Stephanie 
 You're the best! 
 Ana-  I think I am signed up as an alternate for the field trip on Thursday.  Do you know if I'll be needed?  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 I've left a message with my contact at Vintage.  I haven't heard back yet.  I do know that in Oct and Nov the gath. fee is .0981.  I'll let you know when I find out about Sept.  Thanks,  Susan 
 I've forwarded your message to Christina Sanchez.  She was the one who reallocated the volumes.  She will look at it again.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Thanks,  Susan

 Terry-  I can drive my Sequoia to practice and take 6 girls to Baskin Robbins as well.  Between you and me, that should be enough space for all the girls.  Susan 
 David-  After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.  Thanks,  Susan 
 Hi, fellow P&Z members.  I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with D= an Muniza of Center America.  Sweet Mesquite restaurant is very interested = in the existing Eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer = when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the = property (where Weiner's is now).  Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in = some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the = City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along = Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  T= he proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.= Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts E= ckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative= fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc. = David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potenti= al liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also,= there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to= be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us = a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the li= ne is in need of replacement anyway.  As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elev= ations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's= reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing= center.  Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the add= itional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the p= arking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be availab= le for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide o= pen after 5 pm.  David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to d= iscuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.  He wanted to do that pri= or to Comp. Plan meeting on the 30th.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira 
 Valerie-  Go with Vintage's numbers on the spreadsheet.  I have corrected the sitara ticket.  I think the problem might have been that I forgot to adjust the fuel value from the previous month.  Sorry for the mistake.  Thanks,  Susan Pereira

 Dear Mr. Jackson-  I am writing to request that the City of West U postpone the proposed work at Colonial Park until at least late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association  practice at the field from February through May every year.  At this late notice, it would be very difficult for WUSA to find a replacement field near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months??  West U prides itself on its focus on community and families; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?  Sincerely,  Susan Pereira 713-349-8836 
 Dear Mr. May-  I am writing to request that West U postpone the planned work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls (ages 6-8) involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in the park from February through May every year.  WUSA would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice, especially anything close to West U.  What harm would it do to delay the City's plans until the summer?  West U prides itself on being a city focused on community and families.  What's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space??  Sincerely,  Susan Pereira 713-349-8836 
 Thanks for your support!  Susan Pereira 
 Dear Ms. Griffin-  I would like to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 neighborhood girls involved in West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park February through May every year.  It will be difficult for WUSA  to find an alternative site on such short notice, especially near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months?  West U prides itself on being family- and community-minded; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?  Sincerely,  Susan Pereira 713-349-8836 
 Dear Mr. Farley-  I am writing to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field at Colonial Park from February through May every year.  If not allowed to use the field, WUSA will have a very difficult time finding a suitable replacement on such short notice, especially near West U.  What harm can it do to postpone the work a couple of months?  West U is a city focused on families and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space??  Sincerely,  Susan Pereira 713-349-8836 
 Mayor Lewis-  I would like to recommend strongly that the City of West University postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  At least 50-60 girls (ages 6-8) in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park from February through May each year.  What harm can it do to postpone the work so that the girls can play there this upcoming season?  If the field is unavailable in 2002, it will be very difficult to find suitable practice sites on such short notice, especially near West U.  West U is all about family and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?  Sincerely,  Susan Pereira 713-349-8836
