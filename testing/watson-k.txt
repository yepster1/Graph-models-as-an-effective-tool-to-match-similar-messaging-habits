ow about moving the meeting to 8:30?  We will have to leave here by 9:35 or so to get a seat at the employee meeting.  Kim.

 FYI, Kim. 
 Lorraine,  Have you had any discussion with SWG regarding their Pataya or Red Lake Storage field?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lee,  Well, I'm not crazy, just dumb not to think about looking at all the emails Denise has sent to me.  This is the original language you drafted for me for the Questar amendment.

We are still on for August 8 for our strategy session between Facility Planning and Marketing.  I believe that HR will be sending out the invite.

 FYI, Kim. 
 Steve,  FYI, Kim. 
 Craig,  Can we get together and talk about this?  I was out of town several days last week, and as I look at it now, I want to make sure I understand the questions that Rita is asking and I'm wondering if we need to do something different with the way that we fill out the deal sheet.  Can you help me comb through this?  I'm in the office all next week.  Just let me know when it is convenient for you.  Thanks, Kim.

 Richard,  These summaries are great!  Our desk is starting to get more of a commercial focus on these imbalances.  May I ask you to put a date on the actual spreadsheet?  As I keep them from week to week, I find that I can't always tell which one is the most current summary.  Many thanks and see you in the next Tues. meeting, Kim.

 Danny has provided us with some tickets to the 2002 Olympic Winter Games Reception celebrating the Olympic Torch Relay in Houston today.  We have VIP Seating and tickets to the VIP Area (although I'm not sure what this means).

John and I will be there and we have tickets for two more interested folks.  Also, the Olympic Torch is being run in front of my home, The Spires, tonight between 5:00 and 5:30pm.  You all are welcome to come over and see this event.  I will try to leave the office around 4:15 to head home.  Please let me know if you would like to come, I will give you directions.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Kevin,  Would you have some time today or tomorrow to discuss this?  Also, we should rally with Kevin Hyatt to discuss his ideas on Sun Devil and determine if we can use a similar strategy for Trans Pecos.  My calendar is pretty open, just let me know what works for you and I'll coordinate with everyone.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I wanted to see if you were interested in going over to High Fashion (Smith@Elgin) during lunch.  I'm looking for some velvet ribbon to tie our flood salvaged ornaments onto our skinny short Christmas tree.  Kim :>) 
 Count me in!  Thanks, Kim. 
 Ramona,  where will this meeting be.  I've asked that Lindy and TK sit in on this.  Thanks, Kim. 
  Sam, I wanted to catch up with you and see how you are doing.  Are you in?  K. 
 Bill,  Here are the changes to the OBA.  Please review.  Also, please look at para 5(c).  Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.  So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.   Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?   Thanks,  Kim. 
 Jan,  Will you be able to attend this meeting today?  I've got a couple of confli= cts in my schedule this afternoon.  Thanks, Kim.

 All,  Joe is able to meet with us at 10:00 Thursday, December 13 in EB1336 to discuss the OBA language as it relates to our ability to enforce dollar value, cash out and other provisions in the OBA with other intra and interstate pipelines.  Please plan to attend.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jean,  Let's book lunch on the 10th.  Let's talk early that morning to confirm time and flavor of food.  I'm looking forward to it!  Thanks, Kim. 
 Danny,  Per your request, if Red Rock was delayed, it would have a $1.1MM impact for June and a $1.6MM impact for July.  Thanks, Kim.

 Paul and Mark,  Please contact Eastern New Mexico (Mark), Enervest (Mark), Citizens (Mark) and Southern Utes (Paul) to make sure they are aware that they are responsible for making the payments on these contracts since ENA has defaulted.  Also, Paul, please confirm again that ENA is not nominating on their own contracts that make up $129,481 of the delinquent payments.  Please keep Steve and I informed of the status.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I'll be there! 
 Kirk,  Thanks for the note.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your family as well.  I look forward to catching up with you in 2002!  Kim. 
 Paula,  Thanks for your note.  I'll give you guys a call around 6:00.  I only need the critical one or two loads and actually, we only need the washing machine since our dryer still works.  Thanks for the kind offer of Chinese, but we've got several gifts to wrap for the office tomorrow so we'd better stay focused.  We truly appreciate your kindness!  Thanks, Kim. 
 Craig,  I'm sorry, I didn't redline this...Please take a look, call me so we can discuss then we can send it back to Tony P. for another review.  Many thanks, Kim.  PS.  We don't want to tender this until they send in a request.  I'm working on that now.

 I wasn't sure you responded to this yet, but we are in Hong Kong the weekend of Feb. 15.  Let's not forget to talk to Valentina (sp?) tonight at JFF.  ILY, K. 
 Bill,  I've made a couple of changes related to ENA having two contracts that we want to market via this method.  Please check my comments and look to see if any of the other language needs to be changed for the additional agreement.  The letter looks great to me.  Thanks for all of your help on this.  Once we hear back from you, we will tender to ENA for their execution so we can proceed forward in selling this capacity.  Thanks, Kim. 
 We are drafting a letter to Sid Rich for their non-payment of $1.6 MM Nov. invoice.  You will find the letter in your email.  TK has water-dropped Sid Rich that a letter is coming this afternoon.  Kim.

 Hey guys (or actually for our current group, girls),  Let's plan on getting together on Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 in EB4180.  The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.  To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) :  Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy. Imbalances on OBA's Analysis of I to I spreads.  -  Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.  Would we have made more money?  Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate? Update Map - coordinate with Darrell, Facility Planning and NNG. West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting. Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil. Pooling. Analysis of our business sold and utilized.  FT, Alt. Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points. (On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information) Weekend on call schedule - update Phones Update - replacement for Jeff's position. Frequency of our staff meeting. Industry Conferences Vacation Schedules   Also, please let me know of additional items that you would like to have discussed in our staff meeting.  I would be happy to include them.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Dan,  Thank you for the great card.  I hope all is well with you.  What are you doing now?  Are you still commuting to California?  Are you working for someone in Houston?  ENE is up today to $0.63.  Gosh, it still feels like we've got the decimal point in the wrong place with our stock.  Just heartbreaking.  Oh well, I'm glad 2002 is here.  This will be a better year for all!  Keep in touch!  Happy New Year to you and your family!  Kim. 
 J,  I don't have a problem committing to Italy and purchasing airfare when it makes $ sense with the thought that we can always cancell just like we did in Sept.  I don't worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith.  I'll keep working Dot to see if she and Tom are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe.  I suspect Janell and Dennis will be no go for anytime in 02.  If Dot and Tom are game then we can talk with D & T and P & J about meeting Jane and Barry to make our party and even 8.  If Dot and Tom are not available to go, I'm more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome.  Have a great day!  ILY, K. 
 Jim,  We would like to call you at 1:30 today to discuss the Sid Rich payment for Nov. business.  Are you available?  We'll call you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Come on down to 13.  We'll be in 1336. 
 Mark,  Will Maria or Dorothy be able to attend and provide their historical knowledge?  I've got it booked on my calendar.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lorraine,  Can you bring Martha's laptop back to the office?  I had originally told her we only needed it while you were out with your sinus surgery.  I'd like to go ahead and return it to her.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Please plan to attend a meeting on Monday, January, 7 from 3:30pm to 4:00pm in EB49C1 to discuss the Trans Pecos Project.  Thanks, Kim. 
 No, I was not aware of this.  Thanks for taking the lead on this, please le= t me know if you need my assistance. =20  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yes, the 1:30 is the prep meeting to the 3:30 Stan meeting.  Danny wants us to look at project financing vs. MLP.  If you get a chance, call me Monday when you get back in the office and we can discuss a little further.  Happy New Year.  Kim. 
 Glen,  Are you familiar with this organization?  Do we normally participate?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Sasha,  Great, sorry, I didn't see the scroll bar.  Thanks!  If you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza's, that would be great.  I believe Morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians, so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections.  I would order plenty for our hearty crowd, someone could always take the leftovers home and eat it for breakfast the next morning!  Also, will the Mad Potter provide the wine, beer and soft drinks?  Is there anything else that you can think of?  Thanks, Kim. 
 TK, FYI, let me know if you think otherwise.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I will check.  We are in 49C1 which is a very large conference room and I'm thinking the phone is off to the side by some side chairs and may not have a long enough cord to stretch to the table.  I will inspect and keep you posted.  Thanks, Kim . 
 Audrey will be in for only a bit this morning.  Please send me bullets by 10:00am.  Thanks, Kim.
