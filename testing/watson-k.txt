ng to keep us (you and me) whole for 2 - 2.5 shopping days in Florence before heading to Rome.  K. 
 Do you have a problem if I call Duke tonight to initiate a 10 year discussion? 
 I talked with Russ.  I told him if he wanted a 5 year, we needed $.26.  We could consider going a little lower if he extended his term to 10 years....I told him we really need $.24 to make it work for 10.  He will run the numbers and call me in the morning.   Kim. 
 Jo, here is the message on the EPNG Marketing Affiliate case. =20  Thanks, Kim. 
 Great, would you reply that we may need up to six chairs, but we will know the exact count within the next week.  Also, ask her about a table cloth to see if we can borrow it.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I will ask Audrey to coordinate our calendars for marketing.  We will let you know.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Hey guys,  We got our first response to a Florence Hotel.  Please read this message and take a look at the attached links to their hotel website to get a feel for the location.  Janell and I think that it is close enough to the city center, but we are open to fresh eyes.  Let me know your thoughts.  I sent about 12 faxes this morning, this is the first to respond.  Janell has personally called about 8 hotels in Florence and they have all been fully booked.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Kim. 
 J, are you interested in this?  K. 
 9:00 works best for me.  I can swirl other stuff for 10:00, I would not be able to do 11:00.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Another response.  I think it is further away than Hotel City?  Can anyone look at a map and tell us?  It's crazy at the office today and I won't have time.  Thanks, Kim. 
 10 yr. deal not looking good.  I have a call into Russ about taking some of the resubscrip space that starts 6/03. 
 FYI, on resubscription space, if we sell 2,000 6/03 and incr.to a total of 7,000 4/04 thru 5/31/07 at $.22, to keep a 15% DCF we have to sell the 43,300 at $.218. 
 Paul,  I think this bounced back to me.  Sorry.  Kim. 
 Darell, this works fine for me.  Where do yo want the Houston folks to go?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey, please review.  It looks OK to me.  Do you have any more suggestions?  Thanks, Kim.
