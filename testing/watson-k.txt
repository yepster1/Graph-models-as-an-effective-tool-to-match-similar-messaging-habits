ent to cooking school.  They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks.  I hope I'm not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe.  My home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098.  Thanks, Kim.   :>) 
 TK,  When you get back from vacation, let's talk about this.  What do I need to do?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I received a message that there will be a surprise lunch for Rich Jolly on Friday, March 29 from 11:30 to 1:00pm in ECN46C1.  Rich is retiring after 35 years of service.  Everyone is invited.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Tiny,  I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.  Good luck on Bisti!  Thanks, Kim. 
 Tiny,  Thanks for the note.  I'll let TK and Mark know that you got the money for the four wheeler.  Along with many, we will miss Rich a lot.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Cindy,  This works fine for me.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  I will plan to attend this meeting.  Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 It may be a good idea for everyone to attend this meeting to get brought up to speed on the 637 filing.  See you there.  Kim. 
 Martha,  I'm sorry you had to miss lunch today.  Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS).  Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains.  He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call.  His office number is 713 739-6715  (if 739 doesn't work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy).  His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct).  Please give him a call.  He is very happy in his new role.  My lunch with him today did remind me of the "good ole days" you and I had with him.  Give me a shout when you get back into the office.   Thanks, Kim   P.S.  We moved up to 39 last weekend.  I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41.  Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk.  (Sorry.......)  Call me. 
 L--- Can you help with this?  Per my conversation with you earlier today.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I was really thinking about the prep work needed for Sat evening.  Can we talk tonight?  What watering hole?  Where?  K. 
 Dear Gary and Fran,  Attached, please find a resignation letter from both me and Lorraine Lindberg.  If you would like a signed hard copy, just let me know, I would be happy to provide it to you.  Lorraine has also indicated that she would provide you a signed hard copy, too.  At your convience, I would like to visit with each of you.  Sincerely,  Kim. 
 Steve, Tiny sent me this note when he heard the news.  K. 
 Hattie,  This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.  Good Luck!  Kim. 
 Sherry,  Thank you so much for your kind thoughts.  I sure have enjoyed working with everyone.  I will miss all the great personalities that we have assembled in ETS!  And, you can definitely count on me for being at The Nutcracker!  Thanks again, Kim  :>) 
 Audrey, here they are.   Thanks, Kim. 
 Shelley,  Congratulations!  TW has a great marketing department and I know that you will enjoy working with everyone.  Can we schedule lunch next week?  I would love to visit with you and share with you some of the things we have been working on to ensure a smooth transition.  I am available on Monday, Wednesday or Friday.  Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Great.  I'll put 11:30 on my calendar.  Kim.

 Thanks, Sue.  Actually, today is my last day in the office.  I will start with KMI (doing Business Development)  in a couple of weeks.  I've got your phone number, I'll call you when I know mine and we'll set something up for later this month.  I hope all is well with Dynegy.  Thanks again,  Kim.

 potiential bullet material.  K. 
 Mark, I reviewed my files and did not find the Dandby section.  I don't believe that I looked in the asset book.  Check with Jim Curry - there did seem to be some confusion about the Asset Listing Summary vs. the Asset Listing Detail (that wasn't in the file)  - maybe it is just miss-filed in their stuff.  Kim. 
 Lindy, I did not see you on this distribution list.  FYI, Kim. 
 Cameron,  I'm glad you found the bulletin board.  The units are in MMBtu/d, the month should be specified by the column.  Thanks,  Kim Watson 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Glen,  Can you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?  Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?  Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?  Many thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 FYI, Lee accepted our invitation to the Nutcracker for Wed. evening.  Kim. 
 Dear Hattie and Jim,  Thank you so much for hosting our dinner group Saturday night.  Your home is just lovely and we particularly enjoyed the beautiful china!  It is so nice to share stimulating conversation and great food with wonderful friends.  Thank you again for your hospitality! See you next week.  Kim and John. 
 Lindy, would you like for me to send Michelle to this meeting?  Should you both go?  Let me know what your preference is.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Steve,  Was Lorraine able to get you an answer before she left?  I know she had a few calls into Nevada Power.  Let me know if you need me to do anything on this in her absence.  Kim. 
 Kevin,  What was the offer price from KMI on the Sonoran Pipeline Project?  Kim. 
 Thank you for the notice.  I would appreciate it if you could mail my prize to my office location in the Enron Building.  I am located in ECN1346.  Thank you very much, I appreciate the effort you guys took to set up this important website.  Kim. 
 Thanks, I will look forward to this!  Kim. 
 Paul,  I'm am sorry that I will not be able to meet you for lunch today.  I have been on the road travelling for the past two weeks and have over 250 emails to catch up on.  I do look forward to catching up with you guys on Sunday.  Good luck at the dentist.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey, here they are.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Here it is.  Kim. 
 I will be there on Monday, 10:30.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Although I've been out of the office a lot, I've been here for time report purposes.  Thanks, Kim.

 I will be there on Monday at 10:30.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Toby,  Please post these ROFR's on the EBB.  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim.

 Lindy,  FYI.  Kim. 
 Sorry, not yet.  Thanks for checking on me.  Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K. 
 If I can't swing Friday, how about planning on being there at 9:00am? 
 Opps, I have my gyn appt on Wed at 2:40 and 3:30.  Can we meet with him on Tues? 
 Dennis,  Thank you for your kind note.  It is amazing how our pets become so much a part of our lives.  John has talked me into going to the cat show which happens to be in town this weekend.  Of course, we will pay special attention to the Turkish Angora breed.  Thanks for your thoughts.  K. 
 I've got it booked.  HAGD, BCDTA, ILY, K. 
 TK,  What are your thoughts on resolving this?  Would it help for you to talk to Pauline?  How can we assist Darrell in this?  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, for the Brian meeting tomorrow.  K. 
 Please keep me posted.  I am off next week, but I would like to book lunch = with you in the next couple of weeks just to catch up.  Twenty-six floors i= s too far away from you guys.  What does your calendar look like.  Throw me= a couple of dates that may work for you.  Thanks, K.=20 
 Lindy,  Just in case you could not see the Word.doc.  K. 
 I will be there.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Jerry,  FYI, Jan and I may be late for this meeting since we are taking her to lunc= h to celebrate her 20 years of service.  If we miss this meeting, may we to= uch base with you by phone to get any pertinent info on TW.  Also, we want = a recap on any stories or jokes that you tell!  :>).  Many thanks,=20 Kim. 
 It is that time of year.... Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November.  Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14.  Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.  As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.  Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.  I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items.    :>)  Thanks, Kim. 
 Mark,  This looks fine.  Kim. 
 Paula, I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.  Thanks, Kim.  P.S.  Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!  I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well! 
 I will be on vacation this day, however, I am planning on coming in for the board meeting in the evening.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jan, FYI, Kim. 
 Hi Phyllis!  I am so excited to get to see you this weekend!  I sure hope all is well with you.  It looks like you and I have been assigned the dinner for Saturday evening.  I am open to ideas for recipes!  Let me know when would be a good time to visit on our assignment.  I will make time for you anytime.  Thanks, Kim.  :>)  phone:  	work 713 853 3098 home 713 791 9201 
 Mary Kay,  What is the usual process on something like this?  Do we get a chance to respond to the protest before the FERC makes a decision on whether to hold a Tech Conf?  What is the timeline for any other protests to come in?  What is the timeline for FERC to decide?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Drew,  If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW t= hen take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible= for the difference? This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity = in different packages of time.   KW. 
 Sorry, I had a typo in your address below. Here is the message.  K. 
 Jerry,=20 Was there anything for TW that came out of this meeting that we need to be = aware of?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I can be available at 6:30 also.  John is on his way back from Austin and I'm not sure of his timing, but I am certainly game.  Let me know where and when you would like for me to meet you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey and Steve,  FYI, I have an eye appointment on Thursday at 4:00pm.  I will leave about 3:30.  I will have my cell phone if anyone needs me.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paula, Can I catch a ride with you?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yes.  I'll be there.  K. 
 Jan,=20 What impact does this change have on our earnings? =20  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 No off-duty time for me on this report.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hey Kevin,  Thanks for the message.  In fact, I talked with Glenn Hass about this earlier today.  I also talked to Questar about this today as well.  Gary Schmitt was somewhat optimistic, but he had not seen the full order yet so he was still reserved.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Michelle,  Would you have time to handle this I/C?  If so, please let Perry know that you are the marketing contact.  If not, please let me know so that I can pass it on to someone else.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paula,  Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for Jim, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.  Some of the names we mentioned last night were:  Bill Tarter Lenore Fenberg Muffin Alfred  Any other names that come to mind?  .....Will Eucker, Art, Tammi Semi, Carolyn Brown, Ken O'Neill... are other people who have been involved in various efforts.  Your thoughts?  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI....  I believe Dave N. and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. I've got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, James has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow. The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations? We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lindy, FYI, I have a call into Tiny to discuss this picture and the ownership of the pipe in question.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Thanks for setting this meeting up.  K. 
 Audrey, here they are.... 
 FYI. K. 
 Lindy, thanks for looking into this.  I agree with your comments.  Kim. 
 Hi Dot.  Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see what she says.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.
