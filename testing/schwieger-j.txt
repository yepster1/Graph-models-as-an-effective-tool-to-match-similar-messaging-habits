nds to me like someone knew what was going on to me? I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest" 
 Sorry, I missed your call. I was to busy being sarcastic about ENE!  How about 6:00 PM. I can go for a run beforehand. I picked the time so you have to pick the place.

 Chris:  Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from s= omeone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a met= hod that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is tha= t the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from sto= rage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percent= age was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.= We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the= Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would = try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures= for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refill= ing, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining invento= ry.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu fa= ctor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected = as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints = This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increase= s your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I wou= ld appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is u= sed and how it is put in the model.  =09Jim 
 Greg:  A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response: 1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity. 2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation? 3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?  Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!  Thanks, Jim 
 If the MMBtu enhancement is this high, have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept (exceed pipeline spec's).  Will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content? 
 Thought  you might enjoy!  How was your day?  ENE just cant seem to stay up.  Two down days in a row!  I have Jarrod tonight since Joan & Dave are out of town.  Might try and go play poker if Josh will watch Jarrod for me.  Have a good evening! Swig 
 FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
 Greg: Thanks for the quick and candid response.  I appreciate it!  Jim 
 I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.  I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha

 John:  Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss= ions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value o= f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution= .  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t= ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str= uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations = of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o= f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr= on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde= d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h= ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa= irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan= so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s= olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny = an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un= der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of = the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!
