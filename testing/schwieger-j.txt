hanks for the quick and candid response.  I appreciate it!  Jim 
 I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.  I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha 
 Thought you might enjoy! 
 John:  Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss= ions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value o= f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution= .  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t= ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str= uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations = of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o= f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr= on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde= d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h= ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa= irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan= so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s= olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny = an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un= der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of = the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

 I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions. 1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses. VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION 3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit. The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit. (For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.) This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.  Thanks,  Jim

 As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts. 
 This assumes 65 bcf or approximately 67 tbtu of pad gas.  According to this mornings Operations Reprt there is 88.3 bcf in the cavern.  This includes Third Party Storage volumes of approximately 3.4 tbtu.  Let me know if this is not what you werer asking.  Jim

 Yes, all withdrawals for Centana should be in the same month (May).  If we don't have a deal ticket for the additional April injections Kenny please prepare one for my signature.  Thanks,  Jim 
 As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter. 
 Ted:  Please respond to Brian's question on when the Ad Val Tax is paid.  Please "cc" me on your answer also.  Thanks,  Jim

 Hi There!  Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.  Im looking forward to Friday night! Don't forget your number for roulette.  Jim

 Hi guys:  I want you both to know that you should be totally embarrassed that the 48 year old fat guy found the web site on his own when you two could not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The web site is:  www.boat-ed.com/tx/ Ben get on it right away so that you can ride the wave runners by yourself! Its going to be fun. Congratulations on passing all of your classes.  See you in a couple of weeks!  Swig 
 Thanks! 
 How are you today? Things are OK down here! Nothing really new since last night!  NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat. That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month! Its the little things that count, right!  They continue to hate ENE! It really makes me wonder?  Be Safe! Swig 
 How are you today? The ball game last night was a disaster! We give the "Bad News Bears" a bad name. Example:  Runners on 1st and 2nd. I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.  He replies touch third base.  So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.  I give up!  We lost 20 to 3  On a worse note.  Please don't say anything to anybody but Pat just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce. I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.  She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.  He has done nothing but foster this attitude.  Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse. I will let you know what comes of things.  Why can't everything just work out instead of all this turmoil.  I hate all of this shit!  It hurts!  Love Jim 
 thought you might enjoy this!  Love, Swig 
 I slept good also! Today is supposed to be close to 90, but then the front moves through and Thursday is supposed to be 74 I would like to do the half marathon with you but unless I have allot more free time I don not think I can get into a shape that I could run that far! I'm really fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm getting pressure or inferences that if I do not drop things my bonus might not be there! Saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter! They really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance! It does get me down because I'm not sure mankind is worth it! If people you thought had standards, ethics and morals are now applying pressure, whets the use?  Sorry, to be complaining! Talk to you later!  Swig 
 Thanks,  Boy I'm disappointed in the questions asked by other employee's! Maybe the Employees deserve what they get?  Sounds like Parris was quick but fun. Glad it was you and not me on the plane for 17 hours.  Be good and stay safe Swig 
 Sorry about not returning your call this morning! I was trying to finish my questions for the All Employee meeting! Like it made any difference! They would not address any of my questions. What made it worst is I can not believe how STUPID the general Enron employee population is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the midst of the worst company crisis ever, when they have a chance to ask important questions, they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind! I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten!!! I'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone!  Except you of course!  lets talk tonight. Jarrod has a 6:00 pm ball game, but I do not think we are going!  Thanks, for calling! Swig 
 I really wish you would not feel that way or make an apology.  I do not consider what you expressed Friday night was anything other than honesty and true emotion and I would like to feel comfortable expressing those same feelings to you!  I trust you and respect your opinion to great extent because of the above.  If I can help its yours!  Smile and take a deep breath! I believe their is a reason for everything! Let me know if their is anything you want me to express at the "All Employee Mtg"  Swig
