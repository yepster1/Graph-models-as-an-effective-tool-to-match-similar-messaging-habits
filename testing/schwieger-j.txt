 Linda called and said that they do not have enough vacation days left in 2001, so they would like to use one of the later packages in 2002. They asked how late in 2002 they could possibly go and I said I would have to ask you what's available. Give me a call when you get a chance. This is what I could not remember the other day when we talked.  See Ya,

 I'm in a really sour mood. I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time! I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep. It's the "pits" I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself. I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things. My excuse is that I'm always exhausted I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this. I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!  ENE is down $1.42 right now! No news that I know of? The DOW is down (113) right now. It appears that things may be escalating in Afghanistan. I think the Special Forces are close.  Have fun at Jackson Hole! Miss Ya! Swig  Sorry this is so late.  I actually forgot to send it this morning???????????????????????/
