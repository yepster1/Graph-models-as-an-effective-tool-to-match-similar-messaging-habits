ince your visit.  I'll talk to you soon.  Tell Marie we said hi.  Kevin 
 Angela,  I'm not looking for another rotation.  I will be staying in NG trading and will hopefully be getting promoted this PRC session.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Kevin 
 Thanks for the gift certificate. You shouldn't have done that.  I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow for 5 days.  I'll talk to you when I get back.  Kevin 
 Let's shoot for 6:30am on Friday.  I should be able to meet for about 15 minutes.  Let me know if this works for you.  Kevin 
 Your boy Gore is a nut.  How's everything going?  Looking forward to seeing you Gloria and Tommy over Christmas.  Take Care,  Kevin  - West_Palm_Beach_voters..doc 
 Sounds great.  Let me know what your schedule is like.  Kevin 
 Please send me a few recommended B&Bs and restaurants.  Thanks for your help.  Kevin  My email at home is kruscitti@aol.com (I think). 
 Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his phone number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 18049 Torrence Ave Lansing, IL  60438  Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was referred by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from Bill.  He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of cut, clarity, color, and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and describe them over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to be very competitive.  Let me know how it goes.  Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 Thanks.  Is there something I could do to facilitate the process.  KR 
 Any word.  I've been waiting for a while on this issue.  Kevin 
 Thanks for the update.  Let me know when everything is a go. 
 You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so poorly.  I often look back with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, not to mention his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be compared to x-Philly and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or not Ivan will elect to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.  On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May. It's a fixer-upper. All our weekends are spent working on it.  I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going in your world.  Tell Rina and the kids we said hi.  Kevin 
 I forgot, we have a new telephone # (713) 880-4157.  I'll pick you up on Thursday and I'll take Friday off.  Looking forward to seeing you.  KR 
 Thank you.  Kevin 
 Rebecca,  I am no longer in the A/A program.  I got promoted this past review period. Please let me know if you got the update or not.  Thanks,  Kevin x3-6320 
 I have no additional info.  I was waiting to hear back from you.  I'll give them a call.  Kevin 
 Unfortunately there're not.  I already checked. 
 Thanks 
 Everything is correct except from my location - 3234B. Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 I'll be in town all weekend.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Anything in particular you want to do in the Lone Star State.  KR 
 F.P.,  Do you have your schedule yet?  Let me know as soon as you can.  I need to schedule a trip with work and I'll schedule it around your visit.  Looking forward to seeing you.  KR 
 Still waiting to hear back about your possible visit.  Any word?  Kevin 
 Did you pull the trigger? 
 Debra,  Could you call me when we're set to trade w/ Cinnabar?  Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.  Kevin x3-6320 
 That would be great.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 T.J.  Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just like Rena, huh?  As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller does though. Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.  Kevin 
 We will be in town.  It would be great to see you and Marie.  Sorry for the delayed response, I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make it out.  I'll check into some things to do.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 We should be in town that week.  I'll make sure we save the date.  Kevin 
 Kelly,  I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 firms and he didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything changes, let me know. It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the Astros are in town that weekend. I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear everything's going well.  I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore me as usual.  Talk to you soon.  KR  P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some serious work.  Hopefully it'll be habitable by the time you see it. 
 Chump,  Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you. Between work, the wedding, and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been pretty stressed. As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down considerably.  We're only going to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that includes you of course, Moller, Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her though, she's the only one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to share a room.  I feel kinda bad about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like dealing with Kim.  She's really annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.  We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a catered dinner for about 45 folks. It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.  Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched you'll be a lot closer.  You could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we should have it in decent shape. We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs a lot of work.  We'll be busy for the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.  Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'll be back.  Take care and tell Marie we said hi.  Kevin 
 We'd love to go to the opener.  Let's talk Monday.  I don't know if I'll be able to get downstairs by 11:00am, so let's work something out.  Kevin 
 Kevin Ruscitti  Gas Trading (Central)  Hunter Shively  Long Term Origination, Power Structuring  May 5, 1998  Gas Trading is my final rotation.  This is my permanent position.  If you have any questions, call me at X3-8530.  Thanks, Kevin Ruscitti 
 Congrats Murli,  Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job at Enron. I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the Communications group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would be better at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 (W) and we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate brokers to refer you to.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 713-853-6320 (W) 713-830-0671 (H) 
 Could you please extend the guest id that expired for FTEnergy, the publisher of gas daily.  Please call me when this is completed.  We need to have these folks view our daily indices.  Thanks,  Kevin Ruscitti x3-6320 
 Dave,  It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you enjoyed dinner.  Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I have a quick question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if Mar is currently higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what happens if you withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How is this accounted for?  I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.  Kevin 
 I hope that didn't surprise you.  You notice that our avg GMATs are stronger than Harvards. 
 Congratulations!!  I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, huh? Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why didn't get back to you.  I'll try you today.  Kevin  P.S.  Great Name 
 You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite some time now.  How's everything in SF?  Have you moved into your new office?  KR 
 Leroy,  Thanks for the email.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually am just catching up with my emails now - Friday at 5pm.  I'm interested in talking to you about the lunch discussion.  Kevin 3-6320 
 Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys. I hope it comes across OK.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin   - DCP00617.BMP 
 Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is working for Johnson Controls. It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for about 5 months.  I love my new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and Michigan.  Things have been incredibly busy.  The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger, frustration and stress.  How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears games?  The Scarlet Knights have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.  Let's talk soon.  Kevin 
 Anne Marie,  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the 11th. Keep me in mind for next time though.  Kevin 
 Murli,  Great to hear from you.  I'm glad you accepted the offer - I'm sure you'll enjoy you're experience at Enron.  Good luck during your final semester.  Kevin 
 Dan,  Please take a look at the new Purchase agreement and let me know what you think.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 That is if you ever get you LLC set up.  Look forward to trading with you in 2001.  KR 
 Joke, huh? 
 Davis,  Let me know if this helps.  kevin 
 If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis differentials as well. Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying to do.  Kevin x3-6320 
 I received the email.  Thanks,  kevin 
 Dude,  What's your work #.  I need to give you a call.  Kevin 
 T.J.,  I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it. How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the holidays or staying in LA?  Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 You too.  Make sure you tell Paul I said Hi.  Kevin
