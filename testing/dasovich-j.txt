million in alleged inflated earnings. ?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the state's troubles. ?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium. ?????"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time," said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. "We helped keep the lights on in California." ?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a "rainy day" account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. ?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market, where emergency purchases are made. ?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them from falling. ?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy market. ?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. "The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions." ?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings "outrageous," insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. ?????"These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state," Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state. ?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce. ?????"We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%," he said. "It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats." ?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never took it personally. "If you're innocent," he said, "you don't look at the criminal file." ?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. ?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits. ?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon recovery program. ?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. ?????"From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we operated precisely within the terms of their rules," Oliver said. ?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act responsibly, has bailed out. ?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, the highest. ?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers offering power received the highest price paid in any hour. ?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to sell at a single-digit price. ?????"They weren't the culprits," said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. "Someone else drove that up." ?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. ?????"We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw," he said. ?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because the overall prices are still excessive. ?????"We're saying the patient is sick," Sheffrin said of California's electricity market. "It needs help [and] may die." ?????

 Unless someone has concerns, I'd like to share the results of our Wednesday meeting w/Roger. 
 FYI. 
 As of right now, I'm available, but with the crisis in California, I might be called away.  At this point, though, I'm clear and will plan on meeting.  My apologies for the uncertainty.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the note.  We'll need to to discuss this a bit further, since it could be a very sensitive issue for us (e.g., "Enron's answer to the electricity crisis in municipalization).  If spun right, could provide an interesting opportunity, however.  Best, Jeff    Robert Davis/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange 05/04/2001 04:08 PM

 You're welcome, but no need for thanks.  I was just telling it like it is. You do a great job for us, and we appreciate it a lot.  I'm going to be up on there on Monday.  I'm going to need for you to get me up to speed a little bit on the gas bills.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 decided i ought to ask around first..... 
 Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue Book).  He was following up from the meeting this morning with Bob Glynn.  He was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to Glynn at this morning's meeting.  He was particularly positive about the core/noncore proposal.  He asked to meet to discuss it further.  I have an appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.  He offered--as a board member of the California Chamber of Commerce--to help bring the Chamber along, and he also said that he can help with the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Ass. I'll report back after the meeting.  And may have already mentioned that I have a meeting scheduled in Sacramento Monday with the CEO of the Chamber and the President of CMA.  Will report back on the meetings.  Have a good weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi folks: Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.  Worse, some nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time) deleted my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed up)---year's worth of work and school gone, kaputt.  Anyway, if there's any chance that someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me, I would be greatly indebted.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and see you on Monday.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings Laura and Marybeth:  Laura: If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour briefing you on the energy situation.  I apologize for the brevity of this note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.  In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of center).  The deal would be bi-partisan.  If successful, the deal would:  Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right price signals for efficiency, but fall short of "shock therapy." Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates. Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the solution Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate changes. Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market. NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal). Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers. Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc.  Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of "wise persons" to help get the deal done.  L. Summers is willing; others are being considered.  Your name has come up.  But that issue can be addressed later. The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events, which are breaking quickly.  Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.  Congratulations on Haas' #7 ranking in US News and World Report.  Best, Jeff  Office 415.782.7822 Pager 888.916.7184 Home 415.621.8317 Cell 415.505.6633

 Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up doing more work on my property.

 Greetings:  Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California Chamber of Commerce.  Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.  Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read "grow up") and do a comprehensive deal.  Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.  We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support and pitch:  1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve this now, and 2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've described.  They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly didn't reject the idea.  Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm serious.  Are you referring to the proposal that no one knows about that everyone knows about?  We going to celebrate?    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/08/2001 06:27 PM 
 Marybeth:  My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter returning to Houston.  Likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow, if that works with Laura.  I'll check Steve's schedule and forward the information to you.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 05/08/2001 07:44 PM

 FYI. Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).  This is the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.  Will check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes were made.  Best, Jeff 
 Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea (lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:  They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut. McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore ("why should it be mandatory to go the market?"), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for core/noncore has a lot of merit. Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) should pay for DWR's "past" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates the core's "net short" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would not have to pay for any of DWR's "going forward costs" (since core gets them, in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation) I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects would be and would share it with them when we're done. While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do. They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the Legislature. Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to CMA. Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved. 
 My apologies.  I took a vacation that I was in much need of, and as you know, it's more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the day-to-day mess.  And I came back to utter chaos.  Regarding my homework assignment, I checked my records and, lo and behold, I am completely vested.  That said, I also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to make leaving a compelling proposition.  Of course, it goes without saying that working with you is about as compelling as it gets, but when I stack up the other pieces of the puzzle, they seem somewhat less compelling than the opportunity to work with you.  It is so enticing.  But it is with extreme regret that I am inclined to decline your gracious offer.  Would be happy to discuss it further, and you know without me saying that I am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative.  Give a holler when you find a minute.  Best, Jeff

 This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.  Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a summary that we could provide him.

 Marybeth:  I apologize. As I mentioned, this situation is extremely fluid.  I also mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the Governor, it was agreed that the meetings would continue, every day, until the thing got resolved.  I was just informed that I've been elected by my management to be on today's call (Steve Kean and I will be our representatives).  It starts at 1PM.  We are scheduled to talk at 2:30 PM.  I'm hoping--but not altogether hopeful---that the call will end before 2:30.  I can't apologize enough for the scheduling problems, particularly since I'm the one who originated the request to chat with Laura.  We can do it one of several ways; it's completely your call:  1) play it by ear, and I can let you know around 2:15 if I think the call's going to wrap up by 2:30.  2) we can reschedule (I would of course very much like to brief Laura on what's going on). 3) you can decide it's too much trouble and throw up your hands, which I would understand.  Let me know how you 'd like to proceed and please give my sincere apologies (and best) to Laura.  I have to get on the call right now, so if you need to speak to a live person, give Joseph a call at 415.782.7841.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Alan:  In our ongoing analysis of the MOU, and in our attempt to put together a solution for California, we need to do a reality check on the implied curves the Governor's consultants are using to arrive at their rate proposals.  To ensure an "apples to apples" comparison, we're hoping to get our curve data for 24X7 power, averaged on a quarterly basis, from 2001-2010.  Hoping that you can get that for us.  That possible?  Let me know.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 1) if he's got 30 minutes, then he should join for 30 minutes. 2) quite urgent, since the analysis needs to be done pronto. 3) if he can't join, that's ok.  we can fill him after the meeting.    Joseph Alamo 05/10/2001 03:11 PM

 Marybeth: The call's ended and I'll be available for the 2:30 call.  Best, Jeff 
 Good job.  It's got traction.  Can you call when you get a chance to regroup.  thx, jeff 
 OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is the analysis that you're already working on:  Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03. Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 years). Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the short for the core) Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.  Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Maureen:  Could you ask Steve if he will be able to make the 4:30 (CST) with Laura Tyson?  I think you 've got the call-in number. Tell him it's not big deal if he can't--I can handle--but if he can, it might be useful for him to be on the line.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff

 The world is mighty small.  As an undergrad at Berkeley, I worked as a paralegal at Brobeck.  One of the "associates" I reported to was, you guessed it, Gary Fergus. Haven't seen him since.  Will be interested to compare notes.    MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> 09/29/2000 06:26 PM

 This looks fantastic.  I apologize profusely. I've got a dozen assigments to finish by COB.  But having read this, you obviously needed no help from me. Let me know how the call with Riordan goes.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 05/11/2001 02:16 PM 
 Got message re: letter from Sherman to OPIC.  I'm in all day Monday. Best, Jeff 
 Hi Maureen: Could you please make sure that Steve gets these? Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Michael:  did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers?  I would worry about that (particularly since we use the MOU QF/IOU gen numbers).  I suggest that we use the MOU load numbers for the three utilities, since the PUC numbers seem real screwy e.g., they have PG&E's load being smaller than Edison.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI, another arrow in our quiver:  ? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed California that "the only way the state will improve its credit rating and look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the undercollected." 
 Yes, please submit my name.  Thanks a bunch.  I'll be talking about everything.    MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 05/11/2001 04:50 PM 
 I am swamped.  Please call me from your car when you start driving to the= =20 City (preferably when you're close to the City so that I can get some more = of=20 this work done). 
 Bibi's the man---he's the guy I mentioned when we discussed the other night. 
 Hi:  O lord.  You know, the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have time to think about things and absorb it.  But work has gotten so insane that I sympathize with your plight (since mine's the same).  I think I've maybe made it to 1/2--that's 1/2--of the finance classes.  NORTH of Sacramento.  Are you driving to Sacramento every day?  Say it ain't so.  That's brutal.  When you say full time, you mean school full time?  That, I assume, means leaving your job?  Be happy to talk about it.  You know me---believer in always keeping all options open and active.  If full time makes sense, you ought to do it.  Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'll be missing class (again) on Tuesday because I have to be in Portland.  If you're not going to Sac on Monday, coffee in SF during work hours works.  Or I could meet you during break on Monday.  Or we could have lunch or a beer after work on Thursday or Friday when I'm back from Portland.  Hang in there.  I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground again.  Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.  Let me know what works for you.  Best, Jeff  PS  I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case. Hope that's modest consolation.  "Strategizing?!"   (I don't think so.)    Courtney Abernathy <courtney_abernathy@yahoo.com> 09/30/2000 07:52 PM 
 can we use the MOU total load numbes (e.g., 93 GWH for PG&E) and divide it up using the proportions in the PG&E numbers? 
 Greetings Piper:  My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.  I think you've spoken with Karen Denne.  Scott asked for some background materials on our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.  I'll be forwarding those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.  Does that work for you?  Best, Jeff Dasovich Enron Corp 415.782.7822 
 agreed.    Michael Tribolet/ENRON@enronXgate 05/11/2001 05:33 PM 
 Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.  Said she'd heard that Ken Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron buying Edison's transmission system.  I told her that Enron is not in the market for transmission systems.  Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the nukes.  Best, Jeff 
 Amen.    Mark Palmer 05/11/2001 06:36 PM 
 Please, please keep Dave out of it.  Note to follow.    Karen Denne 05/11/2001 07:02 PM 
 It'll be to you in about 10-15 minutes. 
 Attached is additional background on the solution that Ken Lay discussed today and that Enron is proposing as a comprehensive solution to California's electricity crisis.  If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822 or on my pager at 888.916.7184.  Best regards, Jeff 
 chk vmail when you get a chance. best,jeff 
 Thanks.  That certainly puts things in perspective. 
 You're much too kind.  Thanks for the feedback.  My brains just about spilled out end of the day Friday.  Spent the weekend in a haze.  Best, Jeff 
 coincidentally i did see governor backbone on the show.  i don't think that we can count on him toning it down anytime soon, which will not be helpful in getting a solution out here.  best, Jeff

 I saw "the event" re-reun on local cable access TV (randomly viewed on Saturday).  It was not pretty and Jeanne did a great job of remaining calm and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence!  Unfortunately, I wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers, but a large bouquet is certainly in order.  Best, Jeff    Leslie Lawner 05/14/2001 10:17 AM

 Hi Piper: The email I sent on Friday to Scott McNealy's address (listed below) got bounced back to me.  Just wanted to make sure that you folks received the materials.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East. As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try to advance the ball.  I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Hello Sarah: My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I work for Enron in Enron's San Francisco office. Last Friday, the Chairman of our company, Ken Lay, met with Kevin Sharer and other CEOs from California to discuss the energy crisis in California and the need to develop as soon as possible a comprehensive solution to the problem. Mr. Sharer asked for some additional background on the issues and the solution and asked that you be contact person.  That information is attached. If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822 or on my pager at 888.916.7184.

 Thank.  Talk to you then.  Best, Jeff    Kortney Brown/ENRON@enronXgate 05/14/2001 03:00 PM 
 Your call.  Let us know what we can do to help.  Best, Jeff 
 Simon did a nice job on the presentation, but I need some things re-arranged, added, etc.  Should I call him directly, other?  Let me know.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 you getting pages in Tokyo?  jeff 
 thx for call.  no about plan "B" but haven't seen anything on paper.  jeff 
 s. govenar is faxing me a copy.  thx very much for the info.  jeff 
 Man, you rule!  Good job.  I'll give you a call. 
 Thanks.  Will be very interested to hear how the meeting goes.  My sense is that the timing could be just about right. Best, Jeff    Hedy Govenar <hgovenar@govadv.com> 05/14/2001 05:51 PM 
 I can make either time.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Scott Reblitz@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/14/2001 05:48 PM 
 It was a beautiful day (and evening).  Congratulations to you both.  It is a very sweet thing for two very sweet people, and I'm sort of choked up for being asked to be in the wedding party.  It was a great day for everybody. Congratulations.  Best, Jeff  Beware, the mighty reefer.... 
 Maureen:  Few things.  I was on the call with Steve today and he asked me to do a couple of things.  1) Send a summary of today's call to the email list that you've put together.  I've got the list from the note you forwarded to me with the call-in info for today's call.  Is that the complete list?  If not, could you foward me the most recent one, which I'll use to distribute the summary?  2) Could you set up another call for this Friday (May 18th) for 60 minutes at 10 CDT/8 AM PDT, and distribute to the same bunch of folks that were on today's call?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Best, Jeff 
 Plz call.  Any numbers yet?  Skilling talking to Gov today?   415.782.7822. 
 Got a message from PG&E.  Open season will be for 2003 and beyond and they'll be accepting bids up to 30 years.  Will talk to PG&E and get back with more information.  If you having any questions give a holler at 415.782.7822.  Best, JEff 
 FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail that wags the dog.  P.S.  I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.  Looks like about $75K for three months.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/14/2001 08:07 PM 
 Great suggestions.  Thanks so much for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.  Best, Jeff  SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.  The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) 
 FYI. 
 I can do tomorrow. 
 Thanks a million.  FYI, I meant to send you a "thank you" note in response to the note with Friday call-in info, but it went to Steve instead.  Best, Jeff    Maureen McVicker 05/15/2001 09:30 AM 
 Rick/Paul:  Message(s) received loud and clear.  I'll await Paul's email and proceed according to that plan.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 10:44 AM 
 FYI. 
 Wow.  Don't worry about it.  Have a great time in Montana.  It will be gorgeous up there.  You're camped out in Roseville?  You don't deserve that, Courtney.  Good idea to find out when the deadlines are.  When you get back, give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or something.  Considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea and the right thing to do.  Don't stress too much.  Good luck and can't wait to hear about Big Sky.  Best, Jeff    Courtney Abernathy <courtney_abernathy@yahoo.com> 10/01/2000 09:56 PM 
 Enron will very vigorously support the CS and I would hope that we could get as many people as possible to do the same.  Let's face it, California's gas industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess (despite, and perhaps contrary to, the substantially more narrow reasoning offered by the Brattle Group).  The CS is a well-thought-out, well-designed program for moving forward; unlike the "interim," which takes two steps back.  Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call them and try to get them to show up in support?  Best, Jeff    Tom Beach <tomb@crossborderenergy.com> 05/14/2001 11:37 PM 
 How's this look?  Steve Kean Rick Shapiro (GA) Paul Kaufman (GA) Vicki Sharpe (EES) Mike D. Smith (EES) Chris Calger (ENA) Karen Denne (PA) 
 Thanks.  I'll get you one more name then.  FYI:  To use a Kaufman phrase, "I'm a little frosted."  I'm on a litigation call, on which I mentioned the Plan B (which I got only because I searched out Scott Governor yesterday).  On the call Sandi said, "Jeff, there's a response from the Governor to the Plan B, which I faxed to Steffes yesterday."  I want you to know that I took a deep breath, and asked Sandi to fax it to the San Francisco office.  Unreal....  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 11:38 AM 
 Thanks Robert: One caution.  It's important that the first-cut analysis be "simple" and uses, to the maximum extent possible, the MOU numbers and modeling.  This allows us to explain a complex situation to people who aren't necessarily "numbers oriented" and to do so with an "apples-to-apples"  comparison. That's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's important to have, at the outset, the cleanest, simplest version of "here's what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model."  That said, I understand that even with the simple base case, some tweeks are likely.   Talk to you in an hour.  Thanks again for the help.  Best, Jeff     Robert Neustaedter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/15/2001 11:24 AM 
 I am on back to back conference calls.  What would you like me to do to help get materials prepared for Ken Lay?  I'm available at about 11:45 AM my time if you'd like to try to talk then.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 What are the details for tomorrow? 
 Looks complete to me.  No comments.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 11:30 AM 
 sorry to bother you with this, but could you please fax me the governor's response to plan B?  thx, jeff

 You going to brief me tonite on tomorrow's meeting? 
 You did an absolutely fabulous job on Sunday.  It was a great time, the food was extraordinary, and the wine was better still.  Thanks so much for it all.  You're very sweet.  Almost makes any more engagements superfluous, don't you think.  (kidding!)  Don't forget to water the tomatoes!  Best, Jeff    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/15/2001 11:27 AM 
 Thanks for the commnets, Lynn.  I've faxed you a copy of "Plan B."  I'll let others chime in, but ideally it seemsthat we'd want to start the meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed, comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion.  But at a minimum we'd want to get "the process" nailed down by very early next week.  Best, Jeff     Lynn.A.Lednicky@dynegy.com 05/15/2001 07:34 AM 
 will do.  Thanks. 
 Thanks very much.    Joseph Alamo 05/15/2001 05:24 PM

 "Plan B" As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that has been working on a "Plan B." They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's MOU with Edison. The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU. First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis may be emerging. Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to require a lot more work to get right. Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable. On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it to the Legislature to take the lead role. The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter. Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of the discount that suppliers would be willing to take. The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable. The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the process of negotiations underway. Next Steps If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet separately to discuss next steps. Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies. Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."  Sandi mentioned that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor hired to advise him on the crisis. If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll get it to you.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem.  We will fax it to you.  Best, Jeff    "Edmonds, Sonnet" <sonnet.edmonds@mirant.com> 05/15/2001 02:43 PM

 Greetings.  Will there be a call-in number?  Best, Jeff 
 never mind.  I actually bothered to read the ENTIRE note and answered by own question.  Apologies.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry, but thanks. 
 Here's the edited version (word document format).  If you have any questions, just give me a ring at 415.782.7822.  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff

 I'll be here. 
 Very nice touch; particularly the opening paragraph.  You do good memos. Should one expect any fireworks?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Maureen:  Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.  The letter 1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key components of a comprehensive solution.  Could you please get a copy of the letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken Lay?    Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll buckle up.  P.S. 1Scott faxed you a letter from Cox and Brulte to Hertzberg and Burton. Check  it out.  It's a pretty darned smart letter:  1) very cooperative 2) substantively attractive and rational.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry I had to get off the call early.  Hope it helped.  If there's anything else you need, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 yep.  it's on its way. 
 aye aye.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/16/2001 10:06 AM 
 FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go figure.  Best, Jeff 
 Ok, cut the shakespeare.  What's your vote?  She wrote again in inquiring. 
 Thank you for the feedback.  We're "sanitizing" the document a wee bit (taking out the "opposing view--response" part).  When that's done, I assume it will OK to distribute.  Karen?  Best, Jeff    Susan M Landwehr 05/15/2001 11:12 PM 
 I'm trying to meet a deadline at the moment, but are you free this afternoon?  I have some information that can help a lot in that analysis.  Best, Jeff    Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 12:19 PM 
 I'll give you a call then.    Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 12:26 PM 
 Few changes made.  Here it is.  Best, Jeff 
 The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that old wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).  Possible for you guys to come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on Thursday.  I'm going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul it away.  If Cameron has to work are you available?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll do it, babe. 
 Apologies.  Can we make it 4?    Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 12:26 PM 
 sounds good.    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 05/16/2001 02:18 PM 
 got message.  thanks. will talk to michael tribolet.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks.  talk to you then. 
 Hi Christine:  Yes, forwarded the email you sent last week.  Here's where folks came out. First, we think that the folks in your first group are mean.  Second, it's a real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will break the camel's back.  Suggestion came up that it might be much more mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first.  If there's a problem finding a smaller group, then we could try to do five and hope the ship don't sink?  Sound reasonable?  Best, Jeff    Christine Piesco <christine.piesco@oracle.com> 10/02/2000 01:14 PM 
 Duly noted on the email address.  Look forward to seeing you when you in California.  Best, Jeff    Stephanie Miller/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 02:15 PM

 Thanks.  Good luck. 
 That clears it up.  Thanks very much for the prompt response. 
 The dinner was incredibly delicious.  Thank you very much.  I apologize for being so late--increasingly I have less and less control over my schedule. Would have much preferred to have spent it with you guys.  And sorry that I pooped out so early---I'm running on zero sleep and had a 7:30 conference call this morning.  That said, the dinner was really extraordinary.  You guys outdid yourself. Made an others tough day very nice.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 u see letter from barry goode to u re: lawsuits NOT on table?  jeff 
 PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado. It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines. The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord. The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31. Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03. Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want). Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103. About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed "Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02). As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03). PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date. In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date. The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado. How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing. No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).  Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.  Best, Jeff 
 it was really good.  how'd you cut up those damned potatoes like that?    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 05/18/2001 12:16 PM

 Karen: Great job.  Here are my edits.  Best, Jeff 
 I have to go to Portland tomorrow, coming back Wednesday afternoon. I'd like to see you tonite before I leave if you're available. 
 Michael Tribolet and I (about 99% Michael) have put together a rough cut analysis of the core/noncore structure, and some scenarios Hertzberg has asked for.  Hertzberg's expecting some info from us on Monday (and I'm sure that he'll want more scenarios, too).  Are you available first thing Monday morning to be briefed on the analysis, my conversations with Hertzberg, what Hertzberg's strategy is, etc.? 
 Can you talk early Monday AM w/me & Tribolet re: core/noncore analysis for Hertzberg?  Jeff 
 Thank you.  I will participate in the call.   Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Can you join? 
 need to chk w/Tribolet, but does 9:30 AM CDT on Monday work for you?  jeff 
 Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the issue......  Davis announces four new energy advisors   Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m. Gov. Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team.  Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new director of communications.  Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months.  Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal regulators and with generators.  Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.  Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers, Maviglio said.  -- Associated Press 
 No word from Steve.  Ken thought the meetings were very worthwhile, though he was pooped by the time he got to the airport.  We laughed (cried?) about Riordan during the car ride.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 05/18/2001 06:58 PM 
 8:30 AM PDT, every monday.  call-in = 800.998.2462  code = 4912753  be great if you could join regularly.  Best, Jeff 
 Nice job.  Only comment is that the crazies in California now find market power under every rock and in every pipeline.  I think there's a chance that someone might assert that 20% share equals market power.  Might want to say "significant supplier" or something similar.  No big deal, but I thought I'd flag it for your consideration.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes.    Jennifer Thome 05/21/2001 10:03 AM 
 On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to try to resolve it.  Attached are:  A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last week A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more detailed "backgrounder."  If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Seem like it's up to Cameron.  In the past, she's said that she doesn't like her B-Day to be included in the weekends' festivities.  I'm happy to celebrate then, though?  And happy to do anything else that anyone wants to do to celebrate.  Signed, Ooooolllll' Easy Goin'    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/21/2001 09:58 AM 
 You guys are stars.  Thanks so much for all you did for Prentice.  I think she had a really, really good time and felt really neat about the whole thing.  She's wonderful and you guys gave her the wonderful day that she earned and deserved.  Thanks so much.  And, as usual, thanks for being great hosts yesterday (Nancy, you outdid yourself with dinner).  OK, so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday night.  If you guys want, we can pack up the Suburban with everything that needs to go up ( or at least just about everything), and we can drive it up and then you two can take my SAAB up.  Then, coming back, you can drive the Suburban and I can drive the SAAB.  What do you think?  Finally, Eldon, do you have the Blue Book at your house?  I'm looking for the number of someone I can get to haul away all the crap (junk from around the generator shed, that rotten ol' pile of wood by the driveway, the un-salvagable wood from the old deck, etc.).  Can you find a couple "hauler" numbers in there and send me the numbers?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, my trunk can handle that easily.  Sounds like a plan!  I'm going to inform folks that I will be off Thursday/Friday.  I'll let you what reaction I get.     Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/21/2001 11:30 AM 
 Thanks. I should be there about 7.  You know that I love you very much, Prentice.

 Power shortage shifts attitudes Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001 BY NOAM LEVEY Mercury News Sacramento Bureau California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new poll shows. Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll. ``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very dramatic.'' Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide. Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and 6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top issue. And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply, demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great deal.'' ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a 46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose. Results dismissed The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very hard to communicate that in this state.'' South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004. The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's landmark deregulation five years ago. ``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose. Criticism for Davis But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading California out of its power troubles. Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the governor for not doing more. Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to control the price that California is being forced to pay for power. The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support price caps on electricity. Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power. The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the crisis. But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18 percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8 percent favored federal price controls on generators. That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of power to mine the California market for excessive profits. ``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants. Backing re-regulation Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will come when Californians' power bills start rising next month. ``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the only solution will be re-regulation.'' Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear, however. ``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people worry. ``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''    Mercury News Staff Writer Mike Zapler contributed to this report. 
 No problem.  Let's talk.  I'm really comfortably having you and me and your mom and keith talk about.  I'm very interested in buying Jay's property, but I don't even the details yet.  Here's my suggestion.  If they want to come up that bad, they should.  My agent is a very cool person up there.  Here name is Sharon Burningham.  She is with Coldwell Banker.  Her number is 707.884.5270.  ext. 308.  You should feel free to tell your mom that Prentice and I have always have the intention of buying Jay's place, and we've had a sort of unspoken agreement that he'd give us the first "head's up" when he decided to sell.  To be honest, we didn't expect it to be this quick, but hey, it is what it is.  You can also tell your mom that I'm very happy to talk about partnering with her.  But it's WAY to early right now.  As we discussed, I need to spend some time with Jay---the other very important thing for me is that Jay's a very good friend, and I want to protect that, too.  In the meantime, I think that it would be great for your mom and Keith to have Sharon take them around and show them some killer million--plus--dollar homes and have some fun cruising around and seeing what the area has to offer.  I'm real happy to call Sharon, too.  That sound like a plan?  Where can I call you?  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 05/21/2001 02:38 PM 
 Ditto.  Hope to get to see you in person again soon.  Lay said the CSU meeting went pretty well.  Best, Jeff 
 Oversight.  No other reason.  Thanks for noticing and letting me know.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 05/21/2001 04:03 PM 
 FYI.  Apologies for the oversight of not including you on the list.  If you have any questions, etc. just give a holler (415.782.7822).  Best, Jeff 
 Though I had a somewhat different notion when I initially raised the idea of co-sponsorship, I agree with Lee's observations and think that we should proceed the way he suggests. 
 OK gang, she's hell bent, and I've spent about as much time as I'm willing on this.  Sorry about the hassle---Jimmie, if you hadn't used that colorful language, we wouldn't be in this mess.  Anyway, unless I hear strong protests in the next 30 minutes, I'm writing back to say she can join (and has to do the next case all by her lonesome on the team's behalf as payback).  Lemme know.  Best, Jeff 
 Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file confidential.  Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers. Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates significantly above the Lynch rates. Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates again soon. In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which will require yet additional increases. I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive market and out from under Loretta). I will report back after we've spoken. All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 So far there's Wild Goose, but there in Northern California--have to go through the Wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt.  Lodi's a possibility, but it's well inland, unlike the significantly more strategic storage assets on the coast.  In addition, Lodi's in the process of selling, so there's some uncertainty in the short run.  Bottom line, folks are trying to build competitive storage, but it's in the "emerging" phase in a very hostile environment.  We should discuss further, though; very interesting idea.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 05/22/2001 08:45 AM 
 I'll have Joseph clean up the letter and send you the email/fax #'s etc. for the list, for the cards that I gathered.  Best, Jeff 
 The advocacy ad blitz has started.  I don't know if I have the title correct, but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).  The head of the committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, "the Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and "we" want to make sure that they're held accountable."  Best, Jeff 
 plz call as soon as you have a second.  thx, jeff 
 I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with pro bono financial advice on the crisis.  Hertzberg is still hot on putting all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south of 100% (if this thing gets legs).  Hertzberg asked for, and we provided today, a "fifth scenario," which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.  It's attached.  Will report back with any further developments.  Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with this one.  That file accidentally had the same cents/kwh, noncore rate for both Edison and PG&E.  Edison's rate should be 12.98 cents/kwh NOT 12.21 cents/kwh. It's the line that reads "Total cost to Noncore under CPUC's Recent Decision."  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is. 
 sigh....    Susan M Landwehr 05/22/2001 12:27 PM 
  Greetings Hap: Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.  Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up on filings like these in California prior to filing.  As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous forums.  Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.  Want to make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to get this ridiculous state back on track.  Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical. Thanks much.  Best, Jeff 
 Have messages in to him.    James D Steffes 10/02/2000 02:50 PM 
 Congratulations sweetie:  Everything OK?  So glad to hear.  All the best to all three of you.  Best, Jeff 
 Ideally, we'd leave earlier--gotta go to Napa to pick up the Suburban, Annie, etc.---but otherwise, let's try to leave as close to 9 pm as possible.  Best, Jeff 
 Duly noted.  I'll send you the latest.  I'll include you from this point on in the distribution list.  If it gets to be too much in your in-box, just let me know and I'll try to pare it back.  Here's the bottom line.  Folks have asked me to coordinate California to some degree and there'll be an expectation that we're well coordinated.  Again, this is not at all about making your life more difficult, just a case of being well-informed.  And my apologies for not having included you on the email distribution list sooner.  Best, Jeff    Hap Boyd 05/22/2001 03:01 PM

 To get from the California border down to Mexico, you would get service off of SoCalGas' and SDG&E's tariff (i.e., you have to wheel through SoCalGas and SDG&E to get there.  There may be a single tariff for that service, however (rather than taking service off of two tariffs).  I'll try to get the tariff numbers and get back to you.  All the tariffs are on Sempra's website.  Best, Jeff

 Rosalee:  Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr. Lay?  One is an excel sheet showing the summary of the results of our analyis of the core/noncore market structure that Mr. Lay has been discussing with leaders in California.  The other is a word document explaining the summary tables contents.  If you have any questions, just let me know.  Maureen, can you print out for Steve, too?  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Steve.  FYI.  Got bounced back the first time. 
 woodward is great!  damned good choice.  who's the 12?  and what day? 
 Clearly, there are still some really crazy ideas floating around out there. 
 My apologies, Rosalee.  Not sure what happened.  Let's try again.  Let me know if you're still having problems.  Best, Jeff 
 Jennifer: I think that Jeff (from Transwestern) should take a look and provide any comments that he might have.  Jeff, feel free to send any comments directly to Jennifer (and copy me, too, since I'm always interested in your comments).  Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 FYI. 
 Greetings. Forgive the delays.  The meeting can largely be summarized by the CEC presentation.  I'll have Joseph email it to you.  In a nut shell, there's more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the consumer/business.  The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in California.  The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas infrastructure and do it quickly.   Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry for the delay.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 05/29/2001 12:01 PM 
 I'd blow it off.  Your batting 0.9999999999.  In anybody's book, that's phenomenal.  Don't look back.  And PR, under the circumstances, is doing a stellar job overall.  Vacation was nice.  Thanks.  Bad thing is it made me realize how much more of it I need (and likely ain't gonna get soon).  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 05/29/2001 01:07 PM

 Greetings: Have you seen this?  Any view on whether there's a group of economists who think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to this letter?  P.S. Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of this, but I wasn't altogether successful.  Best, Jeff 
 From Kirsten's second report, sounds like the core/noncore is getting longer legs and moving more quickly.  I'm concerned about Bev speaking on our behalf---only because her knowledge base is quite low---and plan on phoning her to ensure that she has the message down pat.  Thoughts?  Also, I've forewarded the econ letter to Teece to see if we can get the "manifesto" group to respond.  Best, Jeff 
 just calling them as i see them.  i WISH that i were glad to be back.  but who knows, this core/noncore thing just might work .  please keep all fingers and toes crossed indefinitely.  Best, jeff    Karen Denne 05/29/2001 02:50 PM 
 Thanks.  Talked to Rob.  He's going to find out timing and cost to do a bigger American Ass. of Economist number on Wolak & Co., while I work the manifesto gang.  Best, Jeff 
 The bad news is I left my bag with clothes and toiletries at the Dome.  The good news is it's a great excuse to have to go up again this weekend!  Thanks again for everything.  Really nice with only the principals---smaller, more intimate, less mess---and the ping pong table is a HUGE hit.  I hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as I enjoy yours.  Best, Jeff 
 Yeah, tell me about it.   (Payback for what!?!?)  So that means you DON'T enjoy my loving ribbing?  P.S. My butt still feels like there's all these rubberbands wrapped around it......(:    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/29/2001 03:25 PM 
 FYI. For future reference. 
 You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.  And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).  I'd be happy to talk about it if you want some time.  I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second "breaking away" (the one that comes after teen-age-dom).  So it's less about you and much more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).  I hope I'm not confusing matters more.

 Status of core/noncore proposal Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing. Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of "some parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal." Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.  Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors) They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats IOU past due) using their MOU numbers. They said that the model "can work" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this is pretty consistent with our analysis). Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me the results tomorrow AM. Hertzberg is coming up with "additional" twists, however. The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates down). Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B). In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't buy 20-year paper. Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in the event that credit isn't in place by July)  Conversation with the Chamber The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about, e.g., cost-shifting). They were very appreciative, liked the features of our proposal (again) and we agreed to stay in close contact.  Finally, I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn.  Best, Jeff 
 For some reason, the sites not opening.  I'll keep trying and keep you informed.  Best, Jeff 
 You are most welcome, indeed.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/30/2001 09:55 AM 
 What time's the show?  Do we know what station?  Here are my points:  Stop the blame; stop the political rhetoric. If there's evidence that manipulation has occured, produce it--the investigations have been going on for a year.  Stop the McCarthyist tactics. Californians want a real, comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan More supply Less demand No state takeovers; state out of procurement now. A real energy market place (competition and choice) Creditworthy utilities (prices that reflect the true cost of power)     Karen Denne 05/30/2001 11:31 AM 
 you win the big prize! 
 I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his caucus.  Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.  I can make out, however, that it is the core/noncore plan.  I'm attempting to get a better copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.  Please keep confidential that we have a copy.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks:  Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.  Best, Jeff  P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; Hertzberg has it at about 20%. 
 u won't believe this (o yes u will).  karen just called and told me that the event's been cancelled. but don't cancel anything until i get a chance to talk to her live first.  thanks, jeff    Joseph Alamo 05/30/2001 03:25 PM 
 Jennifer: To my knowledge, there's been no decision made to date on this issue of exit fees, either at the PUC or the legislature.  But it's my understanding that the rate increases just imposed by the PUC will NOT apply to DA customers. What happens to customers who switch today, I'm not sure.  Jeanne, any thoughts?    Joseph Alamo 05/30/2001 01:49 PM 
 FYI.  I'll be overnighting to you the analysis done for core/noncore by the Gov's finance people.  Best, Jeff 
 Jennifer:  Please be sure to connect Tom and Nancy, since I had a discussion with her about CA gas and had this stuff sent to her.  Best, Jeff 
 Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief Thursday, May 31, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M N231235.DTL Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers. The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created. "We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and "noncore" users. SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would be those using more than 500 kilowatts. Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar panels, on contract with the utility. That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity. Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to make themselves energy self-sufficient. The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would shift exclusively to the big users. Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates. Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. EDISON 'ENCOURAGED' Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan. A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. "I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution." Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. "We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. "When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," Smith said. Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. They don't want voters to pay because they vote." CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers. "I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," Rosenfield said. The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines. In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

 Municipal utilities warned Governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/31/MN154796.DTL Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators. Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies. The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 power alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities. In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices. He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance. "We're going to get that power one way or another," Davis said. Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California, there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento and Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state. 30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities. He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects full details to be made available within 30 days. Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents, insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations. The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent. RUDE AWAKENING While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Davis needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emulate the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets. Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis insisted they are required to do by law. He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as California faces a summer of potential blackouts. The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed "to make most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market." Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration. Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still "trying very hard to promote this notion that we're all in this together." While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800 megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways. Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes. Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities Association in Sacramento. "I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or involuntarily," the governor said. UNCERTAIN FUTURE It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way. In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in rolling blackouts during power shortages. "I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can turn on their lights somewhere else," said Alan Vallow, director of the utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents.

 To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today. I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes sense.  I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.  Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.  They view it as unfair and punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."  Many questioned Keeley about why the Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.  Keely said that the Assembly is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the Senate (read "Burton").  Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of information used to build the proposal.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  Did we talk to Leopold?  Might be useful to stress that that under noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of competing providers for their service, not just Enron.  Best, Jeff    California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue By Jason Leopold ? 18:00 ET Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would be on the hook. In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this week. The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so "desperate" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse residential consumers out of the equation. "The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing out Edison," the aide said. "We're looking to take the burden off of residential ratepayers." The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as non-core customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its $5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills. Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts. Enron Pushing Access to Customers Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs. Burton and Hertzberg said. An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the California Chamber of Commerce. Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with companies like Enron for their power. Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in place of the utilities. The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in April. The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement forward. State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate energy committee, said there are so many "Plan B's" floating around the Legislature that, "We're going to need to hire an apiculturist." Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's "core and non-core" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions. It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said. Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. "This [plan] would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said. "We just got hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our businesses to other states."

Many months ago, you were sitting in our small conference room and said, "The Governor needs to take control and initiate a negotiation, or summit."  Looks like he finally figured it out. 
 I'll forward the piece to Brulte via email and offer to meet with him when I'm in Sacramento on Monday, or have a phone call with him before Monday to discuss the proposal further if he would like.  Best, Jeff    Rosalee Fleming/ENRON@enronXgate 05/31/2001 06:07 PM 
 Greetings Senator:  I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your message has been forwarded to him.  In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks ago.  It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker Hertzberg).  Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss solutions to California's electricity crisis.  But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have been incurred on their behalf.  I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule permits.  I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you would like to talk before Monday.  If there's anything else I can do, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff Dasovich

 Municipal utilities lambaste Davis threat to seize power David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, June 1, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/01/MN17670.DTL California municipal utilities reacted with shock and anger yesterday to Gov. Gray Davis' threat to seize their excess power if they did not slash prices to below-market rates. "I feel totally betrayed," said George Fraser, general manager of the Northern California Power Agency, an association of 14 municipal utilities. "It's clear to me that the governor doesn't understand the power business." This new dimension to the state's energy woes came as authorities issued their first one-hour warning of imminent blackouts in the Bay Area, only to cancel the warning an hour later when additional power supplies were found. Davis told The Chronicle in an interview Wednesday that some city-owned municipal utilities had charged even higher electricity prices than the out-of- state generators he has accused of gouging California consumers. He said he was prepared to use his executive authority "to get that power one way or another" if the utilities did not lower their prices. The state so far has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity on behalf of cash- strapped Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. "What the governor said makes no sense whatsoever," said Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association. "He was definitely off-base." Jordan said most municipal utilities already provided all surplus power to California's electricity market. However, he said, the municipals buy power at market rates to meet their own shortfalls, and thus have a responsibility to their customers -- local city residents -- to sell any excess supplies at the same sky-high price levels. "Our utilities are going to do what they can to help the state of California," Jordan said. "But they aren't going to do that at the expense of customers." Davis' threat followed a meeting last week with the heads of about a dozen municipal utilities. Participants said the tone of the discussion was generally cordial, and it was understood the governor's office would work up a plan for future electricity purchases. Davis' threat came out of the blue, they said. "We're willing to sell our excess power," said John Roukema, assistant director of Silicon Valley Power in Santa Clara. "But we have to deal with the same market conditions that the governor does." Davis doesn't see it that way. He believes that many municipal utilities are exploiting California's power shortage in the same way that out-of-state generators are walking off with billions of dollars in windfall profits. The governor's top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, said in an interview yesterday that Davis' threat to seize the municipals' power was intended as a reminder that the state expected prompt action on the issue. "We want to be sure that the municipals are not just talking the talk but doing what they say," Freeman said. He said municipal utilities should be selling surplus power at the same level it cost to generate electricity, plus a reasonable markup of about 15 percent. Freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter. Before signing on with the Davis administration, he was head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, by far the state's largest municipal utility. The Los Angeles department has been accused by both federal and state officials of charging some of the highest prices of all for electricity. Earlier this year, it was asking as much as $1,400 per megawatt hour for its output. Frank Salas, the department's chief operating officer, said such prices were necessitated by high production expenses. "We were just recovering our costs," he said. For his part, Freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his watch. "There was tremendous pressure on me to charge more," he said of urgings from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other local officials for higher profits, demands that Freeman said he had resisted. "That pressure may have increased now that I'm gone," he said. "I don't know what they're doing now." The Department of Water and Power's Salas countered that Freeman should know exactly what his former colleagues were doing. "We have the same pricing structure now that we had when he was boss," he said. Fraser at the Northern California Power Agency said it was strange that Davis would be so aggressive in his dealings with the municipals, which provide only about 15 percent of the state's power needs. "He's kicking the little guy," he said. "He's picking on us because he can." E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. 
 I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.  The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear something. 
 Carolyn Kepplinger (sp?) is calling me---no doubt to talk about core/noncore.  Her number's 202.383.2119.  You want to take it? (I hope you say yes.)  Best, Jeff 
 works for me, though i have to hop at 2 pm for another call.  Best, Jeff    Sandra McCubbin 06/01/2001 12:28 PM 
 Dude: No problem.  Sean paid me for his and Molly's dinner and Eldon and Nancy will pay me for theirs.  No problem on the toast--I'm sure the favor will be repaid many times over.  Rite Spot is always great.  I actually got to bed by 11:30, so I was OK yesterday.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 05/31/2001 01:42 PM 
 Talked to Prentice.  She's up for golf, so expect us Saturday night.  Best, Jeff  P.S. Don't forget to water! 
 House power subcommittee. 
 The original proposed messages I distributed for the high tech sector have been put into a power point presentation and include comments received. Many thanks to Margaret Carson, who did much of the heavy lifting.   Additional comments are welcome and suggestions on how to spice up the korny title slide are greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 you're a regulatory laugh riot.  see you then.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 06/01/2001 12:57 PM 
 see yesterday's and today's chronicle  re: price gouging by in-state, municipally-owned utility generators.  will be interesting to see if any anti-trust claims start flying their way.  see you this weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll try to remember my check book....    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 06/01/2001 01:01 PM 
 I'm trying.  I've got cauliflower ear from all the phone calls.  I'll be in Sacramento Monday.  Will keep you apprised.  I followed up with a call to Brulte and I'll try to meet with him on Monday, too.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 06/01/2001 01:01 PM 
 12:30 works for me.  2-330 does not.    Joseph Alamo 06/01/2001 01:32 PM 
 sounds great.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 06/01/2001 01:27 PM 
 Looks great.  I'd like to be able to pick it up at 7 AM.  Thanks very much for the assistance.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 06/01/2001 12:59 PM 
 I recommend that you wait.  I've got a Brazil-focused commercial contact internally that I would like for you to meet with first.  Best, Jeff 
 Got bounced back the first time. 
 will miss you.  hope you have a good trip.  as it turns out, i'm in sacramento all week in close door negotiations trying to settle california's electricity mess.  keep your fingers and toes crossed!  best, jeff 
 i'm very willing, but if it has to be done this week, it ain't going to happen----traveling, hair on fire, etc.  let me know.  hey, did you change jobs?  if so, congratulations.  nice title.  best, Jeff    Joseph Tambornino <josephtambornino@yahoo.com> 06/04/2001 06:52 PM Please respond to josepht 
 Thanks.  I have a contact.  When can you be in Sao Paolo next?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  I am completely buried.  This is is blown.  I'll be in town tonite and= =20 tomorrow nite and we can discuss more then if you like.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, but ain't gonna happen this week.  We'll have to wait till he gets back.  Best, Jeff    Rob Bradley 06/04/2001 08:02 AM 
 I'll need clubs, and I'm right handed. Thanks so much.  Best, Jeff    Ginger Dernehl 06/06/2001 09:49 AM 
 And a very good morning to you!    Maureen McVicker 06/06/2001 09:04 AM 
 Haven't checked my calendar, but I plan to come.  Been WAY too long.  Best, Jeff    Kari Ontko <kontko@home.com> 06/03/2001 05:28 PM Please respond to kontko 
 This got bounced back, too. 
 Hi Lee: Do you know what the subject of the proceeding is?  I'm traveling, but will try to get you info.  Best, Jeff    Lee Huber 06/05/2001 09:34 AM 
 sounds good. let's catch up tomorrow nite.  Best, Jeff    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 06/06/2001 12:14 PM 
 congratulations on the promotion.  let me know what i can do if the effort's still underway next week.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Tambornino <josephtambornino@yahoo.com> 06/06/2001 12:06 PM Please respond to josepht 
 sounds good.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 06/06/2001 12:43 PM 
 Lee: Check the PUC website for information---it sounds like the PUC's inquiry into the adequacy of SoCal's insfrastructure, i.e., in state transportation. Should be a lot about it on their website (www.cpuc.ca.gov).  If you come up empty, leave me a voicemail (415.782.7822) and I'll track things down.  Best, Jeff    Lee Huber 06/06/2001 11:11 AM 
 We're on at 9:30 AM California time.  I'll call you early in the AM to confirm, coordinate, ruminate, etc.  Best, Jeff 
 Christine:  Sorry I haven't replied sooner.  Crazy day.  Consider yourself the 5th member of our team---but remember, no warranties included.  Best, Jeff 
 There you go again, always demanding substance.  I'll fill you in tomorrow on why it's so high level (and repetitive). Believe it or not, Larry Ellison (CEO Oracle) and Scott McNealy (CEO Sun) is the audience--neither's real up to speed on the industry.  PS How's the cover memo for the strategy coming?  Best, Jeff 
 The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.  He's intrigued about the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.  Governor and his folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be another call next Monday.  Will fill you in as things progress.  Thanks again for the pricing sheet.  Please keep all of this highly confidential.  Best, Jeff 
 As my mother likes to say, "You should be on the stage....  the one that left an hour ago." 
 I was worried about this.  Sent it Monday night.  Kept getting bounced back. Could you page me at 888.916.7184 and let me know that you get it?  I'm in Portland.  Also, got Ginger's message re: paragraph on TW deal.  Steffes said you didnt' need right away because EBR got cancelled.  When do you need and do you want just background, or valuation calculations, too? Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Will you send a note to folks regarding the GA meeting here in SF next Thursday? 
 Will do.    Richard Shapiro 10/04/2000 08:58 AM 
 I like the idea.  Particularly in view of the "California Crisis."  Makes our positions that much more compelling and offers at least part of the "solution" for California.    Robert Frank 10/03/2000 01:01 PM 
 Attached are the high tech slides with the correct figure for dollars that the high tech sector spent on electricity in 1999. 
 I'm sure that you'll have a great time arguing our case before the court.  If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.  P.S.  How's things?    Marcie Milner 10/03/2000 11:59 AM 
 Our meetings will be much more effective you attend.  We should try to talk tomorrow or Friday.    Robert Frank 10/04/2000 09:37 AM 
 Good questions for which I don't currently have answers.    James D Steffes 10/03/2000 10:17 AM 
 If it's truly the real thing.  I'll take two cases.  Thanks for asking.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/04/2000 11:49 AM 
 I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I can't recall, I'm sending to all.  First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the "clarifications" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a fatal flaw--significant probability.)  Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)  Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with something remotely similar.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Let me know when you would like to discuss the "value" that GA brought to our pipeline group. (We discussed it when I was in Houston week before last.)  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Sarah.  Question:  Could we, and should we, attempt to pre-empt the FERC report and try to get press coverage of the BP paper before FERC releases the results of its investigation?    Sarah Novosel 10/04/2000 11:58 AM 
 real meaning real acacia.  don't care about labeling.  what would you compare to in quality?  seems to me that one can't beat $5/bottle for acacia, non? what cheese?  man, you saw a great game.  i was portland for the past couple days, saw some of the game yesterday at the airport (plane was delayed).  GO GIANTS!    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/05/2000 10:31 AM 
 Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.  Also, one question:  Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have that right? 
 If you have any questions, don't hesitate. 
 Hey, no problem.  I'll call Badeer.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/05/2000 01:02 PM 
 Steve:  Let me know if you'd like to discuss.  I like Tim's idea re: maybe you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with Schroeder re: Littlechild.  Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am surprised to see it turn up in print.  Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one but that we're always interested in working together.  Best, Jeff    Tim Belden@ECT 10/05/2000 01:00 PM 
 Between you and me, I don't think California is an option at this point. 
 Mr. DeMille would like to know if you're ready for your close-up.    Susan Scott 10/05/2000 01:50 PM 
 Couple of thoughts:  In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to a pounding they're taking from Wall Street). This will likely increase the pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t. finding a way out of the IOU undercollection problem.   The increased pressure to act in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.   Regarding the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having the adminstration cook up something less preferable. 
 I doubt that anyone in accounting has it, and I'm not sure to whom in accounting to send it.  Suggestions?  I think that Bowen & Co. could likely help us out on this first filing.  Also, Sue, regarding NY:  I have a call into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up.  Haven't heard back yet.    Sue Nord 10/05/2000 02:08 PM 
 FYI.  According to Roger, if the freeze is extended out toward 2004 for PG&E and Edison, his book makes BIG money. 
 FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation. Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier." Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the next version of the slides.  Few points:  There are a few holes (pre-quals and process in particular)--my brain began to fail.  But I think there's enough of a structure so that we can easily finalize by tomorrow. I didn't have an electronic version of Whaley's slides, so I couldn't integrate them.  But I don't think it will take much to do the integration. Some of Whaley's slides have a strong marketing slant--we should think hard about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity. We still have some wordsmithing to do re: participate, run the auction, or participate and run the auction.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I love you, too.   Seriously, appreciate the feedback.  I was working from a great first cut.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/05/2000 08:02 PM 
 no classes.  just lots of studying.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/05/2000 08:13 PM 
 Agree completely.  Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, etc.  Just a thought.  Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the quick action/message we're looking for.    James D Steffes 10/05/2000 08:30 PM 
 Anyone out there know why FERC has asked the PX for still more data? 
 Richard:  Looks good.  One comment:  Under the section "Generating Documents:  Requests 12, 14 and 18,"  I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending."  To further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of increased wholesale purchases.  Paul Kaufman would have details of the request.  Hope your son's doing well.  Best, Jeff    Richard B Sanders@ECT 10/06/2000 09:16 AM 
 I can be on the call. 
 Mitch:  Paul Kaufman mentioned that you'd like to see the testimony that Steve Kean (at a congressional field hearing in San Diego) and I (at a FERC field hearing in San Diego) gave a few weeks ago.  Steve had prepared remarks. They are attached.  I did not have prepared remarks, but I've attached my talking points.  My talking points were not made public, however, so please keep them private.  Finally, I'm trying to get a transcript of the FERC hearing.  If you would like a copy, please let me know.  And if there's anything else that I can do, please don't hestitate to contact me.  Best, Jeff 
 BEEP stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the ISO develops on the basis of bids and offers.  The problem is that the plants the ISO ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order developed from the bids/offers, and the ISO has never been clear about the decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch.  Everyone, including Belden, thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent. 
 does tomorrow work? 
 Yes, will be on call. 
 I apologize for being tardy.  I can have my IRS to you by Monday. 
 Hi Delaney:  I won't need a room.  Did you want me to participate on a panel?  If so, which day and at what time?  Who else will be on the panel?  Inquiring minds would love to know.  Best, Jeff      "Delaney Hunter" <dhunter@smithandkempton.com> 10/05/2000 07:01 PM Please respond to dhunter 
 Susan Scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group (TW).  I met her as part of the California PUC's gas restructuring case.  For some time she's been inquiring about Government Affairs.  She called me yesterday and mentioned that she's very  interested in exploring if there are any opportunities in GA.  From my experience, Susan is highly competent and very professional and I think TW would say the same.  She likes her work but wants a new challenge.  I told her I'd inquire about whether someone would be interested in talking with her. I think that it would be useful for you to chat with her.  Thoughts?  Susan would like to keep it confidential at this point. 
 I don't think that the stranded cost issue has been squarely addressed. 
 Has Sue gotten in touch with you.  And have you contacted Tim Belden in Portland?  He is the absolute guru on this stuff. 
 Lee:  I'm not certain that it will be possible to get Skilling, but I'll get back to you soon.  Also, I want to manage expectations a bit about the possibility of having Enron stream the conference.  Just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.  I'd prefer that it not go out in any announcement at this juncture.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff    "Lee S. Friedman" <lfried@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 10/04/2000 05:52 PM 
 Couple of brief comments:  1) There is a new and growing drum beat to reduce California's wholesale price caps further (i.e., below $250, with some suggesting $100).  We need to discuss strategy very soon. 2)  I'm attempting to arrange a meeting between ENA (Calger) and Sempra (CFO) to discuss commercial opportunities. 
 FYI. Great news.  PUC "fixed" the language glitches in the original decision granting ETI its certificate and voted it out yesterday.  So we're good to go on filing our final tariff.  It's attached.  Please take a look and let's discuss ASAP (Monday?) so we can get if on file at the CPUC.  Best, Jeff 
 thursday or friday works best for me.     Scott Bolton @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 08/29/2000 10:19 AM 
 It was covered extensively in today's LA Times.    Michael McDonald@ECT 10/06/2000 01:14 PM 
 Will do.    Richard Shapiro 10/06/2000 02:26 PM 
 Chris:  Here are the slides with your suggested edits incorporated.  Take a look. Also, feel free to integrate the portions that you're working on ("deal bench," pre-quals, etc.) directly into the presentation, or I'd be happy to do it.  I'm at 415.782.7822.  I'm contacting Benevides about putting an illustrative slide together representing the base and peak blocks.  Best, Jeff 
 Prentice ever get back to you regarding logistics about tomorrow nite?  What time is dinner by the way. I'm supposed to do something from 3-4, but could come up directly thereafter. 
 Rebecca Smith called.  She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM California.  Topics:  1) How California got here.  2) How California can get out of it.  Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?  I think I've got the messages pretty well down, but might be useful to touch base.  Let me know.  Hear's a message I'm practicing:  "Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the article that I referred to.  Could you please email or fax to me the Commission's decision denying Edison's emergency motion?  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Al Gore 
 yes.    Michael McDonald@ECT 10/06/2000 03:28 PM 
 Well, wouldn't you know it.  I couldn't find the most recent version in my email.  But here's the 10.03 version with a few edits.  Couple of other points:  I still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an attachment. I still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option Rick may be thinking about "Maintain presence with fewer resources."  Think it's something we need to focus on.  Have a great weekend.  Spreadsheet to follow. 
 I confess that I haven't even looked at the bloody thing.  How many questions?  Should we divide them up and pass around as usual?    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 10/06/2000 01:24 PM 
 Heres' the spreadsheet.  I added "regulatory intelligence and expertise" right after the top 5.  Check it out.  Best, Jeff 
 thursday or friday works best for me, but i might be able to make wednesday, too. 
 Understanding there won't be a call on Monday, here's a draft of the auction slides that we've been working on for folks to review. 
 I'm slow, but I catch on eventually.  Steffes was fired up when he called. Sounds like the meeting went pretty well.  Have a good weekend.  Best, Jeff    Richard Shapiro 10/06/2000 10:25 PM 
 Haven't heard of them.  And I'm not aware of any new tariffs that offer those kinds of savings, but we'll check around. 
 Hello?  I guess everyone's wrapped up in the baseball playoffs and the debates.  There are 4 questions.  Since the SF people did 1&2 last time and the East Bay contingent did 3&4, seems we can switch this time.  SF takes 3&4; East Bay 1&2.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  I'm going to read the material and the case today.  Should we compare notes (via email) on questions 3&4 by tomorrow (Sunday) before lunch?  Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 You're the man.  Thanks.  I'll coordinate with Kim and the new recruit.    JcjCal02@aol.com 10/07/2000 11:20 AM 
 I'll get you for this.    JcjCal02@aol.com 10/07/2000 12:11 PM 
 Here's a very rough shot at #'s 3&4.  I think 4's worded very strangely (thus my strange answer).  Anyway, thought I'd throw something together to get the ball rolling.  I'll keep thinking about and send another dispatch later today or first thing tomorrow morning.  Best, Jeff 
 Looks good, Kim.  Thanks. 
 sorry about that. meant to send to tracy (no "e") cooper in Portland, Oregon. 
 Agreed.  I'll handle it.  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 10/08/2000 05:54 PM 
 Looks good.  Thanks.  See you tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  How's things?  Got your message.  Best place to get your hands on the report is the CalPX website.  If you have any problems, let me know. I'll try to write a note discussing our conversation on Friday by end of day.  Best, Jeff 
 Seems that we could provide Lay/Skilling with the power point slides as prep for any calls.  As a starter, it would be useful to provide McNeally with a letter that he could send to federal and state decision makers.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 10/06/2000 06:47 PM 
 Greetings: Any word about whether the PUC bought our proposal? Best, Jeff 
 Strange.  I think that I received an email from someone with the report attached.  Let me scour my emails.  If and when I find it, I'll forward. Disheartening that you can't find a document that's getting so much press. Great website...    Michael Etringer@ECT 10/09/2000 11:09 AM 
 Please let me know if you want me to participate in any gas panels.  And my feelings won't be hurt if you say no.  Worry not.  Just need to know so that I can prepare some materials.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's one that's "final," not draft, that just came out.  I'm assuming that this is the one the press is refering to.  Let me know that you think. 
 Gee, I don't know what came over me.  Apologies.    Richard B Sanders@ECT 10/09/2000 01:02 PM 
 Darlin', the last thing I want is to be rid of you. Get in touch when you can.  And next time you're in town, I'm buying.  Best, Jeff 
 Just spent about 90 minutes with Rebecca.  She left with a very good understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions.  She also spent time asking me how I thought other players would respond to the IOU request for a big check to cover the undercollections.  She expects to have a "big picture" story--covering AB 1890s past, present & future--completed in the next couple of weeks.  In Rebecca's words, she wants the story to "shake things up."  She's very upset with how the utilities are handling it.  I told her we were less concerned with "he said/she said" and more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair to everyone.  Mark and Karen:  In my long history with Rebecca, it has always been understood that our conversations are off the record and background. Invariably, at the end of the conversation, Rebecca tells me that she intends to call later and cajole the daylights out of me in an attempt to use some of my more colorful quotes.  It was no different this time.  If anyone wants more details, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Jimmie's the "compiler" this time.  You're stuff was good.  Whether he has time to incorporate remains to be seen.  But I wouldn't sweat it.  We can talk more tonite about our somewhat "loose" but thus far effective means for getting these things done every week.

 Here's Paul's memo with Mona's edits and a couple of my edits.  It's been shipped off to Paul.  I assume he'll be sending it out tomorrow.  If there's any more questions, edits, comments, etc., please give Paul a buzz.  Best, Jeff 
 In the office all week. 
 got it. 
 They've asked me to be on a gas panel.  I've said yes, but hadn't planned at this point on attending any of the conference other than the panel. 
 Bowen called, and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from Texas at the same time, we're on for 9:30 AM.  He'll call back if there's a problem. Also, he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v. AFTS and also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best time to make sure what we file in good ol' CA is consistent with our other filings.  Best, Jeff 
 NARUC's meeting at ground-zero dereg (San Diego) in mid-November, right after the elections.  Might be a good opportunity for a PR event.

 FYI.  Here's what Dave pulled together on Friday.  I talked to him and told him I was going to make a single power point out of the info and then run it by him for review and comment. 
 Shoot.  Love to, but I have a final on Sunday--yes Sunday--the 10th.  Hey, thanks for hanging up on me on Friday. 
 Ms Bennett: Thanks for the voicemail.  Couldn't locate the files you sent in August (uemail now deletes automatically, which may be the problem).  Could you forward a copy to Mr Yang?  Most appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 I've got my car today.  If you need a ride---there, back, or both--just let me know. 
 Check it out. 
 Figures.  I'll see if I can find that needle in that haystack and get back to you. 
 Hi:  I was surprised to see you at the I-House last nite.  Haven't seen you for a while.  Was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was extremely popular and I didn't want to intrude.  This is the first travel-free week I've had in a long time.  You want to try to have lunch?  Or we could meet at a non-I-House place during the break and catch up if you like.  Dying to hear about Montana and your possible new life as a day student.  Did you manage to get away last Thursday?  Best, Jeff 
 Harry:  FYI.  First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by AB 970 is 10.7.  Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office). Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.  URL for the event is included below.  Best, Jeff  http://www.energy.ca.gov/efficiency/ab970/notices/2000-09-29_notice.html    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/10/2000 10:41 AM 
 Mike:  We'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case.  We'd originally agreed to a flat fee of $13, 500 (if memory serves) with a bonus for coming in under the cap.  You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according to my records) for over $25,000.  As you recall, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings and associated briefs.  I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset.  With that in mind, I believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.  However, in light of the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that.  If you'd like to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it.  Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Off what hook?    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/10/2000 11:04 AM 
 Thursday, 9.7, works for me for meeting #1. 
 Seems like information that we'd want to get our hands on, non?

 EBS Update Gov Davis/Skilling Update Meeting w/Sempra Coffee with Rebecca Smith QF support for ENA Miscellaneous    Joseph Alamo 10/10/2000 12:37 PM 
 Are folks available for a call tomorrow at 9 AM to begin preparing for the meeting with Sempra next week? 
 Based on last nite's discussion, here's the coordinator list:  Christine--11.6--Teltronica Dylan--11.13--Nutra Kim--11.1--Agro Feed Jeff--11.27--Global Industries Jimmie--12.4--Daimler-Benz  We also decided that: 1) we'd continue with the SF/East Bay split 2) each group should combine the answers into one document prior to sending to the coordinator for final compilation 3) we'd distribute draft answers to the entire group, since some questions feed off of others 4) we'd get finalized responses to the coordinator no later than 4 PM on Sunday  Let me know if this tracks with others' memories.

 Given that Peace is likely going to try to push legislation to merge the ISO and PX and other nasty things, likely makes sense to listen in on our message development, tactics in addressing the LMP problem.  You think there'd be any problem with that?  If not, could you pass along the call in number?  Thanks, Jeff 
 love one.  thanks. 
 good job.    Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 10/10/2000 03:30 PM 
 Thanks, I'll set up a call. 
 We talked about this in detail with Steve when he was in Houston. Please check with him.  The idea is that there would be the flexibility necessary to do just about anything.  Also, there are problems with the decision that Steve was going to talk with Pulsifer about.  Need to get status of those conversations.My understanding was that, if there's a problem with the decision, perhaps our filing would be pushed a bit past the Tuesday.  We'll need to find that out, too. 
 thanks.  i'll set up the call. 
 where are you?  my phone's been on since you paged me.  i didn't get any tickets.  i love you oodles.  (you slobbery ol' sniffly day student doggie.)    Prentice Sellers <psellers@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 10/10/2000 03:51 PM

 Hi.  Please set up a call for 60 minutes for tomorrow, 10.11.00 for 11 AM CALIFORNIA time and distribute info to the list of folks below.  Thank you very much. 
 Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.  Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities.  But before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles call for a wee bit of polling.  Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses pronto.  If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over.  Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight.  Here are the questions:  Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity?  Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear from other folks.  If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome.  Same goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may influence where we eat).  Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.  Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES and ENA) or confine it to GA? Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA? We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December.  What's your preference.  Is there a day that just won't work?  Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.  Best, Jeff

 Attached is a "plant siting" slide for the next Skilling/Davis meeting.  I developed it from background materials that Dave Parquet pulled together. This version includes Daves' comments.  His comments are in CAPS.  Best, Jeff 
 Now I understand why you were talking to Rubin and Summers.  Sounds like an outstanding hire.  Congratulations.  Exciting changes for exciting times. 
 Greetings:  Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM (PDT).  A Little Background: Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a "festooned" arrangement (i.e., exit sea at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km. At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN. At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP. Will deploy DWDM. Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific systems. In addition to "loops" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF and Monterey. Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial leg). Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego to create a complete loop. Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from Coastal Commission. Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) built and lit by end of Q1 2001. Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey altogether. The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being "clueless" when it comes to marketing the capacity. Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in (per Ethan's emails). They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them. Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.  Best, Jeff 
 position on what? 
 Congratulations one and all.  Very exciting, and well deserved to boot.  Look forward to working with you in your new roles.  Best, Jeff 
 As a follow-up to our call.  Here is some additional information regarding QF pricing issues.  QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full PX prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have switched. The concern is that the Commission's ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices will force the QFs that have switched to "refund" some of the payments they've received (e.g., under a "PX minus" mechanism).  The majority of QFs are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the PUC (except those remotely located QFs who will take a big GMM hit). As we discussed, the Commission strongly rejected Edison's emergency motion regarding the gas piece of the QF pricing formula. Recall also that a couple of months ago

 Bill Reed Sempra's "Chief Regulatory Officer" will replace Gary Cotton on the ISO Board. 
 Wednesday, Dec. 13th would work best for me. 
 FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra. ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.  Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).  Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey Tim:  Calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with Sempra to try to do a gas outsource deal.  We're meeting with the CFO and their Chief Reg Officer next Thursday.  On a call today, we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them, too, while we're there. Laird Dyer's going to call you for indicative prices (same drill we did for Skilling).  If you have any questions, or want me to fill you in more, just give a holler, or check in with Chris.  Best, Jeff

 Hi.  Hope the ride back to Sacramento went OK last nite.  It was nice to see you and catch up. I'm sorry things are so crazy, but in spite of it all, your attitude's pretty good.  And your new suede jacket is gorgeous.  I know your life is very complicated and I don't want to make it worse, but if you ever have the time and inclination to go to lunch, dinner, movie, whatever, I'd definitely be up for it.  Hang in there.  Hope to catch up again soon.  Best, Jeff

 thanks.  i'll be here. 
 FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the "misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it. Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:  Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government. David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also set up the Governing Boards.

 DJ PG&E Says Won't Try To Escape Rate Freeze For Now >PCG  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to lift California's state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition to a deregulated market, saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile power prices, senior company officials said Wednesday.  "We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. But that view might change in the future," said a senior company official, who requested anonymity.  PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday to discuss plans for repairing a "not workably competitive power market" and several steps the utility plans to file with federal regulators to do that.  One proposal that is expected to be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price for power would be predetermined based on generation costs. The company wants to temporarily put an end to market-based rates.  The utility will also request that California's independent system operator reduce the wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from $250/MWh.  Company officials said those steps would allow them to recover billions of dollars in unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power prices and protect retail customers.  PG&E said generators would still be able to make a profit on power sold in California with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the state's power supply would be in jeopardy from such an action.  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com

 Hi Kim: Any luck withJackie re: getting together to start the project?  And if there's anything else I can do re: your meeting on Monday, don't hesitate.  Leave me a voicemail and let me know how the meeting goes.  I'll be in Vancouver with the EBS gang Monday/Tuesday, and if all goes well maybe I can chat up some folks while I'm there.  Best, Jeff

 Great idea.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/13/2000 07:19 AM 
 My understanding is that the cap is $2500, but that the PX has filed with FERC to change it ot $350.  My understanding is that FERC has not acted on the request to change it to $350, but I could be wrong.  Dave, Mary, is this your understanding?    Jeannie Mandelker@ECT 10/13/2000 08:03 AM

 I think it would be a good idea to have Ron Carroll in Watkiss' shop to do a parallel analysis to what we're going to have Mike Day do.  Ron's very good and has done much work on these sortrs of issues.  You comfortable with that? 
 My pleasure.  By the way, we're not talking after what the NY baseball teams did to the poor Bay Area teams.  Best, Jeff    Jeannie Mandelker@ECT 10/13/2000 11:00 AM 
 I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, we can make that decision at that time.  One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference. That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult (impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout to get them to back off.    Steven J Kean 10/13/2000 11:06 AM 
 I've been asked for a copy of the transcript from the FERC hearing in S.D. Any chance of getting that?  And do you folks have a copy of the Peace letter (treatise) sent to FERC last week?  If so, could you fax it to 415.782.7854? Many thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Mary.  Did the PUC accept our deal re: information from the subpoena? 
 Monday/Tuesday--Vancouver, BC for EBS meeting Wed--In office Thurs--In office Friday--In office 
 Steve: I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.  May be useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of procurement.  Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.  I'm also going to give you the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for prices at SP15.  Best, Jeff 
 You're in.  Yes, I was thinking of offering up my office.  Also, what do you think about getting together real soon to start setting up the model for our finance paper?  We'll have to do the research, but I think setting the model up will be about 75% of the project.  Best, Jeff    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 10/13/2000 01:09 PM

 Here are the very indicative prices Tim gave us for 5 year deals at SP15. They'll likely  change by the time we meet with Sempra on Thursday.  25 MW, on peak (6X16):  $53/MWh 25 MW, base load (7X24):  $45/MWh 500 MW, on peak (6X16):  $55/MWh 500 MW, base load (7X24):  $47/MWh

 Thanks.  Didn't get it the first time.  Good comments.  I'm actually in Vancouver today (Monday) and tomorrow.  Let's keep sending back and forth and get together Wednesday morning to finalize.  I'll get a hold of Calger for his comments.    You can leave messages on my voicemail, too.  Best, Jeff    Laird Dyer@ECT 10/16/2000 09:15 AM 
 Will do. Thanks. 
 Good morning professor: Unfortunately, I'm traveling on business today (it's raing in Vancouver) and can't attend class tonite.  I was wondering if you'd be distributing the take home midterm in this evening's class.  Also, could you resend the access code for the Craftmade case?  I believe that I copied it down incorrectly.  Thank you very much.  Best, Jeff 
 OK, lots of folks are interested.  Given that section is on Saturday, I propose 10 AM, this Sunday, at my office (101 California, Suite 1950).  If folks have a real problem with that, let me know.  Also, please RSVP so that I can arrange things with building security.  Best, Jeff    Jeff Dasovich 10/12/2000 08:46 PM 
 Thanks for the dinners, and the breakfast, and the company.  It was fun.  And don't get cranky, but I'm going to be in and out of things this weekend since I have midterms Monday and Tuesday.  Likely means that I'll be studying in Berkeley and SF during the days on Sat and Sun but will be present for the evenings.  H0pe that works.  Kisses, Jeff  PS I'm trying, lord knows I'm trying, to stay out of it, but it's going to start raining up at the Dome very, very soon....... 
 Thank you.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 10/16/2000 03:31 PM 
 In case word hasn't gotten around, ENA learned COB Friday, that it has been chosen to engage in further negotiations with the ISO for about 450 MWs of projects.  The preliminary award is based on ENA's response to the RFQ that the ISO issued last month for "emergency resources." 
 Howdy:  Just between thee and me, I think this note gets to some of the challenges we faced and discussed as part of our "group gropes" over the last several months.  With Sue coming back on Tuesday, and in the spirt of our gropes, it might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead.  May even result in the same outcome on how to proceed, but a little "process" on the front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel.  Anywho, just my two cents.  Hope your meetings in Salem went well.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the info.  Congratz on the deal. 
 FYI.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/17/2000 07:40 AM 
 You bet.    "Sama, Anil" <anil.sama@intel.com> 10/17/2000 11:49 AM 
 Yes, I was in Vancouver from last Sunday evening through late yesterday afternoon.  Thank you for checking.    Tresea Parker 10/17/2000 03:47 PM 
 Sure makes sense.  One concern.  If they buy up to 80% of load, do we run the risk of "stranded cost" problem later down the road when we hit the backwardated part of the curve.  Hinges on the term of the contract.  Sort of chicken and egg problem.  If the buy for short terms, the prices will be high, if they buy for longer terms, the prices will be lower, but the risk of stranded cost rises.  Thoughts?    Margaret Carson 10/18/2000 08:33 AM 
 I'm sorry.  Things are so busy that I grabbed an old list that I thought everyone was on.  You are most welcome indeed.  My office (101 Cal, Suite 1950, from 10 am to noon).   Best, Jeff    Carolyn Vavrek <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 10/18/2000 10:06 AM 
 Prentice get in touch?  We're coming on Saturday---i'll likely bet there around 4 or 5.  I'll bring the money then.  In the meantime, can I order a case of coast zin and one of cab for pick up and payment this weekend, too?  Your ol' boozer Jeff    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/18/2000 10:16 AM 
 macaroni and cheese will be fine.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/18/2000 12:07 PM 
 Thanks.  do i need to do anything with the form? 
 FYI. 
 You're a star. Thanks. 
 oops. sunday. 
 thanks a bunch.  just got it.  really appreciate it.  yes, thinking about going on saturday.  and we s.f. folks are getting together for (yet another) review on Sunday from 10 am to noon at my office.  you're welcome to come. 
 Well, you don't have voice mail yet I see.  Could you give me a call when you get a minute (I know that will be tough for the next couple of days) regarding Margo's voice mail to me.   I'd like to talk about one other item as well.  Thanks a bunch. 
 Great.  Thanks Seabron.    Mary Hain@ECT 10/18/2000 05:47 PM 
 Knew you'd be dying to know that Barry Staw will be teaching a class on "Creativity" in the Spring.  Be sure to reserve your place today!  Best, Jeff 
 I just figured it was a way for you to finally track him down---you know, show up at his class and get midevil on his ass for a few minutes....  That is a great solution!  You mean work part time, or go to school part time.  Very selfishly, I'm of course very glad that you're staying in the evening program.  We're actually getting together on Sunday (I hope I didn't mess things up).  Yes, it's for finance, though you're welcome to join---we can use all the help that we can get.  I'm really glad to hear that things are going better.  You seemed in pretty good spirits on Tuesday, though I guess that could have partially been due to the big celebration over getting your first ticket.  Congratulations!  I'll buy you a beer.  I have a feeling that the only reason you haven't gotten one until now is because you've managed to talk your way out of many.  Best, Jeff    Courtney Abernathy <courtney_abernathy@yahoo.com> 10/19/2000 09:11 AM 
 Dadburnit!  You're not going to believe this.  I'm going to be in---you guessed it---Houston.  Shewt.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/19/2000 09:50 AM 
 Oh shit.  we forgot to get our picks in. if you page me between 10:45 and 1 PM i can call you and we can figure them out.  xoxoxooxo    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/19/2000 09:50 AM

 FYI.  I didn't receive email yesterday, and I only started receiving them today at 11 AM.  Quesiton:  After Clinton's speech, don't you think the convention is going to cry when they have to sit through Al Gore?  I'm worried----he's so pathetic. 
 Greetings: Wow, lots of fun out there, eh?  Don't know what it will be like without Steve Peace around any more....  I have a very mundane question, though.  What prices for intrastate capacity did the PUC finally come up with in the Sempra BCAP for large generators under the new "Sempra-wide" rate doctrine?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 First apologies if you're getting this and you ain't even in finance---it's a study list from last year.  If it's annoying the heck out of you.  Write back and I'll try to modify the list.  Second, please forward to those you know I've missed.  Just to clarify.  Meet at my office on Sunday from 10 am to Noon.  Please bring specific questions.  We'll go round the room and let folks ask questions and the group will attempt to answer them.  Best Jeff    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 10/16/2000 02:43 PM 
 Excellent.  We've been wondering why we've been excluded from the bob-zine= =20 mailing list. =20  Bob:  Nothing personal but I hope both NY teams lose in the world series.  Best, Jeff 
 Got it.  The sure-fire way to get me is at "jdasovic@enron.com."  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Mary: When Seab completes the draft of his reader-friendly exec summary, could you make sure that Karen gets a copy to review?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 good idea.  epsa, too?    Mary Hain@ECT 10/19/2000 03:19 PM 
 Ok.  Here it is.  Quick and dirty.  Make any changes you like.  You're right, if anyone's going to beat St. Louis, it's going to be KC, but I took St. Louis. 
 like, are you back? 
 Greetings Folks:  Any chance of finalizing the California tariff Monday morning (have a call, say, 7:30/8:00 AM PDT)?  Let me know.  Hope all's well with all.  Best, Jeff 
 Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week? 
 I have the distinct impression that you're glad this has been finalized.... 
 'Thanks a million.  Agree that humor is needed right now, though it's in short supply, so to speak.... 
 Thanks.  Remind me to tell you the story of the time that I was on a panel with him. Yours is the most succint description of him that I've heard to date.  Was curious whether his rant was getting any traction with people that matter.  Sounds like it isn't.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/19/2000 05:36 PM 
 yes.  be happy to talk tomorrow.  just give a holler when you've a minute. thanks. 
 welcome to the assylum, sue and mona.    Joseph Alamo 10/19/2000 06:11 PM 
 Thanks for taking care of it.  Love to room together.  See you Sunday.    Peter deVroede <devroede@haas.berkeley.edu> 10/19/2000 10:48 PM 
 Lara: I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a deal with them).   That's a date that I can't change.  I can meet on Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange  Best, Jeff    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 07:41 AM 
 Thanks, Mark.  Sounds good.  As it turns out, there is a very slight chance that I might be on the panel in California with Prof. Littlechild.  I'll take you/him up on the offer to get together while he's here.  Best, Jeff    Mark Schroeder@ECT 10/20/2000 04:48 AM 
 Unfortunately, I have to get on a plane and go to LA around that time.  If it works better, we can discuss on Tueday morning/early afternoon.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Sue Nord 10/19/2000 10:30 PM 
 Thanks so much for the gifts.  Very sweet.  Sorry I was rushed, but I've got a big bad finance midterm on Tuesday that I ain't ready for and work's nuts. But I really want to hear more about the trip.  Sounds like it was a blast.  You looked lovely in the pictures, all dressed up a la l'Italienne, and you look lovely in your everyday sweatshirt and jeans, too.  (Don't sweat it.)  Prentice and I were planning on going to the Shea's tonite.  You guys going?  Also, I'd love to talk to you this weekend if possible about Prentice's bday festivities. 
 plz call asap when you get a break re: FERC order yesterday on California. 
 did i, or did i not, already give you mine.  signed, confused. 
 plz call at 415.782.7822. 
 Good idea.  Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D. with Sempra execs.  My apologies.  But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference would be to participate in the "first" meeting.    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 11:14 AM 
 actually, i know it's from 10-2, but i don't know where.    "Chris Neale" <chrisjneale@hotmail.com> 10/20/2000 11:03 AM 
 You're a gem.  Thanks.    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 11:46 AM 
 thanks a million. 
 Glad to see that you made it back to Portland.  Sorry about the mess. 
 FYI.  One of our potential competitors.  The VP of biz dev at perfect.com is a very good friend of mine.  Please forward to anyone I may have inadvertently missed.  Best, Jeff   http://www.destinationcrm.com/ec/dcrm_ec_article.asp?id=64 
 You can count me in for $20. 
 Don:  See attached from today's WSJ. 
 You by chance know where the review is tomorrow?  It's from 10 am to 2 pm, right?  Thanks a bunch. 
 Thanks.  See you tomorrow. 
 fyi. 
 Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.  The description of the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.  $100 cap for "old" generation; "new" generation would be exempt. FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of their power. For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100 cap, and the $250 cap will apply. Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward market. Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market will be penalized (details to be "ironed" out).  The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today. 
 No sweat.  Not a problem.  Summary will do fine.  Let's definitely try to coordinate for the next meeting.  You have a great weekend, too.  Best, Jeff    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 04:20 PM 
 Well, it's a start, but it needs work.  See you in LA.  Hey, I just forgot, you haven't sent me the address of where it is I'm going! 
 No need for thanks.  These are busy times.  Take care.    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 05:43 PM 
 Thanks.  We're going to do it with ENA---dinner at Morton's (yes, it's beef, beef, beef).  Then "Stomp" afterwards.  Taking place on Friday the 15th.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/23/2000 11:43 AM 
 Greetings David:  Just checking in to gauge how you folks are doing in cobbling together a proposal and to see if any roadblocks have been encountered.  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff

 sorry, was traveling in LA yesterday.  what's up. 
 Well, you're just a bit late.  Peter de Vroede already teamed me with him. But I am honored to have been considered.  Thanks. 
 Hi Meg: My understanding is that Peter de Vroede has signed me up with him to room at the offsite.  Your records indicate the same?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 glad to here it.  best of luck.  let us know the locales of your gigs.  be great to see you perform.  in any case, hope to see you when you back in december.  best, jeff 
 you, too. thanks. 
 FYI.  For meeting with PG&E (which is Tues., Oct. 31, from 10 am-Noon (PDT) in Enron's SF offices.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim:  To say that there was gaming in the UK pool is a significant understatement.  Couple thoughts...I'm pretty sure that Seab has done extensive analysis on the UK and he'd likely therefore be very useful in developing rebuttal. (Though very close to it at one point, I've been removed for a few years.)  Also, Schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some insights, and seems that Schroeder's pretty close now with Littlechild---that might be another avenue for information to rebut.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Lee:  Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have "generating company" rep on the agenda.  Enron does not see itself as a generating company.  In fact, the only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in Southern California.  Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep? Hope that's not a problem.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings All: If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.  Steve Bowen & Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of weeks ago in Houston.  Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review. Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.  Thoughts?  P.S.  Some good news.  Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona (in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.  Well, I've spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.  Best, Jeff 
 My apologies.  I thought we had discussed me being on the first panel.  Thus, my previous note.  I see that I'm on the second, however.  Sorry for the confusion.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, 9:35 would be better.  Thanks for asking.  Best, Jeff    Diane Dimeff <dimeff@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> Sent by: owner-eveningmba@Haas.Berkeley.EDU 10/24/2000 01:26 PM Please respond to Diane Dimeff

 I could do it in the morning.  Say, before 11 am.   that work?    Lysa Akin@ECT 10/24/2000 04:36 PM 
 but my preference is to have it done before 10 am PST---got to catch a flight for houston.    Lysa Akin@ECT 10/24/2000 04:36 PM 
 need correct pin code for call with sanders.  thanks, jeff 
 We'll send a card.  She's 19?  Well, if we have to, we'll take some tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too.  Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road while my is doing my road at the end of the month?   He's going to fax me the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.  To be honest, the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this guy is really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.  He's pretty willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to Rolls Royce-style road.  And if you want to take a pass, that's of course great, too.  I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know. 
 what's the number? 
 Steve:  Attached is a memo that reponds to your question:  "Can the solution to the utilities' undecollection problem take place at the PUC, or is a legislative fix required?"  As we discussed, I'm also attaching a memo from Mike Day on the issue.  Bottom line:  It's within the PUC's jurisdiction to solve the problem, but the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the Legislature in the next session.  If you, or anyone on the distribution, have any questions, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for you help, Simon.  And Margaret, as always, thank you very much. 
 Got a call that Loretta Lynch and Rod Wright, among others, spoke at yesterday's annual meeting of regulation lawyers.  The following was very briefly relayed to me:  President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---if you "come knocking on her door, that's a strike against you."  One should participate, along with the rest of the public, through the hearing process.  Rod Wright said that businesses (including Enron) are being frustrated by rules and regs that act as unnecessary impediments. 
 Actually ordering El Paso to do what TW already does, so if anything, affirms TW's operating procedures.  El Paso has been in the cross-hairs of the entire industry.  Interestingly, this suit arose from the lengthy and detailed discussions we all had as part of the settlement---as you can imagine, El Paso saw it as a negative outcome of those talks.  We can discuss further when I'm in Houston tomorrow and Friday.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 10/25/2000 09:40 AM 
 monday--LA w/Karen Denne tuesday--in office wednesday--travel to houston thursday--houston friday--houston 
 FYI:  Got a call from a colleague who told me that Loretta Lynch and Rod Wright, among others, spoke at yesterday's annual meeting of regulation lawyers.  The following sums up what was very briefly relayed to me about Pres. Lynch's and Rod Wright's remarks:  President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---"If you come knocking on my door, that's a strike against you.  One should participate, along with the rest of the public, through the hearing process."  Rod Wright sounded a more positive tone, stating that businesses (including Enron) are being frustrated by rules and regs that act as unnecessary impediments to plant development.  He made the point that the rules and regs need to be made more rationale and streamlined.  Apparently, he's still clinging to the idea of the State getting in to the power plant development business by signing contracts with providers.

 So it is the 2nd after all?  Thought it might be the first, which I could have made.  The 2nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ENA to meet with Sempra execs to see if a deal can be done (yeah, right).  But since it's that early on the 2nd, I can call in by conference call and attend the first 90 minutes, or so.  Will that work?  In other exciting news, going to meet with the lawyers and Bowen either this afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow.  You want to join?  And should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend?  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Sue Nord 10/25/2000 02:15 PM 
 looks fine to me. 
 as you know, prentice is a world class procrastinator---i've been trying to get her to get in touch with steve, larry, ed & co. for about a month to see if they can play on the weekend of dec. 16/17, and she, of course, ain't done it.  by the way, i may have found a really cool "compound" in stinson beach. could you get in touch with those guys and see if they can do it.  sorry to bug you with it, but i think it's best if you guys contact them.  thanks a million.

 thanks a million.  talk to you then.    Lara Leibman@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/31/2000 03:48 PM 
 Greetings Dr. Gobbo:  If my memory serves, you should have arrived back in Italy, or will return soon.  Since we met, I have spoken with Severin Borenstein, who is intimately involved with California's electricity restructuring (melodrama?) and a renowned energy economist  at UC Berkeley.  Severin has offered to serve as a contact for you as you continue to take on the formidable task of restructuring your country's electric industry.  I've included his contact information below.  And, of course, if there is ever anything I can do for you, do not hesitate to contact me.  All the best, Jeff  Severin Borenstein  E.T. Grether Professor of Business Administration and Public Policy   Director Haas School of Business              U.C. Energy Institute University of California             2539 Channing Way Berkeley, CA 94720-1900              Berkeley, CA 94720-5180 (p) 510-642-3689                     (p) 510-642-5145 (f) 707-885-2508                     http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei  Email: borenste@haas.berkeley.edu WWW: http://haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste 
 Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.  Have distributed to Western GA team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.  Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."  Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.  The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.  Comments are much appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Chris:  As we discussed yesterday, Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday.  We'll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S.D. last week.  You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product.  You still considering it?  Let us know and we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.  My flight gets into S.D. at at 8:35 on southwest.  Best, Jeff 
 Sandi sez it's actually happening at 10 AM and it's renewable-focused. 
 Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've misconstrued anything.  Thanks.  FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result. In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a fundamental step in the right direction. However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility in California.  As structured, it will: discourage the development of new generation to serve California fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness. force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California. We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap proposal. We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers. 
 with "much" of what i said?    James D Steffes 11/01/2000 01:39 PM 
 Got calls in to Richard at PG&E and Reed at Sempra.  Will report back.    James D Steffes 11/01/2000 01:28 PM 
 anything you want, honey.  I love you.    Prentice Sellers <psellers@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 11/01/2000 03:15 PM 
 Lord help us.  Call whenever you'd like to discuss the call (that Palmer forgot to tell you about).    David Parquet@ECT 11/01/2000 03:24 PM 
 Thank you.    Mark Palmer 11/01/2000 03:42 PM 
 That's fine if you don't want to do the road, but please tell Eldon and I'll tell Jeff (my road guy). 
 Mark Palmer 11/01/2000 03:42 PM 
 My bet is that Pat will be at NARUC.  I think that Michael Moore, PhD Economist and CEC commissioner would be very good (I tried Bilas--he's got a conflict) and don't think it's a problem that he and Larson are both on because they'll come with two quite different takes.  P.S. FERC dropped a bomb on California today. 
 Apologies.  I'm in S.D. with Calger and Dyer to meet w/Sempra tomorrow morning.    Joseph Alamo 11/01/2000 05:12 PM 
 Will do, thanks.  See you at the Alaska gate.    Christopher F Calger@ECT 11/01/2000 06:02 PM 
 Thanks.  FYI--I'll be participating on the second panel.  Best, Jeff 
 Gee, sounds great.  Can't wait. Congratz on keeping the sky from falling out there.  Best, Jeff    Joe Hartsoe 11/01/2000 05:49 PM 
 Just got back from Sacramento.  Davis still pandering... 
 Nope, not at this point.  Rather than start with money, we'd rather start with getting the rules (i.e., the IOUs) fixed so that there ain't regulatoy roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment.  Sound reasonable? 
 thanks.  let's discuss further.    "Cherry, Brian" <BKC7@pge.com> 11/01/2000 04:46 PM 
 Wanted to make sure that you knew that today FERC declared the cap that the ISO Board voted out last week "null and void," which means that we're back to the old $250 cap.  FERC proposed a "soft" $150 cap that would take effect in 60 days, however.  Call if you have questions.  Best, Jeff 
 My schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling.  Possible to meet this weekend to discuss the project?  Either day's fine with me.  Apologies for the last minute change.  Best, Jeff 
 Is there a suggested time for the meeting?  I'm pretty open.  I'd like to be sure that Jim and Paul and Mary Karen Denne can participate, too.  Do we need to have other commercial folks on the call (e.g., Calger, Belden, someone from EES (Yang and/or Benevides)?    Joseph Alamo 11/03/2000 12:06 PM 
 are you and scott available this weekend to look at the place i'm thinking about renting in stinson for prentice's birthday? 
 thank you very much. 
 Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered on an IEP call today:  The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes. Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on board. Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting. The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous "prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts. Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting. Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do worse, they take the hit.  The utility, under this framework, has broad flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.  (FYI: Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a panel discussion that I participated in yesterday at the California Energy Markets conference.) The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the expertise, to get back into the generation business. 
 I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address. apologies.  i'm losing it.  did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?  If not, do you want to meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?  i'm in town.  just let me know. i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy (flaky) to search it out.  best, Jeff 
 great.  you going to the game?    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/03/2000 01:36 PM 
 that sounds good.  what if it's saturday?  is there a time you could go? (why so much interest in the niner game?    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/03/2000 03:13 PM 
 FYI. 
 11 am it is on saturday.  yes i'm going to see kathy cowlick. 
 Of course, I will be hurt and disappointed if the Sellers family doesn't vote its conscious, doesn't vote for the candidate that truly represents the values that the Sellers family stands for.  That candidate is, of course, Ralph Nadar.  Amen, Jeff  P.S. Rory and Timi love Dr. Laura.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/03/2000 05:07 PM 
 just got a call from the realtor.  they expect us at 11 am at their office in S.B. tomorrow.  lalime's (sp?)  is cool.  ask prentice about it.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/03/2000 04:52 PM 
 don't change the subject.  vote your concious.  gore voted for scalia AND thomas.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/03/2000 05:13 PM 
 one down, four to go.....  god bless scott.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/03/2000 05:42 PM 
 OK.  Looks like Saturday's out.  I'm game for tomorrow.  Morning? Afternoon?  We can meet at my office if you'd like, or at a cafe.  Let me know.  Best, Jeff    Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 11/03/2000 07:26 PM 
 FYI.  My understanding is that Martin and Doug are going to be focused on DG in California.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 11/04/2000 09:53 AM 
 Yes.  You can expect it this weekend.  My apologies for being tardy.  Also, I think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.  I can make a contact and I don't think that it's too late to try.  He'd be very good.  Very close to the governor.    Heather Cameron <hcameron@uclink.berkeley.edu> 11/04/2000 03:54 PM 
 call me unreasonable.  i can take it.  been called worse, though, of course, coming from you, it hurts more. 
 FYI.  We'll get a call in number first think Monday morning.  Paul, do you want to notify Calger, Belden and Thomas in Portland? 
 FYI.  How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the table for some time.  I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to the current framework.  As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy Market conference last week.  The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other options--with him.  My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the Wright meeting last week.  With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.  It might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Harry:  Seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that EES is in the loop.  Assemblyman Rod Wright's trying to find a solution that the whole industry can embrace, which he'd then foist on the Governor.  Sandi, Parquet and Day attended the first meeting last week.  I'll forward to you Parquet's notes from the meeting.  We'll be setting up a call in number first thing Monday morning.  Best, Jeff 
 Congratulations Kathleen and Peter.  This ought to make this week's ARM=20 meeting, well, sort of interesting.=20  Viva New Power!  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is. 
 Given the emphasis from all quarters on the need for retail competition to make California work, would seem useful to strike a balance between the degree to which the comments emphasize wholesale and retail reforms.  And for the record, Sue, no I don't talk like that.  Best, Jeff    Susan J Mara 11/02/2000 03:50 PM 
 Mike:  Call Paul and/or Mona about energy attorneys in Arizona.  (Paul: 503.464.7945.)  Don't give any good talent to our competitors!  Best, Jeff 
 The call-in number for the 12:30 (PST)/2:30 (CST) phone call is:  dial in: 888.476.6127 code: 125995  Thanks, Jeff 
 I don't  we're ready.  could call at some point so we can discuss? 415.782.7822. 
 Reminder we have a call at 3 PM PST/5 PM CST re: CLEC/Tariff in CA/Authority to dig in CA.  We'll use the internal bridge, which I believe is: 888.311.9051 and the code is 60396.  Best, Jeff 
 Have a great time in Nashville.  Don't forget to vote.  Gray gonna be there? 
 We can uninvite steffes, hain, denne, kingerski, comnes if having them on presents any problems.  I hadn't included Marcie on the call, but would be happy to include her, too.  just let me know. 
 Mary: Please include me in the call with Mr. Sanders & Co.  Best, Jeff 
 Ditto.  Sounds good.  Talk to you tonite.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/06/2000 12:58 PM 
 FYI.  I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next Monday on the Berkeley campus.  It's being sponsored by the Policy School and some folks from the Business School.  Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck (Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.  Alums who now work in the energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American Public Power Ass.)  We're providing a modest stipend.  There are two "round tables."  First one is "Why did we do this?," and the second one is "Where to from here?"  I'll be on the second panel.  Go to the attached website for agenda and other info.  I intend to pull from the messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of the last several weeks/months.  I'll distribute talking points for review and comment sometime this week.  But please feel free to send thoughts, suggestions, etc. early and often.  Best, Jeff  http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm. 
 Dear Colleagues,  The draft website is ready to go public. It has been linked to the gspp website. It is still the same address: http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  Talk to you all soon. Best wishes, Heather 
 i'm calling marcie as we speak.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 11/06/2000 02:02 PM 
 FYI:  Sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re: launching missiles over email to the world.  I told her that 1) folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that gets to commercial folks, 2) she should continue sending those notes out and 3) she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to GA, which gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push out to commercial folks, and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an (unintentional and  unnecessary) frenzy.  I think she took it well and I think she'll make a practice.  Only time will tell. 
 Alpert has passed both Assembly and Senate--on way to Governor.  6.5 cent cap.  Am faxing in case you don't have.  Jeff 
 Congratulations.    Joseph Alamo 11/06/2000 03:02 PM 
 Is this something they've said publicly?  If so, have they provided any rationale?  Thanks.    Mary Hain@ECT 11/06/2000 02:36 PM 
 thank you.  if you get a chance, give a jingle and give me the brief rundown on where we left off on part 1.  thanks. 
 Gee, and at $120/bottle, I can load up on a few cases.  At that price, the Mondavi's must be hoping Bush wins so America can spend the tax break on that tasty Reserve.  (Kidding!)  Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve, too?  GO RALPH!      Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/06/2000 01:01 PM 
 another ugly stereotype that is still alive and well in america.  I am so hurt, nancy.  so hurt.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/06/2000 04:52 PM 
 Greetings Wayne:  Sorry that I missed the last meeting.  I'll be attending by phone this week, but would like to attend in person as often as I can (understanding that our meetings will be weekly).  Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.  That way I could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't permit me to do on Wednesdays).  If it's too complicated, don't sweat it; I can continue to do the meetings by phone.  But if Thursdays can fit into folks' schedule, that would be great.  Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.  Best, Jeff 
 Have you drafted any talking points yet?  I'm working on what I'll focus on for the conference at Berkeley next Monday and would love to crib from your comments.  Best, Jeff    Sarah Novosel 11/06/2000 04:58 PM 
 and do you get the discount for the 97 Reserve? 
 I've tried to capture in the document Dave sent around on Friday, the preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting.  If I've mangled or missed anything, please chime in.  If folks have information (i.e., bullet points) to discuss at Wednesday's meeting regarding the various issue areas they're thinking about, please foward along to me by COB tomorrow and I'll compile for distribution first thing Wednesday morning.  Best, Jeff 
 SF all week.    Joseph Alamo 11/06/2000 07:55 PM 
 Do you mind if I meet with Carl and Severin and Rich next time I'm over at Haas to discuss this a bit with them? 
 go right ahead and choose me as a reviewer. 
 Wayne:  If you insist, we can pass on Thanksgiving.  Others:  Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?  If the meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis, I'd like to try to attend in person as much as possible (i.e., schedule permitting).  Currently, my schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.  But Thursdays would work.  If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.  Best, Jeff    Wayne Gardner@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/06/2000 06:08 PM 
 You're welcome. 
 Question:  re: "cat herding."  Do we have the participants list yet?  I've got a call in to Smutney (IEP)---Sue talked to him about the cap yesterday and I'm piling on today.  If we can give Smutney an alternative to "the $150 cap's OK," then we can likely persuade him.  Tim: Be useful to know as soon as possible if the alternative Steve suggests below (i.e., >$150 bids with no disclosure) is palatable.  If other specific CA generators are participating on the panel, we'll need to know who they are in order to "assist" them with their price cap-related comments.  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 11/07/2000 08:59 AM 
 Dave and I talked.  I've talked to Chris Foster (midmarket in Portland). He's sending me 1) illustrative examples of offers we've made to each of the three IOUs, 2) deals we've done with the IOUs to date (only one thus far with PG&E).  Laird Dyer will get back to me with the muni deals we've thus far done (e.g., Roseville.)  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 11/07/2000 08:59 AM 
 Hi.  My palm for some reason isn't syncing.  Could you have Chris give me a call to try to get it to work?  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff  415.782.7822 
 Thanks.  I can be on the call.  One other thing.  If there's anything you need me to do re: Bowen's bill for services, don't hesitate to let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 de nada 
 Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.  In true "swedish hostage syndrome" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the "industry" is under siege and that "just saying no" to price caps isn't politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head of California's generator association to avoid the topic.  We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal and offered the following message points:  Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again. FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether. The most important reforms include: Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to undermine "high" prices is easy entry by competitors Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works. The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" reviews of power purchases. Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish. FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed. Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, efficient markets require peakers. Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary. Disincents energy efficiency. IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap.  Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm sorry, I'm losing my mind.  did you send Amber's address?  if so, i've deleted it. could you send again?  also, are you sure you don't want the tickets?  they come with free parking (it ain't the closest lot, but hey, it saves 20$).  also, please let me know when you've confirmed with the G.O. that you don't want to do road, so that I can tell Jeff.  And of course we'll pick up the football forms, just make sure they're somewhere easy to find (butcher block table?).  we'll be coming up tomorrow evening to pick up all the stuff.  how's the canopy?  you and eldon playing ping pong? 
 Thanks a million.  Will keep you in the loop on what's going on between now and Thursday.  And don't hesitate if you need anything, or if there's anything that you want to add to the stew.    Chris H Foster@ECT 11/07/2000 01:07 PM 
 plz call asap re: dow reporter called to talk ISO peakers.  thx, jeff 415.782.7822 
 plz chk email re: conversation w/smutney on price caps.  best, Jeff 
 To help herd cats, might be useful to get to the generators via multiple contact points.  My understanding is that the Houston-to-Houston contacts are good ones. We'll continue to work it via IEP and generator contacts here in California.

 Steve:  I'm not sure how far along you are with the comments, but California's insistence on micro-managing utility purchases is really standing in the way of developing a competitive, functional market.  The prospect of having Ms. Lynch in particular and the State of California generally as a counter party in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact. (Though the situation in California has now put the utilities into a "damn the torpedoes" mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory risk.)  Clearly, the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function.  But given the political climate in California, we're likely to have the utility in the role of buyer, at least in the near term.  For the market to work in a structure with utility as buyer, the CPUC and California need to get out of the way. Otherwise, it's a never-ending quagmire.  A couple of PUCs ago, the CPUC set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas procurement.  Under that mechanism, a benchmark is set.  If the utility beats the benchmark, it shares the benefits with consumers.  If it does worse than the benchmark, it shares the pain with consumers.  It's a model that works, that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets.  It ain't perfect, but it's head and shoulders above the regulator-as-counterparty that the current PUC has put in place.  Given the brief time you'll have, there may be other more critical issues, but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy.

 Hey, I know it's a pain, but I think there would be value in getting together (if folks are available) on Thursday evening from 7-10 with (lots of) beer and pizza and grind through the finance case.  We can do it at my apartment, or anywhere else you folks would like to do it.  Thoughts?

 Here's a start.  Try 'em out for size.  More to follow.  Best, Jeff  Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again. FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether. The most important reforms include: Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to undermine "high" prices is easy entry by competitors Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works. The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" reviews of power purchases. Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish. FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed. Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, efficient markets require peakers. Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary. Disincents energy efficiency. IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap.

 Couldn't persuade them to stay in D.C.? Ought to be a lot of fun.  Hope all's well with all the craziness out there.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  We'll need to add this to the update.  Hot off the press.  Best, Jeff 
 Can't they stay in D.C.? 
 Good friend of mine's going to Napa to see wineries.  Looking for everyone's favorites to pass along.  Suggestions?

 How can I get info on deals we've done to you?  Jeff 
 Great.  Glad to hear it.  Did you get my voice mail?  Makes sense for you to go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal.  I've talked to folks internally (and will discuss further with them tomorrow and Friday when I'm in Houston).  I'd like you to keep the information confidential, but I'm fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of the project will be.  Best, Jeff

 Hey:  we meeting tonite?  can you BELIEVE this bloody election?    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/07/2000 04:28 PM 
 Steve:  Here are the deals and offers.  The desk is concerned about two things:  1) that we not make the specific of the deals/offers public.  They're fine with general statements like "the offers are below the price cap."  2) they have good relationships with the IOUs and the munis and are starting to do a lot of deal; as such, they expressed concern about any comments that might agitate them and make them disinclined to transact with us (sound familiar)?  If there's anything else you need, for if you have any questions about this material.  Don't hesitate.  Good luck.  Best, Jeff 
 Talked to Bill Reed.  In his comments, he will say:  FERC should be more prescriptive.  Can't wait for a new board, made of new people, to act.  FERC needs to be more assertive--I told him we're all for leadership from FERC. They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him we'd have a similar message on that issue. FERC should "PJM" the California market--I told him we would differ significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and "merging" the PX and the ISO. He said his comments on "refunds" would be "narrow" and would point out that the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific "bad actors" and that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking. I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner. He said that it sounds like a good idea. I told him about our message on price caps.  He said that he would stress that price caps ought to be a temporary "fix," and should be removed just as soon as the market is "functional."  Steve: I told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel tomorrow and talk more.  Best, Jeff  Best, Jeff

 Market Surveillance Committee report is smallest file, oldest doc (August), and probably the best message from our prespective, particularly the solutions.  PX report is the biggest file and the newest (11.1.00). 
 Check email re: talked to Bill Reed; info on deals in CA; ISO/PX docs.  Best, Jeff 
 OK, here's the list:  Mondavi's always a classic, and up the hill is La Famiglia (Mondavi brand that's a sweet view, great place to have a picnic lunch, and it has some neat brique-braque. Hess collection. Sterling. Jarvis--truly amazing (and ostentatious--wait till Beth sees the woman's restroom!) But you must call NOW to try to get in. Cordonui (sparkling wine) also has a very lovely view. Stag's Leap. Up valley (Calistoga way) is Chateau Montellana (sp?), which has really wonderful wine. Finally, if you would like, I might be able to tap into a connection and get you in at Opus (Mondavi--maybe one of the best wines, dare I say, anywhere). Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus, and I'll get on it pronto.  And if you want to do Jarvis, call now!   Hess Collection.  Opus.  Sterling.  Mondavi.  Jarvis (if you can get in). 
 Greetings Folks:  As you know, the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PG&E's trying to figure out where to go from here.  I would argue that what happens with PG&E is equally, if not more, important as what happens with SoCal.  As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts, longs for the "halcyon days" of command-and-control regulation.  As such, I think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.  In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed experts.  I think we should employ that approach again.  I asked Mike Day, who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.  Mike's proposal is attached.  Finally, if there's anyone else you think we ought to include in our coalition, please let me know.  Let me know what you think.  Hope all is well with you and yours.  Best, Jeff  ***************************************************************************      Jeff:  Goodin, MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements.  We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition.  In exchange for joining the coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information.  I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc. However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead partner on the case.  I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case.  Because the majority of this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly fees.  However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition, and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all participants in the coalition.  With this discount, these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.  I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be.  Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates.  If you require some type of estimation sooner than that, please let me know.  Thank you for your interest in using our services.

 Thanks.  Will do.  It's going to be a long haul. 
 Hi.  Nice to see you in Houston.  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points you circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the talk?  Finally, rest assured, you're the best resource anyone could hope for on gas issues anywhere in Enron.  If it seems like I've bugged you less recently it's because 1) I feel like I've bugged you a lot--too much--over the past couple of years and don't want to wear out my welcome and 2) with the electricity crisis in California and the start-up of Broadband, my attention has been less focused on gas.  Though that will change soon, since as you may have heard, PG&E's "Gas Accord" is coming to an end and we've got to figure out where to go from here.  (You'll be hearing from me in the near future on that issue, since I'll need to get a company-wide view of what we want to happen out here in the West.)  Look forward to seeing you again real soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  How you feeling these days?  From whom can I get copies of the following presentations?  2000 RB-NGC-0800-2 2000 JN-2080039-4  Thanks a billion. 
 thanks very much.  can you email me a copy of the OII?  let's get together for coffee sometime and discuss things.    "Cherry, Brian" <BKC7@pge.com> 11/07/2000 06:59 PM 
 Thanks.  Wow, can you believe only a week?  (I bet you can.)  I'll be thinking of you.  Best of luck.  Will miss you while you're out. 
 Thanks.  FYI:  I won't need accomodations.  I'll only be there for the day on Tuesday. 
 I've got an idea.  Howzabout Ted cooks and you clean up?  Seriously, though, I'll try to host next time at my humble apartment.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/09/2000 01:31 PM 
 Greetings Ms Carson:  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points that Shelly Corman circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the talk?  And are there any recent analyses by CERA, PIRA etc. about gas nationally, in the West, and in California that you could forward.  And if you get a chance, could you give a ring?  I've got a couple of questions.  As always, greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 gracias, jose. 
 I assume, since C1's stock rose 10 points yesterday, that you struck a deal with them! 
 you @ ferc?  if so, give kahn my best, and tell him we look forward to the flood of plants he'll approve next week.  peace will never change.  Jeff 
 you hearing this horseshit?  jeff 
 for the "JN" presentation, could you send me the one that Gil Muhl gave? Thanks a bunch. 
 the hard copy i have (it's from the "media binder" developed for our offsite at the Woodlands on 9.19.00) has the number JN-2080039.  it's from gil's presentation to the AGA on 9.19.00.  Thank, Jeff      Simon Shih 11/09/2000 02:21 PM

 Hi Ginger:  Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on Monday.  I'll be participating in the conference.  Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless)  "UC Regents" and send it to:  Heather Cameron Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy University of California 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA  94720   The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is:  946002123.  Thanks very much.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 So far, all is well.  Thanks for asking.  Best, Jeff 
 Mark: Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation.  Perhaps the administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a "placeholder" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to "fix" the mess that California refers to as a "market."  As such, there hasn't been much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control regulation.  However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports, which I'll forward in a seperate email.  I look forward to seeing Prof. Littlechild at the conference on Monday.  He's on the first panel, I'm on the second.  I've attached the URL for info on the conference.   http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  December 2000 HEADLINE: "Perfection in California" AUTHOR: Wilfred Wong SUMMARY: Recommended: 1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130) 
 darling.  please.  don't taunt me.  i'm now too flustered for words.  got your page and voicemail.  been wrapped up ALL day.  i'll try to call later.  give me your number again, please.    Colleen Silva <Csilva@redsky.com> 11/09/2000 03:34 PM

 FYI. 
 OK, the tours are booked (it ain't much anyway).  But you're on the guest list for a complimentary OPUS tasting (see previous note).  OPUS is across the street from and just south of the main Mondavi winery.  When you get there, check in with the concierge, who will have your name and will set up with the complimentary tasting.  It gets real crowded sometimes, which causes them to close the gates.  If that occurs, you simply need to buzz the intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up.  You should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a cool place.  Finally, they're open from 10:30-3:30.  Later it gets, crazier it gets.  I suggest you try to get there around 11:30, which will ensure that you get the attention you deserve.  Have a great time.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Greetings. I really encourage you folks to be in close contact with Robbi and company.  Please keep me tightly in the loop about any conversations, activities, etc.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Hopefully you mean "buy?" 
 John:  I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting. Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.  I apologize---you may have read in the papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.  It's taking up a considerable amount of my time these days.  I would be happy to reschedule for next week.  Wed-Fri.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 John:  We must thinking alike.  I just sent you a note.  I apologize, but I need to reschedule.  Monday and Tuesday of next week don't work, but Wed. thru Thurs. do.  Just let me know what works for you.  Again, my apologies, and I look forward to meeting next week.  Best, Jeff 
 Monday--Morning office; Afternoon--UC Berkeley participating in roundtable on California electricity crisis Tuesday--AB 1890 implementation group--presentation on gas issues in California Wed--In office Thurs--in office Fri--in office 
 Greetings:  Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC hearing that took place today.  We've been invited to attend.  Focus of hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather than FERC's.  Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.  Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California? Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee? ("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell group of people.")  If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST). Please let me know if this works for folks.  And if it does work, Ginger could you set up a call-in number?  Best, Jeff 
 This schedule is correct. 
 you're very welcome. 
 Greetings Diane:  Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying!  In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the head, I just wanted to say it's been great working with  you guys. Unbelievable....   In any case, congratulations.  Sounds like, all in all, it was a good meeting.   Scott:  has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet? 
 Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody.  Amen. 
 You have access to generation daily?  Just wondering if the guy wrote the story... 
 the feeling is quite mutual.  best, jeff    Donald Lassere@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/10/2000 12:08 PM 
 I apologize if I offended anyone.  Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large, regulated utility in  California.  Thanks for attributing the quote to me.  You did a great job at the hearing----it went decidely downhill after you left.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you for the note.  I'm very much looking forward to meeting you, and hope that you can visit the office while your hear to discuss California. How long will you be visiting?  Best, Jeff    "Stephen Littlechild" <littlechild@tanworth.mercianet.co.uk> 11/10/2000 12:27 PM

 Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday. If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL: http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"  I've been asked to identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).  There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10 meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the "facilitator."  All comments are appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 You coming diving with me and Shea tomorrow?  You gotta do it, man.

 Greetings.  Lately, my email's been mangling addresses when I reply.  Just noticed that I got alot of "couldn't send/big error" messages from the answers I emailed out late last nite.  Did anyone get them?  I'm trying again.  Please let me know if you get this one.  Thanks, and sorry about the mixup.  Best, Jeff 
 That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her. In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll look into setting up a meeting with her.  Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the "undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move ahead.  Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control Peace at her hearings.

 Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be there in person.   Thoughts?

 Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing something, please let me know.  Thoughts?    Harry Kingerski 11/13/2000 08:45 AM 
 plz call. re: phil harris of PJM is on my panel today.  want to discuss. 415.782.7822.  thx, jeff 
 Keep in mind that there will be 3 Davis appointees come the first of the year.  Right now the Wilson, Republican commissioners, still hold a 3-2 majority on the Commission.    Mona L Petrochko 11/13/2000 11:40 AM 
 My apologies.  Thank you very much.  Best, Jeff    Diane Dimeff <dimeff@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 11/13/2000 12:14 PM 
 We said no. 
 sunday. 
 If Karen thinks it would be useful to have the PR firm go and report back, that's how we'll handle it.  Otherwise, we'll get reports from others.  Other commitments win out over FERC's "open mike."    Susan J Mara 11/13/2000 12:28 PM 
 Welcome Chris.  I can meet during the break. 
 Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday. Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far as to push the "core/noncore" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:  I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act as a "quasi-governmental" body offering reliable, low cost service to small customers. I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive market willy nilly. People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of the "good" power, leaving the "dregs" for small customers.  While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening that we should try to exploit.  In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the utility live or die by the benchmark.  There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the Legislature will get on board.

 Can we try Friday at 10 am, again?    John Protzel <John.Protzel@Cambira.com> 11/13/2000 05:58 PM 
 As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to. Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)

 Sorry that I've been incommunicado.  At the UC Berkeley conference yesterday, and on my way to an AB 1890 meeting to present on gas in about 5 minutes. Got your message re: PR firm.  Sounds good.  When I'm back in tomorrow, I'll fill you in on yesterday's conference and today's meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Dub and I are going to go to Stinson/Bolinas to seela the deal on Saturday morning/afternoon prior to going to Napa for Nancy's Bday on Sat night. Would love to have you two join, but worry not if you've got conflicts.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Sorry to bother you with this, but I'm travelling, and if you could leave the call-in number for tomorrow's meeting on my voice mail, I'll be forever indebted.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you very much for the summary. 
 Man, Illinois is tough.  One has to submit testimony to get certified!  How are things going?  Got your voice mail.  Hope all's well.  Recovered yet from the conventions? 
 call in number? 
 Glad to hear you're coming.  I'll be sure to wear the lime green shirt....  Best, Jeff    Richard Shapiro 11/14/2000 07:34 PM 
 See you then. 
 B.O. Sorry, I was out of the office all day.  Hope you got there.    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 11/14/2000 02:38 PM 
 I don't have any number.  You need to just drop by there and buzz the manager.  Try from 8-5, when someone's usually there.  Sorry, babe.    Colleen Silva <Csilva@redsky.com> 11/14/2000 03:41 PM

 Love to join.  Thanks. 
 FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed electricity model created by AB 1980.
