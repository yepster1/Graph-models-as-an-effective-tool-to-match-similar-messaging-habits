Gouger Gray Davis=20 California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electrici= ty  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the Sa= n=20 Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit= h=20 regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nic= e=20 publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been=20 unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this=20 optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th= at=20 out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha= s=20 been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20 generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th= is=20 amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee= n=20 state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's= =20 chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug= e=20 overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20 generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20 perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the= =20 state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20 where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."= =20 Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin= g=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and= =20 the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked= =20 for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,= =20 Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20 "melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20 Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20 released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power=20 companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the=20 average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.= =20 California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles= =20 Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District= =20 (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state= =20 generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping= =20 boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33= 0=20 per megawatt hour.=20 Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20 spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators= =20 who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that= =20 are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off= =20 by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."=20 Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i= t=20 turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business=20 consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion = in=20 ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The= =20 state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the= =20 current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state= =20 power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high price= s=20 are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set t= o=20 eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper powe= r.=20 Who's the real gouger?

Gray Davis has begged= ,=20 cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo= rk=20 for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin= g=20 its lights on.=20 Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti= ve=20 investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20 battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc= e=20 back from a rocky start.=20 This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20 scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which= =20 would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed= ,=20 Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political= =20 infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t= o=20 satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti= er=20 investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20 without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial= =20 headaches for decades to come.=20 "This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20 Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."= =20 That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and= =20 credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb= t=20 investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a= s=20 long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers= =20 from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.= =20 Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will= =20 be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20 private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20 Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20 succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20 originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy= =20 crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult.

"The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20 education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20 California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --= =20 stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,= =20 the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow= er=20 plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore= d=20 power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20 The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20 soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.= =20 Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from = $7=20 billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20 billion.=20 With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and= =20 Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20 dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business= =20 with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow= ed=20 the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from= =20 public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, = at=20 a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20 In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a= =20 bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20 continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size= =20 of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula= =20 would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20 Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20 another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to= =20 $13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake= rs=20 banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to= =20 immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20 mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20 In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving= =20 four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine= d=20 a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi= ng=20 moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.= =20 At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow= n"=20 their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin= g=20 a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou= p=20 Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t= o=20 charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20 issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $= 56=20 million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees= =20 won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20 structure.=20 From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem= ed=20 fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to= =20 explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h= is=20 blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi= s=20 only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's= =20 Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes= =20 before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th= e=20 state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20 During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20 conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20 director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not= =20 getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20 "It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, = a=20 Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't= =20 recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A= =20 spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20 Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20 investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike= =20 system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.= =20 But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20 Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers= ,=20 turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response= =20 to one of his answers.=20 Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f= or=20 example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20 Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless= =20 it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by= =20 February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20 claims "completely" political.=20 California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger= =20 pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,= =20 "and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors= =20 know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby= =20 added.=20 Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the= =20 Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20 former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc= e=20 calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th= at=20 California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that= =20 "the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few= =20 months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc= .=20 Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t= o=20 make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue= =20 set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,= =20 the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20 purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20 raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20 decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20 utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20 consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice= =20 directly from generators or traders.=20 But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh= t.=20 Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might= =20 get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU= C=20 decision before the state Supreme Court.=20 California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.= =20 Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p= er=20 kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares= =20 with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag= o,=20 but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20 High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy= =20 electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to=20 eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price o= f=20 electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," say= s=20 Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20 The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr= a=20 Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest= =20 possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20 example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai= m=20 that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20 utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai= ls=20 and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20 Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th= at=20 could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face=20 another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power=20 contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved= =20 get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who= =20 are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20 In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i= s=20 expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal=20 issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president = of=20 Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20 individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to= =20 participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. = "I=20 don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds.=20 Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20 energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were goin= g=20 south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems,"= =20 says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in= =20 San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also= =20 worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20 To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20 billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure= =20 that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments= =20 in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20 through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues= =20 from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the= =20 bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of=20 Standard & Poor's state and local government group.=20 It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrul= e=20 state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge cou= ld=20 rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's=20 creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a= =20 wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if = it=20 ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection.=20 Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by=20 chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors.

Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio= n=20 long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20 energy market. Here's the real story:=20 Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state= =20 generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.= =20 This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November= ,=20 it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati= on=20 gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ= y=20 purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20 billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state= =20 budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass= =20 the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to= =20 issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20 In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout= s=20 rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia= te=20 long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20 long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at= =20 the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The= =20 cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug= e=20 glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20 construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20 resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate= =20 the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of= =20 three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in= =20 the long-term energy contracts.=20 To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse= s.=20 Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20 redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20 bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract= s=20 that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly= =20 objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of= =20 environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the= =20 generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b= y=20 the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over= =20 the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20 Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our= =20 energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer= =20 has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20 recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20 Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20 cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20 The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California= =20 still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity= =20 costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20 businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th= e=20 state's economic growth.=20 There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is t= o=20 have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the= =20 Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making=20 authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.      Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20 By Rebecca Smith  07/31/2001=20 The Wall Street Journal=20 Page A3=20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20 Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means= =20 that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost= =20 of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20 Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20 equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20 contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile= =20 and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe= r,=20 and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric= e=20 it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio= n=20 to $35 million.=20 The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,= =20 the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20 electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing= =20 business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned= =20 utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since= =20 then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much = as=20 20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it= =20 was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20 Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month= =20 of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you= 'd=20 expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"= =20 said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20 Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on= =20 average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for= =20 some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an= d=20 $148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas= ed=20 under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20 excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27= =20 per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t= he=20 DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20 This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat= e=20 was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at= =20 times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly= =20 power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20 obligations.=20 Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow= n=20 substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 = by=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20 factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International= ,=20 sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting= =20 energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20 Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average= =20 cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i= s=20 more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices= =20 averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen= cy=20 $1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the= =20 huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is= =20 pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i= ts=20 coffers.=20 The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed = by=20 federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.= =20 So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3= 6=20 billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20 purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20 But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, ha= s=20 at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last=20 Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per= =20 megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot=20 market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the= =20 actual shape of demand.=20 John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a= =20 big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his= =20 company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resource= s=20 agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to= =20 resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what= =20 the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout= .=20 (Chart)

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt =20   \ objattph=20 Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose= =20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterd= ay=20 denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up= =20 during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundre= ds=20 of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra=20 Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted= =20 those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to = be=20 owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are= =20 completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E= .=20 The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio= n=20 debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa= n=20 Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20 selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is= =20 that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20 SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20 actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher= =20 price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t= o=20 over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20 earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while= =20 publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham= es=20 said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20 detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state= =20 Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20 SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20 consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa= ny=20 had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was= =20 required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20 marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh= at=20 we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20 along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20 publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the= =20 Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,= =20 SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates= =20 during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal= =20 terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici= ty=20 to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold= =20 that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20 pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr= om=20 the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and= =20 billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici= ty=20 exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,= =20 it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20 million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with= =20 its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because= =20 the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's=20 shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses= =20 entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities= =20 Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,= =20 when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual=20 power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the= =20 commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra= =20 reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt= .=20 The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling a= nd=20 award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from= =20 selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession= =20 because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says= =20 the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocate= s=20 agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Se= n.=20 Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the= =20 balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and= =20 that's something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the=20 balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of= =20 the gains we've already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis= =20 did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations. = =20 Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists= =20 demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager= =20 for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG= &E=20 has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission=20 rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the= =20 scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they= =20 were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to= =20 split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from= =20 sales,' is disingenuous."

"It (the application) is ver= y=20 detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort=20 before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in= =20 the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20 partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ= ia=20 Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take= =20 three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20 industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the= =20 idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20 plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and= =20 the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest= =20 median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to se= e=20 what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with= =20 Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with m= e=20 I've been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant= =20 would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The compa= ny=20 also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapo= r=20 plume such as the one produced by the city's Iceoplex generating plant.  Th= e=20 plant and park are slated for Quail Hills, the last large parcel of vacant= =20 industrial land in the city.

In a= =20 related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Mond= ay=20 that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary=20 inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the= =20 energy stocks.

Lehane issued a statement through= =20 the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge= =20 the controller in court."

GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry. By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS  July 31 2001  The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry= =20 into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20 information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat= e,=20 a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.  The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20 response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20 Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants= =20 may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20 information not available to the public.  On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be= en=20 fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a= nd=20 their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20 capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20 about who in the administration owns energy stocks.  Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20 Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company= =20 he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h= as=20 been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20 Enron Corp. in 1996.  "It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.  He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20 largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.  Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's= =20 mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th= e=20 governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio= n=20 was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a= =20 value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.  "I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he= =20 purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available= =20 information.  The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms= =20 that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20 California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy= =20 merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.  The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from= =20 several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.  Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20 Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held= =20 between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of= =20 multimillion-dollar price gouging.  In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte= r=20 he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were= =20 supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20 failed to do so.  In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20 governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.  "The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20 conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20 activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said= =20 Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.  Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20 governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and= =20 broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20 crisis.  In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur= e=20 documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two= =20 energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20 possibility of insider trading.  State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the= ir=20 personal financial interests.  The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,= =20 delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not= =20 clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the= =20 agency's review would result in any charges.  Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by= =20 federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider= =20 trading.  But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his= =20 colleagues owned Calpine stock.  Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende= d=20 it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20 now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20 traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.  Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20 March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow= er=20 for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders= =20 Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20 their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to = be=20 filed only two weeks ago.  "But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,= =20 because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20 hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."  Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two= =20 weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20 securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor= e=20 leaving her state job.  Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i= n=20 individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto= ck=20 Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a= =20 good investment.  "I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.= =20 "We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."  As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20 state, but only at market prices.  Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi= s=20 image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,= =20 have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court= =20 settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.  Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said= =20 the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for= =20 communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.  "Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.= =20 Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor= ,=20 to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20 consulting business with the governor."  As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20 Monday morning.  Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle= en=20 Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus= e=20 of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20 financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro= m=20 Davis and the Legislature.

Gouger Gray Davis=20 California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electrici= ty  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the Sa= n=20 Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit= h=20 regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nic= e=20 publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been=20 unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this=20 optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th= at=20 out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha= s=20 been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20 generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th= is=20 amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee= n=20 state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's= =20 chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug= e=20 overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20 generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20 perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the= =20 state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20 where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."= =20 Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin= g=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and= =20 the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked= =20 for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,= =20 Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20 "melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20 Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20 released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power=20 companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the=20 average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.= =20 California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles= =20 Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District= =20 (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state= =20 generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping= =20 boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33= 0=20 per megawatt hour.=20 Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20 spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators= =20 who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that= =20 are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off= =20 by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."=20 Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i= t=20 turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business=20 consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion = in=20 ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The= =20 state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the= =20 current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state= =20 power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high price= s=20 are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set t= o=20 eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper powe= r.=20 Who's the real gouger?

Gray Davis has begged= ,=20 cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo= rk=20 for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin= g=20 its lights on.=20 Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti= ve=20 investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20 battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc= e=20 back from a rocky start.=20 This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20 scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which= =20 would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed= ,=20 Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political= =20 infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t= o=20 satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti= er=20 investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20 without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial= =20 headaches for decades to come.=20 "This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20 Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."= =20 That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and= =20 credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb= t=20 investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a= s=20 long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers= =20 from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.= =20 Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will= =20 be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20 private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20 Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20 succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20 originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy= =20 crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th= e=20 price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ= er=20 in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission= =20 to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin= g=20 blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20 Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies= =20 are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20 disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System= =20 and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor= s=20 Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently= =20 as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three= =20 months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court=20 protection.=20 By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early Novembe= r,=20 the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a tot= al=20 of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond= =20 issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops,=20 California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts,=20 raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past ye= ar=20 to pay back what it owes.=20 If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble,"= =20 says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20 education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20 California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --= =20 stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,= =20 the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow= er=20 plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore= d=20 power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20 The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20 soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.= =20 Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from = $7=20 billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20 billion.=20 With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and= =20 Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20 dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business= =20 with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow= ed=20 the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from= =20 public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, = at=20 a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20 In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a= =20 bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20 continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size= =20 of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula= =20 would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20 Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20 another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to= =20 $13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake= rs=20 banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to= =20 immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20 mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20 In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving= =20 four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine= d=20 a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi= ng=20 moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.= =20 At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow= n"=20 their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin= g=20 a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou= p=20 Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t= o=20 charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20 issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $= 56=20 million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees= =20 won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20 structure.=20 From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem= ed=20 fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to= =20 explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h= is=20 blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi= s=20 only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's= =20 Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes= =20 before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th= e=20 state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20 During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20 conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20 director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not= =20 getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20 "It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, = a=20 Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't= =20 recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A= =20 spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20 Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20 investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike= =20 system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.= =20 But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20 Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers= ,=20 turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response= =20 to one of his answers.=20 Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f= or=20 example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20 Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless= =20 it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by= =20 February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20 claims "completely" political.=20 California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger= =20 pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,= =20 "and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors= =20 know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby= =20 added.=20 Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the= =20 Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20 former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc= e=20 calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th= at=20 California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that= =20 "the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few= =20 months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc= .=20 Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t= o=20 make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue= =20 set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,= =20 the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20 purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20 raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20 decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20 utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20 consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice= =20 directly from generators or traders.=20 But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh= t.=20 Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might= =20 get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU= C=20 decision before the state Supreme Court.=20 California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.= =20 Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p= er=20 kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares= =20 with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag= o,=20 but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20 High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy= =20 electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to=20 eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price o= f=20 electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," say= s=20 Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20 The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr= a=20 Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest= =20 possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20 example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai= m=20 that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20 utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai= ls=20 and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20 Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th= at=20 could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face=20 another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power=20 contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved= =20 get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who= =20 are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20 In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i= s=20 expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal=20 issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president = of=20 Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20 individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to= =20 participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. = "I=20 don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds.=20 Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20 energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were goin= g=20 south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems,"= =20 says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in= =20 San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also= =20 worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20 To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20 billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure= =20 that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments= =20 in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20 through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues= =20 from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the= =20 bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of=20 Standard & Poor's state and local government group.=20 It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrul= e=20 state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge cou= ld=20 rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's=20 creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a= =20 wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if = it=20 ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection.=20 Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by=20 chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors.

Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio= n=20 long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20 energy market. Here's the real story:=20 Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state= =20 generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.= =20 This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November= ,=20 it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati= on=20 gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ= y=20 purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20 billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state= =20 budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass= =20 the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to= =20 issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20 In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout= s=20 rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia= te=20 long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20 long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at= =20 the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The= =20 cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug= e=20 glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20 construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20 resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate= =20 the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of= =20 three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in= =20 the long-term energy contracts.=20 To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse= s.=20 Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20 redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20 bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract= s=20 that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly= =20 objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of= =20 environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the= =20 generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b= y=20 the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over= =20 the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20 Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our= =20 energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer= =20 has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20 recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20 Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20 cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20 The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California= =20 still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity= =20 costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20 businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th= e=20 state's economic growth.=20 There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake.

Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20 By Rebecca Smith  07/31/2001=20 The Wall Street Journal=20 Page A3=20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20 Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means= =20 that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost= =20 of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20 Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20 equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20 contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile= =20 and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe= r,=20 and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric= e=20 it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio= n=20 to $35 million.=20 The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,= =20 the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20 electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing= =20 business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned= =20 utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since= =20 then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much = as=20 20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it= =20 was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20 Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month= =20 of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you= 'd=20 expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"= =20 said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20 Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on= =20 average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for= =20 some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an= d=20 $148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas= ed=20 under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20 excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27= =20 per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t= he=20 DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20 This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat= e=20 was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at= =20 times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly= =20 power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20 obligations.=20 Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow= n=20 substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 = by=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20 factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International= ,=20 sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting= =20 energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20 Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average= =20 cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i= s=20 more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices= =20 averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen= cy=20 $1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the= =20 huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is= =20 pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i= ts=20 coffers.=20 The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed = by=20 federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.= =20 So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3= 6=20 billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20 purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20 But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, ha= s=20 at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last=20 Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per= =20 megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot=20 market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the= =20 actual shape of demand.=20 John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a= =20 big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his= =20 company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resource= s=20 agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to= =20 resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what= =20 the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout= .=20 (Chart)

 Hi Mike: Parquet found me to talk about the QF ideas that you guys are bouncing around.  I'll be in Portland tomorrow.  You have some time to sit and discuss a bit?  Best, Jeff 
 thanks lara.

 PS--I'm trying hard (but failing) to shift the blame for our stock drop away from the bozos running California to the wacky broadband market.  Any help you two can provide would be greatly appreciated.  PPS---It's Ms Mona's birthday today.  Hope to see you both real soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Today Mona and I attended a meeting of the "California Energy Solutions Group" (formerly the AB 1890 Implementation Group).  But for the issues discussed below, there's not much else to report from the meeting other than folks engaged in a good deal of posturing.  At our urging, the group decided to form a "subcommittee" comprised of a subset of the group.  The group will work quickly to develop a "strawperson" proposal to present to the larger group for consideration.  The goal is to quickly arrive at a "settlement"---ideally by year end, or sooner---that everyone can agree to and offer up to Davis, legislators, etc.  Our "reward" for coming up with the idea is the requirement that we serve on the "committee."  In addition to us, the other people on the committee are:  Eve Elsesser will chair the committee---Cogen types John Fielder---Edison Mike Florio--TURN Bill Booth---CLECA Carolyn McIntyre---Sempra Smutney--Generators Aaron Thomas--AES (retail) Tony Braun--Munis Ralph Cavanagh--NRDC John Flory--CALPX  It is clear that one of the key issues is devising the "benchmark" that the CPUC can use to judge the reasonableness of utility purchases---similar to the model used for utility procurement on the gas side.  Chris Calger is in the office working on the power plant deals and I briefly discussed with him ways of devising a politically palatable, commercially defensible benchmark. We came up with some ideas that he suggested I pursue further with Bob Badeer, Chris Foster and Tim Belden, which I'll do on Monday.   The first meeting of the subcommittee is on Tuesday.  If possible, I'd like to add the "benchmark" and "committee" issues to our agenda for Tuesday's meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Howzabout 11 AM?    Michael Etringer/ENRON@enronXgate 07/31/2001 03:58 PM 
 Sounds good.  See you at 11.  Best, Jeff    Michael Etringer/ENRON@enronXgate 07/31/2001 04:26 PM 
 Bear with me.  I want to work on it through the evening.  Will make sure that it's out tonite, well in advance of tomorrow's 1 PM PDT conference call.  Best, Jeff 
 please print out as overheads:  pages 1 (cover page), 5, and 6.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Got 'em.  Thanks a million.    Karen Denne/ENRON@enronXgate 07/31/2001 05:25 PM 
 I've just been informed that I'm being switched to Outlook tonite, which means, I've been told, that I may not have access to my email later this evening.  If that holds, I'll email the draft to everyone first thing in the morning (hopefully by 8 AM Houston) time.  Otherwise, it'll land in your email later tonite.  My apologies for all the machinations.  Best, Jeff 
 Man, there must be a lot of bad hair out your way with that kind of heat. 
 Thanks, Mike.  I prefer the $15,000/clean slate option.  For comments on the proposed decision and lobbying on this specific case, I'm willing to go straight hourly basis, but I will continue to request fixed prices going foward.  And worry not, it's not a Rick, Paul, Steffes issue.  I'm the headache.  All this said, and budget haggling aside, I'm sure you're aware that it's my view that 1) you do fantastic work and 2) it's great to work with you.  Best, Jeff    MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> 10/10/2000 12:14 PM 
 i have a finance midterm and will be at your place around 10 or 10:15, most likely.  be happy to chat.  i can't believe those fins.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 10/24/2000 11:47 AM 
 Greetings:  We are getting considerable traction with the idea of using a "benchmark" to judge utility purchases, similar in concept to what's in place on the gas side.  To oversimplify it:  1) set the benchmark 2) the utility buys for consumers and tries to beat the benchmark 3) if (at the end of the year) the utility has beat the benchmark, it shares the profits with consumers; if the benchmark wins, the utility shares the losses with consumers 4) the PUC performs no "after-the-fact" reasonableness; no "second-guessing"  California likes the idea and is now looking to Enron to come up with what the benchmark ought to be.  I talked to Calger a bit about it today and he suggested that I get together with you guys.  As always, time's short. Are you available on Monday?  Thanks, Jeff 
 She was at attention, throughout the meeting..... 
 Thanks very much, Doug. 
 Apologies.  I've had to focus a bit on the finance project (and slogging through the case has been long and painful).  I'll have my responses to 1-3 to Kim later this afternoon. 
 I didn't get an email on German GAAP from the professor. 
 Here's the exec sum draft that distributed hard copies of today.  it's going to change quite a bit based on today's work.  i'll try to turn it around by tomorrow for folks to look at. 
 well? 
 Ditto, Christine:  I've proposed some edits (for what they're worth) to Christine's fine work.  Kim, this case has left me brain dead ("compare the differences between the US Consitutation and the Magna Carta"---give me a break), so you may want to make sure that I haven't made any outrageous typos.  Best, Jeff      Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 12/03/2000 10:37 PM 
 Greetings.  I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference calling beginning at 2 pm.  Is that possible.  If not, no big deal.  I, like Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between now and then.  Let me know.  And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on the most urgent issues.  Best, Jeff    RCavanagh@nrdc.org (Ralph Cavanagh) 12/03/2000 07:30 PM 
 Very glad to here that things have gone well thus far.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the good luck continues!  If we don't talk between now and Thursday, we'll talk then.  Best, Jeff 
 Not sure that you were on the email list for this.  Who's "Chris Fair?"  I don't think that's you. 
 Great.  How's 2 PM today? 
 T&J:  I think at this point, any more changes, and we're going to blow our collective brains out.  But here's a question.  What interest rate did we use to calculate the interest the County receives on its "ending balance?"  Ted, you likely have a much better feel for this, but should it be something like the 3-month commercial paper rate, or something?  Did we use the 20-year treasury?  Again, I think we likely ought leave the thing along at this point, but thought I'd throw it out there.  Tell me that it doesn't matter, please.  And Ted, I thought we agreed that the interest rate was 5.720928373983039 (kidding).  Jackie:  Good luck with Schwab.  I'll keep my fingers and toes crossed.  Best, Jeff 
 I agree.  My expectations for the new "California Energy Solutions Group" are low, but willing to give it a go.  I'm planning on having the piece done by lunch---working on it now.  Attached is the first message;  there are 3 more messages, or so, which will only be (no more than) one more page. 
 New Yorker reviews Henry Moss in this week's issue.  Haven't read it yet. Did you guys like it?  Cameron, what's the name of the bandwidth exchange firm that you guys did your deal with?  Bandwidth Exchange?  (I"m brain dead.) 
 Got your message re: reverse auction all of the utility's demand.  Getting (interestingly complicated), though.  Now, the utilities want to create a "core/noncore" split in electricity, like in gas  (where large gas customers can't take commodity from the utility).  With a core/noncore split, Edison claims that QF contracts, nukes and other existing generation that it still holds is sufficient to meet "core" needs and it therefore may not need "contracts."  As you can imagine, large customers ain't clamoring to get thrown into the market as "noncore" customers right about now.  But they may find themselves without a choice.  I talked to Calger on Friday about reverse auction versus benchmark and I'll be talking to the traders about it this afternoon, and we'll be discussing further when Rick, Steffes et al are here tomorrow.  Will let you know where it goes.  Best, Jeff 
 Talk to you then. 
 Sorry to bring it up again, but did we finally give up on UC/CSU?  Jessie Knight called me.  He's now the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce is S.D.  They plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in S.D. that the best thing to leave Sempra and switch to another provider.  ("Do you want the Legislature to manage your energy costs, or do you want to manage them yourself?")  They want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well they're doing.  Ray McNally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic Enron customer and is going to contact the Chamber.  Be useful to have a business or two, or, UC/CSU.  Know it's a long shot, but figured it don't hurt to try. 
 Hi Michelle:  Guess who?  Just went into Ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez that I'm entitled to 75 hours of vacation, and that I've used 48 hours, leaving 27.  I think that I'm actually entitled to more than 75 hours. Please tell me that I am.  Thanks very much.  Signed, Desperately in need of vacation  Also, I clicked on deferral enrollment, and by-golly if I couldn't find the election form to download.  Am I just clueless, or is there another place that I need to look for it?  Thanks a million. 
 Sounds good.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 12/04/2000 12:57 PM 
 thanks.  we should talk more about the perfect deal----if it's still something that you think is worth pursuing.  you didn't think henry moss was the cat's meow, did you? 
 I think that you're wondering is right on target.    "Pocta, Robert M." <rmp@cpuc.ca.gov> 12/04/2000 02:14 PM 
 Hi:  Though I'll miss the meeting (if it's over by 2 PM), I'll be able to give you our ideas on the agenda items tomorrow.  If there's anything else, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Please keep this confidential at this point.  It's the agenda for the California "subcommittee" meeting on Tuesday that I mentioned in an earlier note.  They were unable to reschedule the meeting, which starts at 10 AM tomorrow, but we're on the subcommitte and  will have very good access to the final product, so I'm not too concerned about missing the "kickoff" meeting. Folks in California are really looking to us to help figure out item #2 "forward contracting."  It would be very useful to discuss this outline tomorrow while we're all together.  Best, Jeff 
 good point.  if you'd like to include it in this draft, i'm fine with that---we certainly have been very vocal about the need to reform it. alternatively, we could discuss with the larger group tomorrow whether we weigh in heavily and if so what our exact message ought to be.  either way works for me, just let me know. 
 thanks.  my assumption is that, with respect to power plant siting and what we ought to do, you'll take the lead tomorrow.  does it make sense for now to leave a "placeholder' under that one and we can discuss further tomorrow, or would you prefer to put a specific item in there now, like "Legislature should revisit last session's streamlining bill?"    Sandra McCubbin 12/04/2000 03:15 PM 
 you're cash flow spreadsheet is freakin' awesome.  nice job. 
 plz call 415.782.7822.  jeff 
 can you please call me?  i'm trying to input the numbers from the spreadsheet into the exec sum, and have a question.  thanks.  415.782.7822. 
 Thank you so much.  Really sorry to bother you so much.    Michelle Hargrave@ECT 12/04/2000 04:19 PM 
 Just had a long internal meeting.  Over the next 24 hours, we're going to try to simulate on California a potential solution we devised in the meeting.  No sense in offering something up if we don't know what the numbers look like, at least in a "ball park" sense.   I should be able to get you something fairly concrete by end of day tomorrow or first thing Wednesday.  That work? Have fun tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 That sounds like a very reasonable way to proceed.    Evelyn Kahl Elsesser <eke@aelaw.com> 12/04/2000 05:39 PM 
 Attached is a very rough draft of solutions/messages for discussion at tomorrow's meeting.  I'll bring hard copies to the meeting. 
 Ok.  Here they are.  On exhibit A, I didn't touch numbers are exhibit #s. Also, I deleted CAPM, since we ain't got anything yet.  And I deleted the part that said "ticket sales taxes don't matter much," because now that we have the numbers they could matter, cuz it's really tight between bond payments and tax revs.  Anyway, that's it.  I checked and doubled checked the numbers and exihibit #s in the exec sum, but you may want to give one last peek.  Thanks SO much for pulling it together.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Mary: Well, the problem is likely just that I'm dense.  I log in, click on deferral and find a description of what one needs to do (i.e., fill out the form), but I've surfed around the site a bit and can't seem to find the form.  Am I (probably) missing something?  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 many thanks, mary.  and michelle, i'm indebted, as always.  if you don't hear from me, that means all went well. 
 Available Wednesday but not Tuesday.  Happy holiday to all. 
 I'm on your man.  What do you need? 
 11 AM PST.  I'll try to be on but can't promise.    Karen Denne 12/07/2000 09:37 AM 
 Can we have a quick call (i.e., no more than 30 minutes) at 9 AM (PST) on Monday to discuss?    Alan Comnes@ECT 12/07/2000 03:07 AM 
 you getting this stuff? 
 will be at both meetings and will have detailed proposals beforehand.  we continue to work on procurement piece and have reached teh same conclusion as you in your note---need something to implement now, as well as a "longer" term solution to IOU procurement.  you'll be hearing from me.    Evelyn Kahl Elsesser <eke@aelaw.com> 12/06/2000 03:44 PM 
 yes, thank you.  see you tonite! 
 Folks:  The "subcommittee" I've referenced that's trying to come up with a solution to California's train wreck is moving very quickly.  The group's shooting to have a first cut at a "straw person" proposal sketched out by end of next week.  The group's meeting on Tuesday to continue to bounce around ideas.  I'd like to try to have an internal call on Monday at either 10 AM (PST) or 3  PM (PST) to pin down at least a vaguely detailed conceptual framework that I can propose to the subcommittee on Tuesday.  The agenda items for the internal meeting are:  Finalize proposal for benchmark(s) for utility procurement. Goal: increase utility willingness to enter into forward contracts by replacing PUC after-the-fact "reasonableness" review with a benchmark. (Been working the Portland desk on a "portfolio benchmark" concept.)  Determine our view of how to treat term contracts w.r.t. the PX credit, i.e., should those contracts be disclosed to the market, or should PUC keep them confidential, calculate the PX credit behind closed doors, and publish the credit ex poste?  The PX credit depends on the overall utility portfolio, not just the PX price.  Let me know if 10 AM or 3 PM (PST) works better.  Harry:  I'll assume that you'll contact the folks from EES that need to participate.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Gavin:  Could you do me a favor (know you're busy).  Someone told me that there's an article in last Thursday's? NYT blaming the California fiasco on former California Commissioner Dan Fessler, who was responsible (a few years back) for putting in place the structure we have here.  Have you seen it?  If so could you forward?  If not, could you try and find it and forward.  Very much appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Mark: I don't know how any "concerns" I may have raised reached you, but rest assured that there are no worries from my end.  I saw the piece on the local news.  Vacar's on a one-person crusade to kill capitalism, that's certain.  It was very clear that you were taken horribly out of context, and they did you a great disservice.  Just between us chickens, it did come up as if you were implying that there's some reasonable likelihood that manipulation's the culprit.  You can imagine just how sensitive we are to that issue.  But I don't think that you should sweat it.  In a very brief conversation with Mike Day I mentioned the piece and that they got you responding to manipulation (i.e., "when'd you stop beating your wife) on camera.  So agitated was I that I didn't even bother to bring it up with Herr Fawcett.  So again, thanks much for the note, but no big deal.  Now for my two cents:  Question:  "what's the problem?"  answer:  "very bad state energy policy---and here are the five big regulatory problems standing in the way of a solution for California....."  "market manipulation?  well, those charges are raised in every industry, whenever prices spike.  the lion's share of the time, it turns out to be market fundamentals."  Appreciate your note.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 perhaps you were a little strong in relaying my concerns to someone? 
 congratulations?  condolences?  anyway, let's talk.  today's bad.  you in tomorrow? 
 Thanks very much Dave.  We've got the proposal (and we've got a few issues with it).  Rog: I know that you're swamped managing EES' book, etc.  So I'd be happy to fill Dave in on EES' view of CLECA's proposal, the negotiations that are underway generally, and what we're cooking up to try to help the negotitations along. Just let me know.  Also, Dave, be happy to talk to Hanson, and fill them in one what's going on out there if that would be useful.  Jeff    David Parquet@ECT 12/07/2000 03:32 PM 
 sorry for the delay.  be great to catch up, but with all this energy mess, i've had to cancel going, unfortunately.  hope you're well.  Best, Jeff 
 fyi.  most responses back have been for 3 pm (from the traders).  also, give dennis a call.  he's polling folks to get views on what ferc's going to do on the 13th.  best, jeff 
 you bet.  i'm at 415.782.7822. 
 Thank you very much for the info.    Anita Taff-Rice <anitatr@earthlink.net> 12/07/2000 07:11 PM 
 Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects.  Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over the goal line:  On Siting Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state. Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in California. That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants. Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the legislation passed yesterday tinkers. Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes. If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will continue, or worsen. California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now.  On the retail price cap They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat them hear) The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning. It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect. Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road. So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely. There's a better answer: Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with another retail provider. Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like Enron.  But for the press reports, they hardly know there's a crisis. 
 FYI.  Per my voice message to you yesterday. 
 Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment?  With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters.  With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the "next big investment opportunity for the coming decade." In Winters' 250 page report, "Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: Set for a Revolution-Part 2," he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation.  "Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980's," said Winters.  "Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality, reliable power," added Winters. According to his research, microturbines are the best positioned of the "new" technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation.  He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, efficient and very versatile. "They can be used as a main power source, a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices," the analyst said. "Microturbines can also be used in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access to electricity." Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other fuels as well.  In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback.  In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering flywheel technology, as a "buy" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading manufacturer of microturbines, as "attractive." The companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral. 
 Thanks very much for the info, Hedy. 
 Folks:  As you recall from out meeting on Tuesday, we decided that I'd pull together a brief description of our key priorities and the actions underway to achieve them.  The status report will be updated weekly.  We'll use the weekly update as an important internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and developments in CA.  It will also serve as a a tool to help identify the need to modify our priorities and/or actions in light of ever-changing circumstances.  We were going to try to get the first report out this week, but with the meeting in Houston, Sue's doctor appt and Karen's meetings with Marathon, we'll get the first one out Monday.  My notes suggest that (today's) key priorities---understanding that everything's subject to change on a daily basis---are: 1. ENA No refunds End wholesale price caps as soon as possible Get forward markets working in CA Expedite plant siting  2. EES No early roll of/maintain the rate freeze (till ~01/02) Maintain current PX credit framework (till ~01/02)  Please forward to me the actions underway and planned in the area for which you've been designated "lead."  Given how fluid things are, It seems prudent to limit "planned" items to those we've got planned for the next 2-4 weeks.  I'll compile for distribution by COB Monday.    My notes show the following leads:  Legislative--Sandi PR--Karen FERC-Sue PUC--Jeff/Sue Miscellaneous (e.g., AB 1890 "subcommittee)--Jeff  Also please let me know if my notes w.r.t. leads is consistent with yours.  Thanks very much and have a great weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 Rick, Jim, Harry:  You will have the first status report for California by COB on Monday.  We will update that report weekly. If there's anything you need between now and Monday, please let me know.  Have a good weekend.  Best, Jeff  FYI:  Yesterday, the California PUC rejected the utilities request to, among other things, raise rates and end the rate freeze.  The status quo prevails, at least for now. 
 Well, you two really raised the bar with that celebration.  It was just fantastic.  Prentice said it's the best birthday she's ever had.  Thanks so much for everything.  It was really neat. 
 The votes have been counted (kidding), and the call will take place today at 3 PM PST.  Call-in number to follow. 
 Could you please set up a call and distribute to this list?  Topic:  utility forward contracting proposal.  Time 3-4:30 pm PST.  Thanks very much. 
 Sounds very good.  Might be useful to get a "reputable" economist to write a paper that 1) describes traditional means for defining, identifying and mitigating market power, 2) compares those with the "new" means folks are coming up with these days,  and 3) comments on the "split" in the academic community over the issues.  When Steve Kean and I discussed the notion initially, thought it might be a good idea to gently "pile on" to the public discussion with the goal of making clear 1) just how complex this issue is and 2) how important it will be to have a thorough analysis (say, about 12+ months worth?) before rushing to judgment on anything Joskow might allege in his paper.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 12/11/2000 10:02 AM 
 I believe that on Thursday/Friday? you sent a note with some suggestions on proposed solutions.  Darned if I can find it.  Could you resend it?  Or, in the flurry of activity, am I mistaken, and the last dispatch I got from you was the note you sent on the 6th?  Apologies, Jeff 
 I've been buried.  What did we hear from FERC last week?  Was that from Larcamp's their visit to Houston? 
 I ain't forgot.  Your proposal is a "touchy" one, and let's just say that it's required some nimble dancing in the attempt to gauge where folks sit, if you get my drift.  I'm still on the case, however. 
 who's on so far? 
 Mon-Thurs:  SF Fri--Sacramento 
 Mike:  Please forward the letter to Jeff.  Jeff, we'll be signing the letter.  Look like something TW can sign.  Give me a ring when you get a chance to look at it.  Best, Jeff 
 Given the messy spot that SDG&E in particular and SoCalGas find themselves in due to what's happened to gas prices at the Cal border, it might not be a bad time to check in with our friend Neil Schmally (sp?) at Sempra to see how Enron might help? 
 In case folks haven't already heard through other sources, a reliable person told me that PG&E is hedged for core gas requirements:  financial--for 45% of core volumes at prices "in the single digits/decatherm" physical--for 15% of core volumes (via storage) at prices "less than the financial hedge"  SDG&E is naked.  SoCalGas is likely in the same boat as SDG&E, or worse, since they optioned core's storage gas to noncore customers, and, those customers are exercising. 
 You're a star.  I owe ya.  Next time you're in town, let me know in advance. Maybe we can have lunch or something.  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff 
 OK. You and I are the last ones to get the info....Here it is. 
 Tim/Bob:  Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its "investigation" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch (or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot.  Best, Jeff 
 Some thoughts on the conference.  Best, Jeff 
 Good luck. 
 Only if it's not a bother.  You're very sweet to forward along.  You must feel GREAT being done! 
 can't wait.    Kathleen E Magruder@EES 12/11/2000 02:22 PM 
 Talked to Eric.  He'll give Kari a ring and pass along message.  Best, Jeff 
 Paul:  Here's additional info for the "curtailment" data that we're pulling together.  Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers  Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on NYMEX monthly prices.  So for example, based on November's forecast, the utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.  When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual prices.  If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the utility will increase January's price forecast by "just enough" to make up for the December undercollection.  If prices were too high and there's an overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough to refund the overcollection.  If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have generally spread out the "true-up" over several months to avoid "rate shock" one way or the other.  However, under the current circumstances, the utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the entire undercollection in the following month.  In short, there's at least a one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts versus actual. 
 Refer such calls to Karen Denne in Houston.  Thanks.    George Waidelich@EES 12/11/2000 04:57 PM 
 I don't want to create an hassles. Don't feel like you have to get the thing all fixed up by Friday if it not's a cake walk.    "Eldon Sellers" <eldon@interx.net> 12/11/2000 05:32 PM Please respond to eldon 
 If all goes well, I'll have some info to distribute before the meeting regarding forward purchases.  I'll be ready to discuss it at the meeting, too. 
 Professor Berk:  Very interesting to hear the perspectives of a South African ex-pat last evening.  Today's been very hectic, but I'll get back to you on the possibility of having Enron sponsor internships for the financial engineering program. Until we've had a chance to talk, could you wait before forwarding my name along to anyone else in the fin eng group?  Much appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Editorial/Opinion  Making it hot for deregulation Gregory Palast The New York Times  08/29/2000 The News & Observer Raleigh, NC  Final A11 (Copyright 2000)    PECONIC, N.Y. -- While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra Streisand's bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, something important was being debated 100 miles to the south in San Diego, where there was a real display of populism. There politicians have enrolled 2 million citizens in a scary economic experiment. This year, San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices. When California's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote into the law that homeowners' bills would fall "by at least 20 percent." In fact, bills jumped 124 percent this August over last. Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment, the federal government and 24 other states have rushed to imitate California's lead.  Actually, Californians were lucky. Every hour of every day, San Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility, must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool. On the first hot day this summer, during the noonday heat, the companies that produce the power, newly deregulated, cranked up their bids to $9,999 per megawatt hour. That's about 5,000 percent more than the once- controlled price of $20, but it could have been worse. According to those inside the secretive auction agency, sellers assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids. In fact, the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day. One can trace California's electricity market plague largely to a single source, Daniel Fessler. In the early 1990s, Fessler, then president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatcher's free-market ventures: the troubled England-Wales Power Pool. How strange. Britons pay about 70 percent more for electricity than Americans. That's hardly a surprise, as each day around tea time, when England's usage peaks, a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction, bidding up prices by 200 percent to 2,000 percent. In the United States, utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past 100 years. The promise lasted several months, during which time five giant international electricity sellers - all new to California - imported the techniques they'd learned in Britain that were designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year. The deregulation bug is now winging eastward. New York City, for example, has reportedly succumbed to 43 percent increases in Con Edison bills. But in San Diego, something extraordinary happened. This month, thousands joined an unprecedented consumers' boycott. The power companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses won't pay. Refuseniks include the Council of Churches, the school district and - without a hint of shame - Steve Peace, the state senator who sponsored the deregulation law. * * * The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gore's campaign. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw California's consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace. And Gov. George W. Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas, which is widely expected produce hefty returns for a former business partner, Sam Wyly, owner of the GreenMountain, a power seller. But while Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against "powerful forces," on this subject he's mum. No wonder: the Clinton-Gore administration still promotes California-style deregulation as a model for the nation. But someone's ready to feel California's pain, and it's not good news for Gore. During the Democrats' big show, Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network, the 46,000-member local group leading the anti-corporate uprising. Electricity is the first big U.S. industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules. For the first time, Americans feel the bite of real globalization, and we don't like it one bit. 
 Thanks---couldn't agree more on the "crisis here"/"need education" assessment.  The more we educate folks, the more they agree with our views and positions.    Karen Denne 12/11/2000 01:18 PM 
 bed situation is as follows:  everyone will be naked and in the same bed; your parents may excuse themselves if they wish.  i'll be there round 7:30. 
 That would work for me.  And presumably Rory and Co. could come then, too?    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 12/12/2000 10:06 AM 
 Can the deal bench presentation be distributed publicly?  I'd like to use it in the "subcommittee" meetings I mentioned last week as a means to a solution for California's reasonableness review morass.  Left a message with Kahn late last evening.  Haven't heard back yet.  Will let you know.  Best, Jeff 
 Frank's number at Luntz Research Companies is 703.358.0080.  For video info, ask Steve Kean.    Karen Denne 12/12/2000 10:52 AM 
 Will do. 
 did they bite (i.e., commerce one)?  i'm very excited.  you hear about the announcement this AM re: Ariba/IBM hooking up with Microsoft to create B2B software? 
 But Rory (who by the way is responsible for this mess!) now has decided that he'd like to do a Xmas "make up" on the 29th, which is smack dab in the middle of when we'll be up at the dome (tween xmas and new year's--hopefully you and eldon will join us so we can kick yer butts in spades).  so the 29th is very bad, as you can imagine.  if we could do the 24th, that would be great.  when's your plane leave on the 24th? 
 do surf shops rent wet suits?  you think i can rent one from live water? 
 yes.  do we have a call-in number yet? 
 Jennifer:  I got a call from Chris Bailey (sp?) needing a summary of California dereg for a presentation(s) that Harold's assembling.  Attached is summary that Mona pulled together for Harold a couple of months ago.  I don't have Chris' email address (I've left him a message).  Could you forward this along to him?  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 yep.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 12/12/2000 11:52 AM 
 Sean:  305.5160 
 naked, all in one bed.  star doesn't need a bed.  prentice and i will need a bed (hey, it's her birthday!)  tom & karen are very iffy, but if they show, and stay overnight (iffy times two), then they'll need a bed.  that work? 
 For today's noon call.  when you open, answer "disable macros" to first prompt, and "no" to question about links.  there are three portfolio scenarios that i'd be happy to discuss very quickly during the call. 
 FYI.  As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the "reasonable review" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.  For that effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to devise a solution to California's melt down.  The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole. 1) "do nothing" 2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed priced power. 3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.  The term of each scenario is 5 years.  Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.  The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if undertaken using a "DealBench-like" tool) ought to be "per se" reasonable.  If anyone has questions about it, or would like to discuss further, give a call at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm faxing the final to you. 
 Agree that Enron shouldn't be the lead.  An economist should be the lead with a broad group of folks funding.  Seems funny that EPSA wouldn't have an interest in the debate over how market power is assessed and addressed.    James D Steffes 12/11/2000 10:27 PM

 Hi.  Got your message.  As you know, it's complete meltdown here, so I apologize for not having got back to you sooner.  I'll read and get back to you.  Deadline? 
 Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:  1. General May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's "import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California. The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily? If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.  2. Specific Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest (Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits the California border.  Mary Hain@ECT 12/12/2000 11:58 AM

 Just met with the industry group trying to come up with a solution for California.  The group liked our portfolio approach. In sum:  A portfolio approach is the right long-term solution. In the short run, our illustrative portfolios show that the utilities ought to immediately fill a modest portion of their requirements via fixed-price, long term contracts, and those contracts should be found reasonable, up front, so long as the utility uses a competitive auction.  To stimulate discussion we proposed that the utility fill 5% of its net short position with 5-year, fixed-price contracts and 5% from 10-year, fixed-price contracts.  Everyone on the call liked the proposal.  After some discussion about whether 5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately. (Edison may want the number to be higher, and the baskets to be different.)  Anything can happen between now and Friday, but thus far looks positive. Thanks to everyone for the help in getting the proposal together, Steve Swain in particular.  (Steve:  We may get asked to run a few more illustrative portfolios for the group.)  I'll report back on what happens at the meeting on Friday.  If there are any questions, etc., just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 NRDC--Ralph CLECA--Barkovich/Booth CMA--McCrae PX--Flory Eve Elsesser Edison--Fielder Sempra Turn--Florio AES--Aaron Thomas (retail) Munis Smutney-IEP  Munis and Florio were not on the call today, but I suspect both will be OK with our proposal. 
 As we discussed, attached is a brief description of ENA's and EES' key goals in California and the actions underway to achieve them.  We'll update the status report weekly.  We hope that the weekly update will serve as a useful internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and developments in CA.  It can also serve as a tool to help identify the need to modify our goals and/or actions as circumstances change.  Comments on the form and/or substance of the document and how we can make it more useful are welcome.  Best, Jeff 
 Joseph will set up the call and distribute to the list.    Rebecca W Cantrell@ECT 12/12/2000 06:56 PM 
 paul.  please leave the number on paul's voicemail since he's traveling. thanks a billion. 
 NRDC, TURN, Edison, Sempra, CLECA (large industrial), AES (formerly NEV), Munis, PX, CMA, Enron.  Though TURN and Munis, while not opposed, are posturing at this point as "noncommittal." 
 Apologies.  Forgot the subject of the meeting.  It's "Strategy for California." 
 Hmmmm.  The world is no longer safe, not even for we relics.  Well, I'l glad to know that at least one adult is involved. 
 yes, and we can discuss storage further if you like. 
 Being a true blue American, I support expansion.  If you get a free minute, can you give me a call to discuss.  My short answer is--no problem, looks good. 
 nada. 
 I'll get you my comments ASAP.  Has Shelley Corman seen it? 
 Kahn's secretary has left messages that he's "very tied up" and continues to try to contact me.  Suggests to me that they may be planning something and he's reluctant to contact folks.  I'll poke around. I thought our stock would go UP when an announcement about Skilling was made. I guess this means you'll be going to D.C. with Lay. 
 I was thinking that you might be able to bring a modicum of legitimacy to it....    Richard Shapiro 12/13/2000 10:49 AM 
 I was thinking that I should probably get another case of coastal.  1) What do you think?  2) Could you have one delivered?  I could pick it up. 
 Going to be an ugly four years.... 
 FYI.  I'm editing now and have several proposed edits.  Should be to you within 20 minutes. 
 I'm available. 
 I'm thinking we need two cases. 
 you got it. 
 My pleasure.  Thanks for the opportunity.  Good luck.  Between the US Supreme Court and the energy crisis, D.C. must be very interesting right about now. 
 Word on the street is that Davis, Hoecker and Richardson are meeting in D.C. today.  That consistent with what your hearing? 
 I'm on the EPSA/IEP call but doing a million things simultaneously.  Lynn's taking a big role on the call.  I think that you should check in with her afterwards to get a briefing since I'll be getting off for another call in the next 5 minutes. 
 please send the call-in number around for 1:30 call when you get.  kaufman's going to be on the call.  thanks, buddy. 
 Mark:  Did you have wind of Jason's story on Edison calling for an end to AB 1890?  His spin on the story was good one---Edison got everything it wanted (out of 1890) and now it wants out of the contract.  The story seems worthy of a response, particularly since Jason's the reporter.  Even the Chair of FERC recognizes that going backwards is not the answer.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for keeping us in the loop.  Good luck. 
 I'm available at 8 am (do while you're driving?) and will make my schedule flexible in the afternoon. 
 That was painful. 
 I feel so useless.  Thanks so much for taking charge of this and doing such a fantastic job.  Are you in close contact with Martin and Doug? 
 Jeannie:  Apologies.  Though I'm sure it doesn't seem like it, I'm on the job.  I'll try to get the numbers and I'll read the piece now.  Best, Jeff 
 I was told that Lynch and Duque released press releases today saying that the Commission does not intend to let the utilities to go bankrupt.  Haven't been able to find any press releases on the CPUC website, however. 
 Professor Aceves:  Attached are a word and an excel file.  Both are formatted for easy print out.  Note that the excel file has two work sheets:  "balance sheet" and "income statement."  I'd be happy to provide you with a hard copy, too, if you would prefer a hard copy.  Just let me know.  Thanks for a great course.  All the best, Jeff 
 dome was cool.  studied, got some shit cleaned up (cut up logs, torn down deck, etc.), picked lots of apples from my trees!  they're so good.  made to apple pies with your folks last nite.  one's at your house--apples, too. picked some killer huckles--gave them to your mom.  dove for abalone---water was HORRIBLE, though.  ate it last nite.  one in your refrigerator.  got killed in the pool.  annie ate rat poison, had to drive to S.R. sunday nite; got back about midnight.  you know, same ol' shit.  you? 
 Mary:  FYI.  Ms Mara's back.  Please include her on everything, too.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  I'm hear in Houston---currently at Elizabeth's desk.  Do we have a number for Sue Nord and Scott to call into?  Or are we just going to call them from the conference room?  I'll come look for you later.  Best,' Jeff 
 You're welcome.  When would you like to talk re: Mr. Bray?  And please give me your number again---I've switched computers and gone to Windows 2000. What a bloody mess.  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is.  And I have JUST been informed that I have to be on a conference call tomorrow from 1-2.  Could we do our call at noon or 2 pm California time?  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Best, Jeff 
 You're a gem. 
 jackasses?  that might not be a word we'd want to use in emails that might, shall we say, get into unfriendly hands.... 
 Given that the hearing is Friday, we'll need to decide pretty quickly. Might be useful to discuss on a call first thing tomorrow AM?  We'll want to assure that our message is tracks consistently with message J. Skilling will be delivering this week and with other messages we'llbe delivering (e.g., FERC inquiry).  Also, attached are some messages that Jim distributed following a focus group conducted in Orange County. 
 Greetings:  As part of our final tariff filing, we need to submit "sample" forms for things like a Disconnect Notice, Sample Bill and New Service Orders.? Do we have any?  Have we had to file any elsewhere?  If not, do we want Bowen & Co. to "create" some for us to review, or do we prefer to find the right folks internal to EBS and create them internally?  Make sense to arrange a 15-30 minute call to discuss how to execute?  All opinions, views, etc. are encouraged and welcome.  Best, Jeff 
 Ain't seen the joint resolution, thought my in-box is a mess.  Did you send that around? 
 Could you please see if you can get a copy (electronic) preferably of this? Greatly appreciated. 
 done at 9:30.  can you pick me up.  i'd love it.  check your voicemail, too. i left a message there. 
 Jeff/Drew:  Been out all day.  Will get a copy.  I believe that Jeff's suspicions are dead on.  Given all the investigations regarding electricity "price spikes" in California, seems very likely that Edison feels the timing is right to push the gas issue.  Will confirm that it is targeted solely at El Paso and get back to you either way.  If there's anything else, just holler. Will keep you apprised of events as they occur.  Best, Jeff 
 I can wait a little bit.  But let's coordinate, OK? 
 glad to hear that you're back, generalissimo.  we will follow you up the hill.  seriously, though, you will start seeing/hearing from us quite soon., e.g., skilling's at the national press club this thursday. 
 Hi Darlin':  Thanks again for everything last night.  All kidding aside, I wish you all the best with your procedure tomorrow.  I'll be sending lots of positives vibes your way all day, and I'm sure we'll be up to see you this weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 No duplication.  With both of us trying to dig up a copy, we're sure to find one!  Best, Jeff 
 sorry, your mom kept the huckles. 
 Will do.    Drew Fossum@ENRON 09/05/2000 03:58 PM 
 I will check.  Good chance that I will be there, too.    Allison Navin@ENRON 09/05/2000 03:53 PM 
 call me at 415.505.6633.  thx, jeff d. 
 Jessie:  Steve Kean and I need to be at the following address on the 11th:  County Adminstration Center Building, 1600 Pacific Highway in San Diego.  Can you recommend a hotel that's near by and tolerable.  Much appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 My pleasure. Sounds like he's got a big job---glad that Enron can help.... 
 OK. 
 Getting you the info by the end of the week, or sooner, will not be a problem.    Michael Etringer@ECT  09/05/2000 03:37 PM 
 you might want to try using a landline phone, sweetie.  only 35 cents.  works great. 
 did you burn the man?  are we having lunch?  are you famous now? 
 i love you very much and miss you. 
 tomorrow is absolutely horrible for me.  let's talk in the am.  perhaps you and mona, sue and sandi can cover sans moi. 
 Haven't had a chance to read yet, but wanted to get to folks ASAP. - motion.doc 
 Everyone, meet everyone else's email address.  Thanks to one and all for the taking the time to discuss the issues.  Seems that the conensus is that the meeting was useful.  Have a great weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 don't apologize.  more interesting when your blood boils. 
 Jessie Knight, the CEO of the S.D. Chamber of Commerce recommends:  Stay at the hotel right here where the Chamber is located.  It is one of the best and a 5 minute taxi away for you.  It is called the Whyndham (on Broadway).    Allison Navin@ENRON 09/05/2000 03:53 PM 
 I'm on the phone with Jim now.  If you want to contact him, I'd wait 5-10 minutes and give him a call on his cell phone. 
 floated idea.  people like.  but.....(hate to sound like a broken record) the whole ball of wax from Enron's view regarding sponsorship, streaming, etc., will depend on the agenda/participants).  looking forward to the call.  i'll only have 60 minutes max, however, so counting on you to facilitate forcefully. 
 Lara:  I have rather hastily put this list together.  For that I apologize. Hope it is helpful.  The things on the list are ones that you've likely already considered.  Nevertheless, some of the issues we face in California include:  1. POWER PLANTS The utilities' subs are building power plants; competitors (like Enron) are also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail markets. The utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid. The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors. This would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level (i.e., how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility can favor its subs plants via interconnection?).  2. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG:  in California many are pointing to DG as a viable solution to the price spikes. If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive to thwart interconnection of the DG unit.  (Recall that in many places, recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs). In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection. This permits the utility to retain bundled service customers.  Utility control of DG Interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its DG subs.  3. INTERCONNECTION/VOLTAGE BUY-UP And the same goes for the retail level---remember how SDG&E used interconnection to thwart our deal with South West Marine in San Diego. (Obviously, we're not doing these deals any more, but the interconnection caused us ultimately to lose the commodity deal, too.)  4. TRADING PG&E and Sempra have developed significant trading units. Now that the utilities have been granted authority to buy outside the PX, the trading subs are getting more aggressive and vocal about the opportunity to sell the utility power via short and long term power contracts. Again, any sort of favoritism could do considerable harm to consumers and competition (through the shareholders of the utilities' parent would surely profit).  5. DISTRIBUTION In general, the utilities control over distribution is complete and it's a problem (see DG, above, for example). Shouldn't state and federal policy makers at least consider doing the equivalent of FERC Order 888 (i.e., open access) at the distribution level? Right now, distribution is a real black box.  6. RETAIL In California, the utility effectively controls customer sign-up, switching, information, and turn back.  The problems have been significant.  7. MARKET INSTITUTIONS Finally, a big mistake in California was to replace one monopoly--the utility--with another--the PX. Because the utility has been forced to buy from the PX, and because the market structure in California gives customers no incentive to switch, the utility continues to control the overwhelming majority of the load in California. This gives the utilities monopsony power.  With that power, they can influence PX prices. Solution:  1) Don't make the PX a monopoly. 2) Create a system that provides customers with the incentive to switch.  If you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 Plz see email.  Sent you info for u & Rick.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Kevin:  Got your message.  I will be at the FERC hearing on Tuesday.  You like me to fill you in on what transpires?  Best, Jeff 
 in conf. call hell.  can i fax for your review? 
 on its way.  plz review and call.  best, jeff 
 i expected as much.  and lunch? 
 off that call and on another.  will call your cell soon as this one's done. 
 will that's some good news.  thanks. 
 Sue Mara called from the ISO:  The Market Issues Committee rejected lowering the price cap from $250. The Market Issues Committe of the Board voted to extend the ISO price cap authority beyond October 15th, with no end date. ISO Board will vote on these issues tomorrow. 75% chance that the ISO Board will adopt the Issues Committe's recommendations. 
 pleasure's all mine.  anything else i can do, just holler. 
 EBS Update FERC Update (w/Sue) Congressional and FERC hearings in S.D. next week Gas Update     Joseph Alamo 09/06/2000 07:02 PM 
 As you know, I have great interest.  However, I've checked flight schedules to come out Tuesday night, and to put it mildly, it's very ugly.  Seems like alot to arrive in D.C. around 3 AM only to turn around and head back to the left coast the next day at 3-4 PM.  But I think the meeting should go ahead and take place anyway.  Is there any chance that Lisa could get a phone in your meeting room so that I could participate by conference call?  Sorry for the headache.  Let me know.  Thanks again for the chat this PM.  Best, Jeff 
 Great food for thought.  Thanks.  My only concern is timing.  Likely to be spending the balance of the week (tomorrow and Friday) on prep for the FERC/House subcomittee hearings. We can discuss further on the staff meeting call tomorrow. 
 FYI.  Under the settlement with SoCal, PG&E and countless others, Altra was going to provide the platform for the (unregulated) secondary markets in intrastate storage, capacity and imbalance trading rights.  Altra declined and SoCal and PG&E will now look for someone else to provide the service. 
 Thanks again. 
 Dear Ms Leisure:  If you're still tanning, and still up for lunch, I'm game.  Besides, I owe you a beer.  Let me know.  Don't work too hard,  Best, Jeff 
 ferget it.  i'm just as swamped.  i don't care if you've got a goddamed boyfriend and a busy job.  friday we're having coffee.  for 30 rotten minutes.  you name the place and the time.  hugs and kisses, jeff 
 Thanks, Sue.  Agreed.  Also, I met today with Bowen & Co. re: interconnection.  We have some decisions to make on that front, too, which will also require a bit of discussion.  Tracy, I'm sure that Scott's in Istanbul and Donald's in Marrakesh.  Could you try to track those two broadband cowboys down and see if we can set up a conference call for next Wedneday (hopefully, that's ample lead time)?  Finally, the draft final tariff (in strike-out-underline form) will be ready for review by COB Friday.  I'll email it around.  Hope all is well with all.  Best, Jeff 
 Please keep the following confidential.  Jessie Knight called.  Here's the latest.  Seems the Chamber of Commerce is going to launch a campaign with the following messages:  1) Deregulation must go forward, not back.  2) The transition will continue to be a bit bumpy.  3) The best option businesses and families have is to switch to an alternative service provider.  The Chamber has cut deals with ESPs (I didn't get all the details, but sounds like an exclusive) according to which the Chamber will aggregate customers and deliver them to the ESPs.  I believe that The New Power Company will be one of those ESPs.  Ray McNally's sister, who is one of our very satisfied rez customers in S.D., will appear at the press conference with the Chamber to announce the program.  They are attempting to launch the program and have the press conference this week.  The Chamber is also launching a program to educate S.D. politicians and business leaders on the benefits of retail choice and how to benefit from it.  The Chamber is still looking for a business customer to appear with them at the press conference. 
 just goe your email.  all go well?  415.782.7822. 
 Thanks.  We're on the same page.  Already notified folks.  But given the witch hunt, figured we'd sit back and let things run their course.     MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> on 09/07/2000 12:03:27 PM 
 can you give me a call when you get a minute---415.782.7822.  Thanks a bunch. 
 Paul and Lysa:  I want to apologize in advance.  It now seems that FERC has realized that it has a biz meeting in D.C. on the 13th, which makes having a meeting in San Diego on the 12th somewhat difficult.  So, if FERC changes the date (again) and pushes the meeting back, I'll go to S.D. on the 11th to see Steve Kean testify and fly to D.C. on the evening of the 11th or morning of the 12th and attend Paul's meeting in person.  If they don't change the date and it stays on the 12th, I won't go to D.C. and will participate in Paul's meeting on the 12th in D.C. by phone.  I'll let you know what FERC decides, when it decides it.  Exasperatedly yours, Jeff 
 Looks good.  I vote yes. 
 Mona suggested that it would be a good idea to try to schedule a separate meeting to discuss rather than attempt to do it during our weekly staff meeting.  Let me know if this date works. 
 FYI. 
 would seem useful if we all contribute in some manner, but i'm open to suggestions.  perhaps we could divvy up the questions. 
 I'll be in S.D. on Monday to watch.  What time do you go on? 
 Ariba Hits Some Speed Bumps on the Fast-Growth Highway By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 9/7/00 3:21 PM ET URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1070107.html  SAN FRANCISCO -- In a sign that the business-to-business software game is tough even when you're on top, Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq) has been running into problems this summer, both at home and abroad. Ariba told analysts and investors at a private breakout session here Tuesday at the Robertson Stephens Internet Conference that its business in Europe this summer has been "soft," according to Eric Upin, an analyst at the firm. And at home, analysts are starting to talk about problems the company has had integrating its Tradex software into its own and customers' systems. An Ariba spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call seeking a comment. The challenges Ariba is facing illustrate how difficult it can be to stay ahead of the game in an emerging industry, even for one of its most aggressive leaders. And they come at a time when its main competitor, Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), is gaining momentum in key markets -- including Europe -- through its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR). Upin, who rates Ariba a buy and lists the company as one of his top B2B picks, says the new concerns have to be taken in context. (His firm hasn't performed underwriting for the company.) "Ariba's just getting ramped up in Europe, and Europe's slow during the summer. It's a tiny part of their business," Upin said. "But there was concern because Ariba was saying that business was soft [in Europe] in August." That concern has been reflected in Ariba's stock, which is trading just under $162, off from its Sept. 1 close of $166.25. It fell 6.1% Wednesday after the breakout session, though it's up about 3% Thursday. With the stock trading at more than 70 times next year's projected sales, it's priced to perfection. Ariba's softness in Europe comes at a time when Commerce One has been making strides there. Its partnership with SAP has resulted in six new customers so far. Commerce One also announced a joint marketing and sales alliance with Intershop, another German software maker, on Thursday. At home, Ariba has been encountering problems in integrating its Tradex software, which enables users to participate in auctions over the Internet, into its customers' systems, as well as into its own software platform. Ian Toll, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, says those problems shouldn't be viewed as too much of an impediment for Ariba. But they do illustrate the complexities of building software that is designed to do everything from manage back-office accounting systems to trade real-time with outside partners. "Implementation has certainly been a concern with Tradex," Toll said. "Certain Tradex customers have highlighted what appear to be longer time lines than they had hoped for. But I think that's true across competing vendors as well." (Toll rates Ariba a buy, and his firm hasn't done underwriting for the company.) While Ariba issued a news release Thursday crowing about how drugstore operator CVS (CVS:NYSE) recently went live on its Ariba Buyer software in just 60 days, observers say that getting Tradex installed and working is taking closer to six months. In the hard-charging world of B2B, that's an eternity. Ariba completed its acquisition of Tradex in March. Ariba has hailed the acquisition as one that gives it best-of-breed auction capability, which it would integrate into its own suite of software products. But competitors, most notably Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq), pooh-poohed the deal, saying that stringing together complex technologies through acquisitions is easier said than done. And in its most recent quarterly results release, when it reported record revenue of $80.7 million that was backed up by $153 million in deferred revenue, the company cautioned that integration of Tradex could be a stumbling point. In the release's boilerplate section that noted that actual results could differ from projections, Ariba said those differences could result from, among other things, "difficulties in assimilating companies recently acquired, including Tradex." Despite the problems, though, analysts are still positive on the company. "Ariba could be the next Oracle," Robbie Stephens' Upin said. "And there were quarters when Oracle promised and didn't deliver or it missed altogether. But even for an Ariba, there will be those bumps along the road." But as competition increases in the B2B sector, those bumps are getting more pronounced. 
 Looks like I won't be going to Washington, but I will participate in the strategy meeting by phone on the 12th.     "Mary Hain" <Mary.Hain@enron.com> on 09/07/2000 07:15:55 PM 
 Folks:  My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.  Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.  I have been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note to Littlechild.  I have been working to try to establish a joint venture between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an "energy summit," where national and international energy leaders would converge on California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.  Jim Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.  In short,, our goal was to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde notions of "turn the clock back" that the Governor of California's two most recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The "energy heads of state" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.  The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on proposals I have made to the "steering committee."  However, for reasons I won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a fiasco.  I notified the group this week that Enron would not be participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came to agreement on the agenda and particpants.  From my perspective, the effort turned out to be a rather big disappointment.  I urge us not to get involved or contribute $$s.  At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay participate.  Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may  or may not want to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm pessimistic at this point.  If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.  I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.  But the forum that these folks are creating ain't the right one.  Best, Jeff 
 Rick:  Thanks very much. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Thanks, Cynthia.  Extreme rhetoric likely from Ms Lynch, CPUC Prez, UCAN and Sempra chief (Steve Baum).  Rest of panel looking pretty good.  Might be useful to let Smutney do at least the lion's share of the "responding" to Ms Lynch's and Mr. Baum's rabid attacks on generators.  Smutney's had a lot of practice in the last couple of months and he's close to the issue.  But, of course, a few well placed jabs, couldn't hurt....    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 09/08/2000 12:23 PM 
 I do plan on accompanying Steve.  Steve, you want me to bring the copies.  Be glad to.  What time does the party start?    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 09/08/2000 12:38 PM 
 Attached are the draft message points.  As always, all comments, suggestions, etc. are encouraged and welcome.  I have five minutes.  Consequently, based on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to round things out.  Joe/Mary:  any final word on format/participants?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Do we know what time the party starts? 
 i'll call my folks right now. 
 just remembered that my folks are in connecticutt.  if you want to go to the game, i'll go with you.  can you call me (from a land line phone)? 
 John/Gia:  You asked that we attempt to evaluate our activities.  Working with TW, I've valued this one.  The California Commission ruled that the "Hector Road" natural gas recent point in California ought to be made a primary receipt point.  This would have had the effect of TW losing access right to 200 MMcf/d of capacity at SoCalGas' Needles receipt point.  Best case scenario:  Under SFV rates, loss to TW is commodity rates (wash) and the fuel margin.  TW calculates the fuel margin to be $5.8MM/yr.  Bad case:  If shippers on TW try to make the case that TW is at fault for losing the primary access rights, then TW is at risk for the demand component of the contracts associated with the 200 MMcf/d.  TW calculates the demand charges loss to be $16.5 MM/yr.  Worse case:  In addition to actual damages listed above, shippers face performance penalties and other contractual damages (from their customers) and they try to pass those costs on to TW.  I discussions with TW, we concluded that the most likely case fell between "best" and "bad," somewhere in the $12-15MM/yr range.  TW believes that without the assistance of CA Gov't Affairs in the case, the $12-15 MM/yr would have been lost.  Be happy to discuss with you further.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm working on my assistant's computer, who has sharing rights to my email. How's it going? 
 arrive S.D. Sunday nite.  staying at wyndahm on Broadway.  Breakfast? 
 Hey, sounds like life in Bay Watch is treating you well.  Glad to hear you've got some classes--8 units?  You really are a bit of a Type A+.  Week after next would be best for lunch.  Next week is completely nuts.  I may miss both Monday and Tuesday.  Happy hour is a great idea.  I think it's your turn to organize.  Have a super weekend  (I've caught a cold, and haven't cracked a book since school started, so looks like I'll be buried in books all weekend).  Best, Jeff  P.S.  "Sent by Joseph Alamo" because my computer has completely died, and I'm using my assistant's computer. 
 Hi.  I'm going to forward you a bunch of stuff, starting with this.  Hope you and yours are doing well.  Best, Jeff 
 Monday--S.D. at congressional hearing w/S. Kean Tuesday--S.D. appearing at FERC hearing Wed--In office Thur--In office--Meeting with LECG re: study on competition v. command and control Frid--In office 
 Greetings folks.  We should decide how we want to handle.  One thing I'm not clear on and that I couldn't find in the syllabus is, what's the format for the write up?  If we're called on to discuss, do we simply discuss orally, some sort of simplistic PP slides, spreadsheets, other?  Anyway to discuss between now and Monday, or do we want to just take Dylan up on his offer?  Best, Jeff 
 If there's other stuff you need, or if you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Kim's stuff looks pretty good to me.  There's a pretty high likelihood though that I won't be in class Monday or Tuesday either.  That means I can't turn in whatever it is we're turning in tomorrow (if I sound clueless, it might be because he ran out of handouts in the first class describing how the cases would work, and there's nothing posted on the site--apologies).  I can do the write-up for next week. 
 Thanks, Dylan.  In the event I can't make to either class, I'm available Wed and Thur evening to discuss the next case.  And as I mentioned, I'd be happy to write that one up.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much.  Now I just need to get the workspace view I had before you had to re-install notes.  Best, Jeff 
 I think the answer to #1 is:  as much as possible, but I'm not altogether certain--pretty sure that our preference would be to use our own internal construction folks as much as possible.  Answer to #2 would be very interesting; I don't know the answer, but I'm sure that it's tightly linked to the answer to #1.  I think you might want to start with Shelly Corman to find the right contact for the pipeline constructions.  I leave for S.D. tonite.  I'll give you updates as the day transpires tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Didn't receive your attachements.  Only got the ones Kim had already sent. Did you just modify those, or create a new document? 
 I'd say, "What next?", but I'm afraid to ask.... Regarding our California strategy, preventing the merger would seem to be right up there with "end the price caps" in our list of priorities.  At today's FERC hearing, a hair-brained consumer advocate called for merging the PX and the ISO.  During the panel I was on, I made the point that a merger would make California's problems worse than they are today.  The FERC Commissioners seemed somewhat responsive to my concerns. P.S. After the panel, Heber lobbied me hard to support transcos. DJ Freeman Sees Cal/ISO, PX Merger, Lower Price Cap Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES SAN DIEGO (Dow Jones) -- David Freeman, seen a likely replacement for Marcie Edwards on the board of governors of the California Independent System Operator, said his first order of business would be to try and merge the ISO and the California Power Exchange. Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday. An informal consensus among the board has already approved his membership. Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the $250 per megawatthour wholesale power price cap in California is too high, and that he would like to see it reduced below $100/MWh. "I think my role (on the board) will help the state solve it's serious generation shortage problem," Freeman said. Some market participants said Freeman is expected to run for chair of the ISO's board of governors, a seat currently held by Jan Smutny-Jones. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has this summer been able to sell the ISO power in the real time market, and make a great profit for itself in return. By Jason Leopold (323)658-3874. 
 Apologies.  I invariably leave someone of the damned list. 
 Jim:  After today's hearing, I think you're note is dead on.  Let's talk. I'm in the office tomorrow.  Miss seeing you all in D.C.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey darlin'.  How are you?  Bet NYC is mighty nice this time of year.  Hope to get there real soon.  Best to you and your better half, Jeff 
 Can we talk before you bring it up with SoCal?  Very interesting about Herr Cherry.  Hadn't heard.  I'm coming out soon to see you guys. 
 It would be great to get Bryson. 
 sit tight.     MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> on 09/12/2000 02:03:16 PM 
 I don't have the name of the CFO at Sempra, though I'm sure he's on their website.  If not, let me know. 
 Thanks, Jim.  We'll monitor.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Ron.  Greatly appreciated.  For my part, please feel free to forward along any articles.  Best, Jeff 
 I can be on the call.  Please let me know if you get this, since I've been having severe email problems.  Thanks.   Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Kahn's heading up the "power plant streamlining" task force.  At yesterday's FERC hearing, Mike was put in the position of reading word for word a statement by the governor (even had to read it in the first person). Awkward to say the least.  And Mike wasn't prepared at all to answer the questions he got on the statement from the FERC commissioners, particularly from Heber.  "I don't know" came up a lot. 
 Never mentioned the CFO.  Let's discuss further.  I can get you in. 
 FYI.  Please take a look.  I would not be inclined to sign the letter. Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 See page 46 of the PDF file, Article 10 "nonutility power providers."  that's where sec. 390 is. 
 Not a problem, Jimmie.  About this week's case.  Been travelling.  I'm back. Kim:  in your absence on Monday, we talked a little about how to proceed on the next case.  How's this sound:  everyone takes a question.  If the answer to one question depends on the answer to another, the folks doing those questions should get together and discuss.  Everyone should distribute to the team a draft of the answer to the question by tomorrow (Thursday) night. Then folks could look at the responses, make suggestions, comments, etc. and distribute via email by Noon on Saturday.  I'll then compile in a form that we can submit on Monday.  Thoughts?  I have randomly selected questions:  here are the results.  Jeff--#3; Jimmie--#1; Kim--#2; Dylan--#4.  If folks are comfortable with this distribution, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Looks good.  Couple of proposed edits. 
 Covisint Running Out of Excuses to Deliver on Its B2B Promise By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 9/13/00 9:09 AM ET URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1076377.html Uh-oh. Covisint can't blame it on the government anymore. When word came Monday that the Federal Trade Commission had green-lighted the Big Three automakers' Internet exchange, the business-to-business world breathed a collective sigh of relief. That huge cloud of uncertainty, known as government intervention, had been lifted. Which means Covisint can't blame its state of disarray on the policy wonks anymore. Instead, the company will have to execute on its B2B promise -- soon -- for positive momentum to continue in the B2B sector. The influence of the mega exchange, in which Ford (F:NYSE), General Motors (GM:NYSE) and DaimlerChrysler (DCX:NYSE) plan to buy materials and supplies on the Internet, has already affected the performance of business-to-business stocks. Just look at Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq) on Monday, when Covisint's FTC clearance was made public. It shot up $3.75, or 5.3%, to close at $75.13, though it had traded as high as $78.13. But Tuesday, after the initial impact of Covisint's clearance had waned, so did Commerce One's stock price. It closed down $6, or 8%, at $69.12. Similarly, when the antitrust issues started creeping onto the B2B scene, and the government made known that it was looking at the exchange over antitrust concerns, B2B stocks swooned. Now, going forward, how Covisint executes on making B2B a reality, and not just the substance of a press release, will surely play itself out on B2B stocks. Right now, though, the company's prospect for swift and flawless execution of its vision doesn't look good. It hasn't named a CEO. It hasn't finalized yet where its headquarters will be. And perhaps most important, it has yet to hammer out exactly what technology it will run on. "Covisint doesn't have a crutch or an excuse anymore," says Scott Crompton, vice president for global automotive practices at consultant SeraNova. "Before, they could lean on the FTC as to why they weren't going forward, but now, they're going to have to show some meaningful progress." To date, there has been anything but. In its first few months, the company stumbled about nameless, until Covisint was decided upon. That moniker, which is meant to evoke the ideals of communication, vision and integration, instead elicited visions of corporate wonks sitting around a triangular table white-boarding their separate goals. All the while, the company had four interim co-CEOs and two competing technologies to run on. Because Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) had worked with Ford and Commerce One with GM before Covisint was announced, the two software firms were both brought into the deal. But ever since then, speculation has run rampant over whether one firm would push the other out of the picture. On Monday, Commerce One's CEO told TheStreet.com that the technology question still hadn't been settled, even if the FTC's antitrust ones had. Combine all those things and what you've got is the picture of a joint venture between three highly competitive companies that's going nowhere fast. Or, as Crompton puts it, Covisint is "three different companies, two different technologies and everyone talking about whether there's a lot of arguing and infighting." But Covisint's already come up with someone else to blame. Now that the FTC has passed, the company says that it's waiting for approval from the Bundeskartellamt, or the German equivalent to the FTC. Covisint insists it can't even begin operations in the U.S. until it gets the go-ahead from that agency. "If you were a supplier and I was a manufacturer, both located in San Francisco, we could not do business because the Bundeskartellamt still holds this control over Covisint," says Thomas Hill, a Covisint spokesman. "Everyone at Covisint is anxious to start this business. Once the Bundeskartellamt gives its blessing, we expect to see Covisint up and running in 30 days." Hill concedes that might sound like another excuse for justifying its lack of actual operations. "Sure, that might seem like another convenient excuse to delay a launch," Hill said. "I would say if people could work 25 hours a day to get this done, they would. ... Everyone at Covisint is focused on launching in a really timely fashion." The company hasn't settled on a headquarters, in part, because it expects its yet-to-be-named CEO to have some input into that decision. And as far as that CEO goes, Covisint is still looking for one. Again, Hill said it was hard to fill the spot when the FTC was probing the endeavor because of the uncertainty that it brought with it. "If you're a CEO, why would you leave your current job and take the Covisint job before the FTC approved it?" Hill offered. "And on the other hand, if you're the FTC and you see the company you're reviewing hiring people, that might make you look a little more closely at what they're doing." Both good points. But the fact remains that Covisint still has a lot more work to do to get up and running, and these kinds of challenges tend to take more time than expected, not less. And if those challenges become problems for the company, the company could become a problem for the entire B2B sector, as investors realize all over again how hard it will be to make B2B work. So the FTC's approval, while good for the ideal of B2B in general, might have come a bit early for Covisint and the public B2B companies now trying to show real results going forward. "My perspective is that this approval from the FTC is very important for the industry as a whole, but it shouldn't be a suggestion that Covisint has anything wonderful in the works," says Ben Smith, a consultant with A.T. Kearney. (His firm is a subsidiary of EDS, which formerly was a part of General Motors.) "Now we can move on to execution. But this doesn't suggest that Covisint has moved to that stage." Which means investors in B2B should watch the performance of this exchange closely. 
 Forgive the length, but it was a long couple of days.  Apologies in advance, since I'm sure I've missed something.  Hopefully, it hits the highlights and gives a good flavor.  Please foreward to anyone I've inadvertently missed. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  Best, Jeff

 Thanks for the update.  Just want to add that 1) if we're uneasy about wearing the full requirements risk, then focusing on offering a purely wholesale deal can still be very attractive, given SDG&E's blunders w.r.t. procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers.  And 2) the CPUC has been beat up pretty well for tying the IOUs hands in attempting to hedge, so they'll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to pre-approve if a deal is offered that can be show to shield San Diegans from volatility and that looks"attractive."  Appreciate being kept in the loop on the details.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 plz call when you can.  thanks, jeff  415.782.7822. 
 The CPUC can do it it it wants---it's a decision about risk and reward.  If the CPUC wants to set up a mechanism by which pre-approval is permitted, it can do so.  Here's the catch, pre-approval means that the IOU has to be willing (generally) to accept a bit more risk.  They don't like that.  The CPUC has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control---this Commission definitely doesn't like that idea.  So often, the utility puts up a proposal that the Commission says places to much risk with granny.  The CPUC often issues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control (read "second-guessing") with the Commission (and therefore leaves to much risk with the utility).  In the end, the utility often "declines" the Commission's offer.  However, it can be done.  For example, under California's restructuring law, the utility's purchases from the PX are just and reasonable, period.   (Of course, we see where the incentive built into that mechanism got us--a debacle.)  Do you have PG&E's and Edison's proposals filed regarding bilaterals some weeks ago, in which they propose certain pre-approval mechanisms?  The Commission didn't adopt them wholesale, and the decision has made PG&E and Edison reticent to sign any such as a result---witness the unfruitful RFPs.  This at all helpful? 
 Honey, I really want to come, but my homework is due to my group tonite and I haven't even started it.  I love you tons and hope you understand.  Please call your mom.  She was a pain on the phone today, saying there's no need to remove the stumps at the dome.  Jeff's willing to do ALL THREE for $350.  It's just ridiculous and I am having a hard time haggling anymore.  I love you tons.  And if you want to talk more about dinner, please call me.  I'm sorry, but there's just too darned much to do.  (I think my cold's getting worse, not better.  :(   xoxoxoxoxox 
 thanks very much for the info.  certainly makes it interesting.  how's things?  P.S. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM and made a whopping $415 MM!!!  Are they gouging San Diegans?  Are they "gaming" the system?  Inquiring minds want to know.  You may want to check in with Smutney when Edison made the statement.  There may be nothing to it, but it might be interesting to check into.  Is Edison one of those "profiteers" who ought to give San Diegans a refund? 
 10 AM works for me. 
 Needs to know before your parents leave for Mexico, which is tomorrow, unfortunately.  I guess I'll be at my house.  You want to stay there, or you want to stay at your place?  Either way's OK with me. 
 FYI.  In case you're interested. 
 Thanks very much to all for your assistance.  Is it possible to get some idea of exactly what the amount to be refunded is?  Thanks so much again for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Who are John and Kittina?  Who are the others you've invited?  What's the occasion?  When's your anniversary?  Why is there a foie gras shortage? 
 Good points, Chris, and well taken.  The PUC Commisisoners took some heat for their heavy-handed approach at hearings held by Congress on Monday and FERC on Tuesday.  I think those hearings may have loosened things the Commission up at least somewhat, though finding a balance between Commission willingness to grant pre-approval and utility willingness to wear some risk in exchange won't be a cakewalk.  We need to remind the Commission that they gave 100 % pre-approved reasonableness for purchases from the PX, and that pre-approval for other purchases is necessary.  That said, I concur that it ain't a gimmee.  Best, Jeff 
 Not a problem.  the schedule was only a suggestion.  work it in when you can.  and if you get totally fried, just say so, and we can take on the question. 
 3 words:  steffes, steffes, steffes 
 i love you.  thanks for being so sweet. 
 Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few inaccuracies and 2) massage some of the sharper language without taking a chainsaw to the otherwise good job. 
 How long you going for?  I'm jealous. 
 Might have perhaps been simpler if Bill "Al Haig" Richardson had announced at the press conference yesterday that he was ordering his energy company, BPA, to stop "withholding" and send power to California.    Cynthia Sandherr 12/14/2000 10:37 AM 
 Can you believe this? 
 Ralph:  No one else had any problems with it.  It's a simply Excel file that should show graphs with 3 "portfolio scenarios."  Would you like me to fax to you, or bring copies to tomorrow's meeting? 
 Sue, Sandi, Paul:  Let's try to discuss and collect any comments we have this afternoon at our weekly staff meeting. 
 Thanks.  The hearings were tiresome, but hanging out with you and Steve was a real treat.  Hope to do it again soon.  You probably noticed that, in my summary, I made no mention of the shoes that I was wearing.....  Best, Jeff 
 apologies.  could you resend me the id and password to get into EOL.  thanks a bunch. 
 Professor Aceves:  Could you let me know that you received the final exam files that I sent last nite?  I'll sleep easier knowing that you've received them and that they're not floating around somewhere in cyberspace.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry.  Been a bit crazy around here.  Thanks for the note, and thank you for doing such a good job at driving this process.  My thoughts on your proposal (and these are very preliminary):  1) politicians may not be willing to go as high as 25% for fear of being accused of a "utility bailout"--maybe 10-15%? though utility solvency may force their hands.  2) TURN will go ape-#%#$ if we make the "roll off" retroactive to October.  3) I'm willing to allow utilities to collect TRA undercollections, but feel that customers and utilities (not me) need to figure out precisely what that number is.  Look forward to getting closure tomorrow, though I'm very concerned that we've lost Edison, given Bryson's public calls to return to 1950.  Best, Jeff    Evelyn Kahl Elsesser <eke@aelaw.com> 12/12/2000 06:57 PM 
 Actually, please keep doing this, but send them only to Miyung Buster and ask that they be included in the group of articles sent out to everyone twice a day.  Miyung's in charge of compiling and distributing such articles on a twice-a-day basis.  Thanks a bunch. 
 Glad to hear that you're on the distribution.  I think it's vital that you attend.  It's a centrist group that's making a lot of progress.  But chances for success will be greatly diminished without PG&E's participation.  Best, Jeff 
 P.S. If you're responsible for getting Dan there, you're a genius.  I've written Dan a note telling him that it's absolutely critical that he be there.  Maybe you could ask the other folks on the distribution to urge Dan to come, too.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Kari:  I know that you and I are both swamped, so I'm writing very briefly to give you a brief update.  But first, thank you very much again for meeting last week.  Greatly appreciated, and look forward to working together to help in any way I can to find solution that is acceptable to all. Here's the update:  Our "subcommitte" is meeting tomorrow to try to close the deal on a proposed solution.  It focuses on 3 key areas:  Using the utilities retained assets to moderate prices. Designing a framework for forward contracting that strikes a much more appropriate balance in CA between state oversight and the need for utility flexibility. Rate stabilization/Undercollections (utility solvency)  I will update you tomorrow on the group's progress.  If thing's go according to plan, we may be in a position to submit something to you a early as Monday.  If there's a deadline from your end that I ought to be aware of, let me know and I'll incorporate it into the subcommittee's work plan.  In the meantime, if there is anything at all that I can do to help, please don't hesitiate to contact me.  Thanks again and all the best, Jeff 
 who the hell is this bozo? 
 you forward this to wolfe, belden & co.? 
 now i'm really jealous.  let me see what i can muster up for you on tuscany. o, jealous am I. 
 I think we need to be careful about broadcasting every rumor floating around to an email list of this size.  Just a thought.    Mary Hain@ECT 12/14/2000 02:51 PM 
 no problem.  we're cancelling the meeting.    Sandra McCubbin 12/14/2000 02:51 PM 
 FYI.  Here's the release that I referenced yesterday evening. ?          CONTACT:  Armando Rend?n December 13, 2000 CPUC: 103 ? 415-703-1366  abr@cpuc.ca.gov ?  CPUC PRESIDENT LYNCH AND COMMISSIONER DUQUE STATEMENT California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Henry Duque today issued a statement regarding revisions to item 8 on the Commissioner agenda of December 21, 2000: We note certain revisions to the Commission's published agenda for December 21st. Item 8 has been revised to reflect the scope of options available to the Commission in addressing current financial conditions facing Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. The financial problems faced by California's utilities are the result of the failure of the wholesale electric market to ensure just and reasonable prices for this necessity. The Commission need not act on this agenda item on December 21st, but the fact that it is on our agenda allows the Commission to act if necessary. The financial stability of California's utilities is of paramount importance to California, and to this Commission. The CPUC stands ready to act to protect the financial viability of California utilities. The exorbitant and unjustified prices now being charged in California's electricity market demonstrate the necessity for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to intervene and control the opportunism of the electricity sellers. FERC must act to solve the underlying market failure so that all energy consumers are assured of reliable delivery of power and protected from exorbitant energy costs. We urge FERC to act immediately. For information on this item, please contact Harriett Burt, Deputy Chief of Staff for Loretta Lynch at 415-703- 2444, Mary Lou Tousey, 415-703-2593, or Commissioner Carl Wood, 415-703- 2440. ### 
 you will be on call, correct? 
 Since I'm in S.F., I assume that I'll be able to call in by phone? 
 Jeannie:  there are currently  8,300 MWs worth of applications submitted and awaiting approval for construction from the CEC. 
 get rid of him. 
 And the same to you.  Sorry you didn't make to have a beer after the final. See you at MPAR in January.  Have fun catching up on your sleep and laying around a little bit.  Best, Jeff 
 Only the presidential election was more bizarre!  I have my fingers crossed that a Republican administration will help.  In any case, it's a welcome change of pace.  Hope you're well out there.  Best, Jeff 
 Here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece.  One general comment:  It may be a bit lengthy at this point.  Also, have we decided whether it would be our op-ed piece?  And one key point that is very commercially sensitive:  The term "end the rate freeze" has very ominous implications for EES's book, depending on the timing of any such "end" in California.  Thus my heavy-handed edits on that portion.  Nice job, Jeannie.  Best, Jeff 
 can you talk to sandi?  she's on vacation beginning on monday.  the idea wa= s=20 that she and i should get together before she left (based on the call we ha= d=20 where Rick and Paul put the ball in my and sandi's court to coordinate the= =20 strategy).  she suggested that it would also be a good idea to grab whoever= =20 was here tomorrow, too.  it's really just a prelim meeting to discuss the= =20 note that sandi sent around and for me to bounce a few ideas off of her. = =20 we'll be having many, many more, and nothing discussed in tomorrow's "kick= =20 off" will set anything in stone.  that said, if you prefer that we wait,=20 that's ok with me. 
 Attached is a letter that we worked on today and that will be sent to the Governor, CA's US Senators (Boxer/Feinstein), congressional folks, and key Cal state legislators.  It's going out first thing tomorrow AM.  It builds on many of the things we've discussed over the past several months, so there shouldn't be any surprises.  If you've got any concerns please give Paul a call at home or page me at 888.916.7184.  Jeff 
 Thank you.  Have a nice holiday.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Please keep this internal and confidential.  Here's where the group I mentioned left off last Friday.  It will be useful for our discussion this afternoon.  You'll note from the comments that it's anything but a done deal.  I'll forward the SF press mentioned in the note.  Best, Jeff 
 Can we try to set up a quick call to discuss?    Thane Twiggs@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/18/2000 09:40 AM 
 1) Is it your sense that the deal is done and that it will be announced at the PUC meeting on Thursday? 2) Would the PUC be required to provide 30 days comment, or could it be effective immediately?  Best, Jeff 
 Bad.  Let's talk. 
 Yes. 
 need to be 12:30    Lysa Akin@ECT 12/18/2000 12:56 PM 
 Mike: Can't thank you guys enough for coming.  It was a great time, and Prentice was really happy that you made it.  Hope you didn't get too much of a headache listening to me play (?) the bass.  Please pass along thanks to Lisa, and no reciprocation needed.  Great to have you.  Happy holidays.  Best, Jeff    Mike Herring <mherring@myfamilyinc.com> 12/18/2000 12:12 PM

 thanks.

 Jennifer:  With respect to FERC's ruling from Friday, I'll forward to you what's been forwarded to me.  With respect to the governorn's plan, the one that you forwarded along from EES' customer is definitely one of the more extreme scenarios we've been hearing, but with Davis, I wouldn't rule anything out. If I hear anything, I'll report back.  Best, Jeff    Jennifer Rudolph@EES 12/18/2000 05:03 PM 
 The haircut notion, I believe, arises from Edison's claim that the PX price includes a capacity payment, particularly when demand (i.e., the price) is higher.  I think there's discussion of it in the proposed decision that came out some time ago and which sits in "hold" limbo on the Commission's agenda. I've attached it.  Alan could you see if it's included in the decision?  If not, I can poke around more.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff     Alan Comnes@ECT 12/18/2000 03:59 PM 
 Steve:  Here's the info for tomorrow's call.  Thanks for making the time.  Talk to you then.  Best, Jeff  12:00 CDT Call with Dick Anderson (EBS Tax), Steve Bowen and Dan Clearfield re:  using a c-corp vs. an LLC for   our CLEC  1-888-311-9051  passcode:  60396 
 FYI.  Just learned that California's key small consumer group, TURN, will be sending a letter to the PUC saying that it would be a violation of due process to issue on Thursday the sorts of orders the PUC is comtemplating without first giving folks a chance to comment. 
 Just got off the call with the California stakeholders. The group's trying to come up with a solution and today's call was a challenge.  Edison threw new demands on the table that effectively ended any chance for a deal today.  Appears that at this point that anything more than a 10% rate increase is out of the question politically for the Governor, and the utilities are very unhappy about it.  Consumer groups are already balking publicly at the 10% increase reported in the press.  The meeting effectively ended when Edison announced that, in response to New West turning back their customers, Edison plans to file a proposal with the Commission this week that would require all returning customers to pay the spot price for energy.  The large customer groups blew their tops and that pretty much ended the call.  The group agreed to meet again on Friday, after the PUC business meeting on Thursday.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the effort.  Not looking so great.  We should keep plugging away, however.  Trucks with bullhorns?  Best, Jeff 
 don't even worry about it.  i didn't feel jumped on at all.  the debate has turned about 100% political with very little rational economic thought present, unfortunately. 
 Thanks.  These are the portions of the deal that I've been highlighting as problematic for us with the settlement group for  the past few weeks.  The group knows that unless there's some compromise on these points in a way that directly addresses our concerns, we won't be signing anything.  After yesterday's call, at which Edison blew the meeting up, there's no deal in sight in the immediate term.    Scott Stoness@EES 12/19/2000 08:47 AM

 PG&E's $2 Billion Power Grab We've been gulled by our greedy utility Ken Garcia Thursday,?September 14, 2000 ,2000 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/09/14/T Z110687.DTL SAN FRANCISC -- The executives at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. sure try hard to live up to their name, because I can't think of any company that has been more adept at giving consumers a jolt. The doyens of greed that rule over the California utility giant recently revealed that they hope to pass on to customers more than $2 billion in expenses -- ``unforeseen costs'' in the euphemistic view of the power company, but unjustifiable rate increases to those of us residing in real world. The consumer-soaking surge is apparently based on PG&E's inability to predict a rise in wholesale electricity prices, which is costing the company about $700 million a month. Yet, as usual, the utility giant wants us to forget all past promises and obligations, a favorite technique of energy merchants who see rate increases as something that can be turned on with the flick of a switch. Lest anyone forget, a utility rate increase is exactly what California's customers were told they would not get as a result of a deregulated power market, which was supposed to lower -- not raise -- energy bills because of an expected increase in competition. It shouldn't come as a surprise that our friends at PG&E were among the prime architects of the state's deregulation policy, which they now want to bend in their financial favor. This is known as having your cake and (billing) Edith too, because certainly she and her fellow customers wouldn't want the utility company's stock to fall. Now, I realize PG&E has been prone to blackouts over the years, but just because it doesn't like the deal it forged and signed a few years back, doesn't mean that its customers should be forced to pay for its lapses in judgment. If you want to dance, you have to pay the fiddler -- even if it turns out to be Nero and the electrical lines are burning. ``It should be PG&E that eats the costs because they made the initial promise that rates would go down,'' Dan Jacobson of the California Public Interest Research Group told The Chronicle the other day. And he's right, even if the state Public Utilities Commission once again buckles under and decides to give PG&E a break it doesn't deserve. While PG&E CEO Robert Glynn was trying to assuage analysts on Wall Street this week that the soaring electricity rates would indeed be passed on to customers, The Chronicle revealed that the state Board of Equalization has quietly been granting utilities and giant corporations billions of dollars in tax breaks. Despite a booming economy, the state agency has inexplicably reduced the property tax assessments of PG&E, Pacific Bell and others to the tune of $5.3 billion in the past year alone. That's a lot of lost kilowatts and phone calls that could be used by California residents. But in the world of utilities, it's always best to leave the consumer in the dark. In effect, the equalization board is improperly granting huge tax breaks to companies worth billions, at the same time its assessments on homes and small commercial properties are skyrocketing. And if you think something smells a little rotten here -- well, it may just be the smoke rising from a lot of consumers' ears. You don't have to look far to see why officials at PG&E are feeling a little desperate in their attempts to pass along their rising costs to consumers as quickly as possible. Because the faster they can do it, the faster customers might forget that PG&E had asked the PUC for an $800 million rate increase earlier this year to help keep the lights in the corporate tower burning. The utility was granted a $450 million increase, even though an administrative law judge found that the company needed only half that amount to meet its expenses. But what's a few hundred million between friends? Yet the funny part is, PG&E officials said that rate increase would actually lower our gas and electric bills, an event that happens on our shores about as often as a tsunami. This energy-defying trick, which I first questioned in February, would take place, we were told, because of cost savings within the utility giant's other divisions. Yet if they were making more money, why did PG&E need the PUC to give it close to a half billion in bill increases? Well, the answer is that it would appear there are quite a few dim bulbs making decisions about California's energy market, and Gov. Gray Davis hasn't seen fit to replace them. So don't be shocked if PG&E again gets its way, and once again customers are ``serviced'' by state regulators to the tune of hundreds of millions in rate increases, no matter how unfair or undeserved. PG&E said it would foot the bill when it pushed for deregulation, and now that it's taking a huge hit for past decisions, it wants to pass the buck. It takes time to build up a reputation for Power, Greed & Excess. Energy companies, after all, are anything but utilitarian.

 No thanks necessary.  My pleasure.  I'll report back with what happens this afternoon.  Best, Jeff  P.S.  You run a damned good meeting. 
 FYI.  This article tracks well with the information we've thus far received and that I passed along on the call this morning. 
 Bob:  I want to let you know that I stand in awe of someone who has the balls to open for someone as talented as Dan B.  It demonstrates that you're one talented guy yourself.  Congratulations.  Your show was great, and it was good to see you.   Best of luck on the rest of the tour.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks a million for the summary.  In the flurry, I accidentally deleted it. Could you re-send.  It's STILL a jungle out there.  Best, Jeff 
 I've been notified that the California Commissioner has cancelled the meeting with stakeholders that had been scheduled for this afternoon.  He'd scheduled it to discuss what the order the Commission intends to issue on Thursday might look like.  It signals, at this point, that the utilities continue to have a difficult time reaching agreement with the administration.  Will get back with more as it develops.  Jeff 
 Dude, you may have taken her charger cord!  She can't find hers.  Do you have two now?  Ditto on your comment re: the man versus him music.  The personality is way, way out front. 
 you bet.  Helps a lot having you identify the interests.  So please continue doing that.  I'll keep you up on what's happening as it happens.    Scott Stoness@EES 12/19/2000 04:29 PM 
 Heres' the file.  Again, we used it, in the end, to justify having the utilities go out, now, and fill 10-15% of their net short position with 5 and 10 years deals.  The group agreed, though there's still discussions about the percentage (higher?) and the mix (5 and 10 year deals?; 3, 5, 10 year deals?)--you get the picture.  The guy from Edison who's been participating in the talks and agreed with our approach (understanding that the percentage and baskets are still negotiable) is John Fielder, SVP of regulatory affairs.

 I paged you yesterday with the info on size, construction start and in-service dates. You get it?    James D Steffes 12/19/2000 04:58 PM 
 Couple of very minor suggestions, and I filled in the online date for Pastoria. 
 I don't have it.  do you need it soon?

 I'll be out the week between Xmas and the New Year.    Lysa Akin@ECT 12/19/2000 03:02 PM 
 thank you.  that's it! 
 Sorry about that.  I don't think that I'm in on the 1 pm conference call.  Best, Jeff 
 Mark: Here's the info  Size = 500 MW Purchase price = $42 MM (sold to Calpine) Permit  status at time of sale = all permits had been obtained  One note:  while we had gas and electric interconnection agreements ready to execute, Calpine told us not to and they arranged those for themselves.  If there's anything else that you need don't hesitate.  Happy holidays.  Best, Jeff

 Paul Kaufman phoned with the following brief report from the Western Governor's Association  "Energy Summit" that took place today.  Paul will follow up with more detail when he gets back to a computer. The governors issued the following recommendations:  California should immediately implement FERC's order issued last Friday and aggressively pursue all available DSM and conservation opportunties. The Western region should likewise be much more aggressive in identifying and implementing DSM and efficiency opportunities. Increase supply as soon as possible. FERC should do an investigation into the potentially negative effects that price caps can cause in the industry. FERC should add to its investigations an investigation into what caused the price spikes in the first week of December. Work with the Bush transition team to make sure that someone from the new administration is focused on the issue.  Hoecker said that he is not inclined to impose a region-wide cap until California takes the actions it needs to take to help alleviate the situation (e.g., reforming regs governing utility forward contracts).

 FYI, I'm having gall bladder surgery from January 1 to February 1. 
 Very interesting.  Quick questions:  1) $100MM come out of our pockets?  2) Could we "guarantee" 500 MWs?  3) Would we identify and implement DSM at our customers' sites?  Jeff    Scott Stoness@EES 12/20/2000 04:11 PM

 We will set up a call-in number to relay to folks any actions the Commission takes tomorrow.  The Commission meeting starts at 10 AM PST, but it's unclear when they will take up our issue.  Since the press will likely have the place surrounded, they may decide to do that item first.  We'll send out a notice with a call-in # and time as soon as we have the information.  Best, Jeff 
 Will do.    Lisa Yoho 12/21/2000 09:31 AM 
 These folks will need to be added to the distribution list.  Lysa/Joseph: it's going to be a bit wacky, because, as the note indicates, I'm not sure what time the call will be.  Anywhere from about 11 AM to 2 PM PST.  We'll need to keep the number of ports as unlimited as possible, because I have a feeling that the note indicating that there be a meeting will get around, perhaps globally.  As soon as I know what time I'll want to have the call, I will notify Joseph, who will need to set up the call and distribute the info to the original list I sent around plus the names below.  If you two have suggestions on how you'd like to handle, like Ross Perot, I'm all ears. Thanks so much for your help.  Also, please make sure to add Vicki Sharpe and Michael Smith of EES on the list, too.  Jeff 
 S&P threatened publicly yesterday that unless the PUC acts decisively today to fix the utilities' cash flow issue, they will significantly downgrade California's IOUs.  I assume that's in the WSJ article Rick referenced.  As Rick said, more info to come in a few hours.    Mark Schroeder@ECT 12/21/2000 08:31 AM 
 From the most recent information we have, the most likely outcome appears to be the following:  As we've discussed this week, the administration and the utilities continue to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 1) how much of the undercollection the IOUs should absorb and how much consumers should absorb and 2) how big the rate increase should be to manage the IOUs cash flow/credit  problems (governor wants 10%, IOUs want at least 20%). It remains likely that the Commission will rule today on relaxing regulations to make it easier for the IOUs to enter into longer-term contracts w/out getting 2nd and 3rd guessed by the Commission. It is likely that the Commission will signal strongly that it will not let the IOUs go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for considering and implementing a "rate stabilization" plan in Q1 2001.  That said, the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically between now and 2 PM PST.  Just talked to two SVPs with PG&E and Edison and they said that they don't know what the Commission will do at 2.  Jeff    Joseph Alamo 12/21/2000 12:30 PM

 don't know.  check out the website, which is where registration is.  there's lots on B2B, e.g., biz models/technologies.  i registered.  if i win the lottery you can likely persuade me to give you my ticket, or i can try to get one from someone who wins but can't go, or hopefully you can register and win one for yourself.  check out the site. 
 Mike (Smith): Since things will move pretty quickly from this point forward, we want to have a quick meeting to explore our legal options and how best to preserve them.  We'd like to have a kickoff call after the daily 10 AM (CST ) call that Wanda Curry handles.  Are you available after Wanda's call?  Say 11 AM CST?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings Judge Minkin:  This is to inform that a representative of Enron Corp would like to address the Commission on the issue of utility rate stabilization plans at the Commission's hearings scheduled for December 27th and 28th.  Thank you.  Sincerely, Jeffrey Dasovich Director, Enron Corp 
 Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission's hearings.  Few points: Our time is likely to be limited to 5-10 minutes. Mike Day, our outside counsel, will make the presentation on our behalf. Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will forward that along for folks review later today. Comments can be forwarded to me via email, pager (888.916.7184), voicemail (415.782.7822), or home (415.621.8317). We will finalize the message points on tomorrow's daily call (10 AM CST). The call in number is 800.713.8600.  Code is 80435. The Commission's hearings begin tomorrow at 10 AM (PST). 
 Nice job.  Going to be a wild ride. 
 That's a very good point.  I'll make the change.  Best, Jeff    Harry Kingerski 12/26/2000 03:33 PM 
 We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.  But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.  OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing.  The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy."  The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.   His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "refunds."  On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.  And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the "gouging" band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.  Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.  He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.  IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.  In the best case, the clamoring for a "refund" subsides.  In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered. In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers. 
 You're right, Sue.  Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion---trying to finesse it.  Thanks very much for the comments. Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned and based on facts and evidence.  Will make that change.    Susan J Mara 12/26/2000 06:43 PM 
 you were on the original.  did you not get it? 
 Thanks.  Good points.  Will make sure that we have "bad guys" issued covered.  You have a great holiday with your family and a safe and happy New Year.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 12/27/2000 09:29 AM 
 Thanks Roger.  Here are the highlights of today's hearings:  Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much. Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion's share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary. Due process matters. If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law suits will ensue. Don't jump the gun. A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities' proposals. The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities' claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets.  However, as expected, the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.  The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4. No more divestiture. The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission should ensure that the assets' benefits are allocated equally among all customers.  One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities' hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation. Treat all customers equally and fairly. The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v. small; direct access v. bundled).  No customer group should be sacrificied to save another. Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch.  As such, the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate problem.  A modest rate increase is all that's required and the Commission should do no more.  At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow's hearing) to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze.  It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can  Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly.  A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.  But they were the exception rather than the rule at today's hearing.  2. Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue through Friday. Tomorrow, lawyers will provide "oral" arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.  We will argue that it does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 01.04.01.  We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should do so while keeping AB 1890's basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed.   We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach.  In terms of legal arguments, this is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking. After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and "all interested persons" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo). When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments, the President of the Commission responded "we don't know, it's evolving."  In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is "appeal-proof." Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.  We continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side. We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.  We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.  Best, Jeff    Roger Yang@EES 12/27/2000 05:43 PM

 Needless to say, given the Governor's press release, I'm a little concerned about what he might want.  Carl Wood and Loretta Lynch were truly abominable at the FERC hearing.  Fortunately, FERC (all 4 Commissioners) really beat up on the them.  I'm convinced that FERC feels that they must do something between now and November and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be bold (understanding that "bold" ain't exactly in Hoecker's play book), now's the chance.  Thanks for the giving Heber the straight dope.  He was very gracious throughout, but after the panel he (very jokingly) ribbed me pretty well, saying, "Jeff, I let you off the hook.  I was going to ask you how in the hell you ever let California turn into such a mess."  I told him that we were exercising Herculean restraint in not making lengthy "I told you so" statements.  Best, Jeff 
 I haven't received anything.    Susan J Mara 12/28/2000 02:49 PM 
 ah jeez, i guess this means that you made it back safely from s.d? 
 Today's hearing was dominated by : 1) many lawyers arguing over whether the Commission must declare that the "rate freeze" is over before raising rates, or whether the Commission can rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and, 1) an appearance by Ralph Nader.  The Legal Issue In general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction.  Whether it sticks remains to be seen, however.  We proposed that:  The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate freeze issue. The Commission will not have the facts it needs, and it won't have  provided the due process necessary by Jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied to the rate freeze.  And if it tries, it's likely to face a flurry of law suits, which is in no one's best interest. For it's Jan 4th decision, the Commission should confine itself to determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the utilities' access to capital markets. (We've taken no position on whether there's a need to raise rates.) setting a hearing schedule to examine the "rate freeze" and all related issues thoroughly and methodically.  The utilities argued that the Commission must declare an end to the rate freeze; otherwise any Commission decision to raise rates would be easy to attack in the courts.  (In reality, the utilities want the Commission to end the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the Commission will permit the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs.  Under the rate freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate freeze.)  In his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past Commission decision and court cases supporting the Commission's ability to raise rates if it found it necessary to do so.  Many other parties agreed with our position.  A few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a call.  During questioning, both the President of the Commission (Loretta Lynch) and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the Commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the rate freeze issues.  The Ralph Factor Apparently, having lost the Presidential election, Ralph Nader's still looking for work.  He showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy news conference.  From what I could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at the utilities for being greedy, and at the Governor for being too ready and willing to bail the utilities out.  Even when thrown some soft balls about "out of state generators," Nader stuck to bashing the Governor and the utilities.  But I couldn't hear the entire press conference, so he may have said things that I missed.  The Next Steps The hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week. Tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial hardship.  Customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively (as does the PUC).  The utilities will also have the chance to question the consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the Commission. On Tuesday, the Commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should shoulder.  More tomorrow on the call.

 All:  Please see attached materials from Steve Kean.  Ken Lay and Steve Kean met yesterday with the Governor of California and his policy director to discuss solutions to California's energy problems. The meeting was very constructive.  Ken Lay and Steve offered some of Enron's proposed solutions and the Governor discussed the options he's considering.  We've been asked to provide--by Tuesday--feedback on his proposals.  The turn-around time is tight, particularly in light of the holiday.  We'll need your feedback by COB Monday.  If at all possible, if folks can group their feedback, comments and suggestions and foward them along to me, that would be very helpful.  If there is anyone else that you think ought to receive this information, please forward along.  Thanks very much for you help.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.    Frank W Vickers@ECT 12/29/2000 12:46 PM 
 The Hearings The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility witnesses. The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship. The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices since restructuring started in 1998. Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and parent's use of that cash for investment activities). Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from parent, bankruptcy). The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings progress. Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by Edison witness. Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to issue its decision on Thursday. At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general ratemaking authority.  Outside the Hearing Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management continue. Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room. Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any rate increases. Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of the state speech on the 8th. 
 Thanks for the articles.  Well, not quite in PJs, but yes, working from home, which is some consolation.  PG&E has said that a signficant share of gas suppliers have stopped transacting with PG&E due to credit risk.  Our exposure to PG&E is huge (both EES and ENA), so I wouldn't be surprised if we've stopped transacting with them until the Commission comes out with its decision on the 4th and we see how the ratings agencies respond.  I can find out first thing Tuesday morning.  And a very happy and safe new year to you, too.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 12/30/2000 04:34 PM 
 Well, I was clearly too ambitious in setting out the schedule.  My apologies.  I managed to trudge through the reading and the document last night, but didn't not get to answering the question.  I appears that this will be a busy weekend.  I've a feeling that I won't get my proposed answer to folks until Saturday afternoon for your review.  If that poses a problem for anyone, please let me know.  I still intend to be the compiler of wisdom, so folks should feel free to distribute when they've got something drafted.  Best, Jeff 
 Steve:  I'm going to give you a call.  Few things: Got your message.  As you'll see from the document, I likely spent too much time over the weekend on the "what's in it for consumers" messages.  Since it was one of the the "to do" items, I figured that it should get some emphasis, but sounds like that may not be the case. I've proposed a template for how to provide feedback on the Gov's specific proposals, using direct investment in power plants by the state as the illustrative example.  Let me know if you think it works.  I have ideas on each, but thought it better to await feedback from the commercial folks before filling out our comments in each area. I'm finishing up a bit more detailed proposal for how the Gov might use "energy gurus" to help on the portfolio/procurment issues, and am also offering additional detail on the need for a "rate summit." Got messages in to Schroeder re: Nordpool--expect to hear back from him today at some point and I can drop that info into the document soon as I get it. Will talk to EES at 10 AM CST to discuss their proposals.  If you'd like to join that call, let me know and I'll forward along the call-in number, which I think you may already have in your email. Have received a few comments from ENA that I'll incorporate.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, have talked to both Stoness and Sunde about it.  Thanks.    Steven J Kean 01/02/2001 07:15 AM 
 Another Utility Bailout Should Leave Us Cold George Miller Sunday, December 31, 2000 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/12/31/E D134916.DTL OUR CURRENT energy problems are urgent and serious. But before the governor and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers billions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more. Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition. But this will not happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders. The original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition out of California -- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every bad past business decision by PG&E and other California utilities. Similarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities themselves. Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize the losses. Following on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from federal deregulation efforts. They argued that the deal they cut was good for all parties. Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit from the plan's cap on consumer prices -- and that there was a risk to them if wholesale prices were to go up. This, they told us, is the marketplace. They were willing to absorb the risk. This was the brave new world of free markets. But markets are never free. From the beginning, this deregulation plan was designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage. Initially, consumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five years. Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want again to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets. At first, PG&E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's risks. Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test. Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a substantial rate increase. The rationale is that the utilities may collapse financially. This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures. During the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America. PG&E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&T, it may be worth something to its competitors. This is the genius of the American marketplace. PG&E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk. Why should the ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk? During this past year, tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various Silicon Valley high-tech firms. Their shareholders do not get the benefit of going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout. The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that utilities struck with the people of the state of California. Any additional payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout. Any prudent investor would ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars. The ratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration. George Miller is a Democratic congressman from Martinez. 
 Thanks.  I was literally just about to call the Portland desk.  You saved me the trouble.  Did they say whether they have any plans to cut PG&E off (from gas sales) in the near future?    Karen Denne 01/02/2001 11:26 AM

 Greetings:  Attached is the draft.  I've attempted to capture everyone's comments.  The only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing comments on the Governor's specific proposals.  That will likely go first thing tomorrow morning.  You'll note that only one of the Governor's proposals currently has any comments attached to it.  Comments on the Governor's proposals are appreciated.

 are you not getting the stuff.  is there another paul smith? 
 I haven't forgotten the QF issues.  Going to weave them into our comments on the Governor's proposals. 
 Thanks for the input. 
 Scott: Thanks very much for the comments.  On the demand buy-down, I should have mentioned that I got a late call from the Gov's office asking for more detail on that proposal, which we'll likely forward along tomorrow morning, with the comments on the Gov's proposals.  Will try to work the other comments in. Thanks again.  Best, Jeff    Scott Stoness@EES 01/02/2001 06:30 PM 
 Likewise.  Hope I'm not being to much of a pain on the calls.   Just that Enron---I'm quite certain---won't lend it's name to anything that's less than stellar.  And I'm sure GSPP would like for the conference to be all that it can be, too.  How'd things go in Portland?  Best, Jeff 
 I understand that we may have no choice in the matter, but  having wtinessed Loretta Lynch's inability to define market power when asked to do so by Joe Barton last Monday, and, having heard Carl Wood declare war on capitalism at FERC's hearing on Tuesday, and, knowing that the likes of Harvey Morse (PUC FERC attorney), who has never come down on the side of "no market power here" in any analysis, is "heading up" the PUC investigation, and seeing Gov Davis' press releases demanding refunds from the faceless, out-of-state suppliers  I'm, well, maybe a little nervous about them getting their paws on our data.  Jeff 
 let me know if you get it this time. 
 Thanks.  I think it makes sense to take out the reference to 15%.  It think the rest of it passes the "front page of the New York Times test," as the PR folks say.  Thanks again for your help on this.  Best, Jeff    kcsmith <kcsmith@gateway.net> 01/02/2001 07:32 PM 
 Greetings Kari:  Attached is follow-up information from the meeting that the Governor and you had with Ken Lay and Steve Kean last Thursday.  Tomorrow morning I will email three additional pieces of information:  Our specific comments on the proposals that the Governor raised at the meeting. More details on the "demand buy-down" concept. Information on Norway's version of the ISO, "Nord Pool."  If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.  Happy New Year.  Best, Jeff 
 At least there's some consistency in the world.....    Susan J Mara 01/02/2001 11:04 PM

 how's the memo coming?    Jeremy Meier <jermeier@earthlink.net> 01/02/2001 11:56 AM 
 This is material that I received re: Nord Pool from Davies (one of Schroeder's guys).  If you want to take a wack at putting together a few bullets on what Nord Pool is, how it differs from Cal model and why it's preferable, that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 1) comments to Gov's proposal and 2) more detail on demand buy-down.  That possible?  Let me know.  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Joseph: please forward this to Scott Govenar and let him know that it's confidential and that some additional information will be going to the Govenor this morning, which I'll forward along when it's ready.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 The Commission closed the hearings last night at 7 PM. The Commission refused all attempts by the utilities'--and there were several--to get information on "ending the rate freeze" into the hearing record. The Commission is attempting to get a draft decision out at 10 AM today (PST). If it gets out, there will be oral argument at 12:30 today (PST), with final decision issued tomorrow at the Commission's regularly scheduled business meeting. If it does not get out, there will be no oral argument, and the Commission will issue its final decision tomorrow at its regularly scheduled business meeting. Anything could happen but it appears at this point that the decision will only address the need for a rate increase (rumors flyling furiously regarding how high the increase will be), with "rate freeze" issues put off for another day in the near future. Yesterday, the Governor of California joined Edison's suit against FERC calling for region-wide, hard price caps. 
 Thanks for the offer Ms Kupiecki, but since you carried so much of the weight last case, I feel obliged to compile this time round. 
  FYI:  From PUC Website:    The California Public Utilities Commission intends to issue a proposed decision in A.00-11-038/A.00-11-056/A.00-10-028? by 11:00 AM (PST) today. The Proposed Decision will be e-mailed to the service list and published on the Commission's website (http://www.cpuc.ca.gov) simultaneously. 
 Here they are.  Please review and provide comments quickly.  I'd like to get this off to Kari ASAP.  Thanks.  Jeff 
    Final oral argument in A.00-11-038/A.00-11-056/A.00-10-028 is scheduled for 1:00 - 3:30 this afternoon in the Commission's auditorium at 505 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco. ? The Commission will broadcast the final oral argument via phone bridge at 877-918-3008, password is 92105. 
 I've had to spend a little time negotiating this AM with ENA and EES, but I'm confident that they'll be OK with this version. 
 Shooting to get you the balance of the info by noon.  Glad to hear it's useful.  Hang in there.  Best, Jeff    Kari Dohn <Kari.Dohn@GOV.CA.GOV> 01/03/2001 12:43 PM 
 Copy of order to follow.  Here's a quick summary.  Does not look great for the utilities.  More to follow.  one cent/kwh charge for all customers--equals 9% for rez, 7% for small biz, 12% for med commercial, 15% for large commercial and industrial only in place for 90 days Adopts TURN proposal for netting undercollection (from rate freeze) against overcollection (for CTC) Hearings begin next Wednesday (01.10.01) to begin address all remaining issues (including whether rate freeze has ended and when) and to set up a timetable to examine the results of the auditor's report 
 Here's a copy of the draft.  - CPUC01-#86861-v1-A0011038_et_al__Minkin_Agenda_Dec___.doc 
 It works! 
 Thanks.  Kari just wrote me an email expressing great appreciation for the materials.  I told her that the rest will follow in the next hour.  You're about to get from me the details on the buy-down proposal.  I don't think that the bankers or the capital markets are going to swallow what Loretta Lynch issued today. 
 Will do.  That glitch in his email address has truly been my nemesis throughout. 
 I apologize. I thought that had been taken care of.  I'll take care of it. 
 If it's any indication, Edison was down 2.75 today.  Not pretty. 
 you get the 5-year block numbers from Bob? 
 Hi Sue:  A very happy new year to you.  Mr Kean has had me underwater since last Thursday night, but I'll resurface tomorrow, at which time we can catch up on a number of things, including bills.  But I wanted to forward along Steve's memo that we discussed just prior to Xmas.  Hope you had a great holiday and that all is well.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Kari:  Forgive the delay.  Much going on today, PUC draft decision in particular. The draft does not look promising for the utilities' financial position.  Attached are our comments on the Governor's Proposals and some more detail on the demand-reduction proposal.  We continue to work on the Nord Pool research for you and will turn that around as quickly as we can.  Again, don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything else I can help with, or if there's anything else that you need. (415.782.7822)  Best, Jeff 
 California Electricity Update 
 in office mon, tues, wed.  perhaps houston thur/fri. 
 two questions: 1) are we having a staff meeting tomorrow? 2) why the heck aren't you in the bonus meeting? 
 I forwarded this to you so that you could have a chance to take a peek at it before forwarding along to the rest of the group.  If you'd like me to forward it along to the larger group, just let me know.  Jeff 
 It's hard to disagree with the fact that 1) the utilities are the ones that cut the deal they're living with and 2) they took all of the "stranded cost" money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and countries.  But you can only buy for 10 cents and sell for 5 cents for so long before creditors turn off the spigot.  Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with the draft decision issued today.  (See story attached, below.)  With bankruptcy, the only one making any decisions is the judge, and while some see benefits to that, seems to us that from a political, financial and commercial perspective, bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves.  That said, we're extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases.  But if the increases are subject to refund, then decision makers can buy themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate increase, which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional opportunity over the next 90 days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems.  Well, you got my two cents.  Sorry about that.  Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** ********************  Late afternoon 1/3/01 news:   USA: Calif utility ratings may fall too far on 7-15 pct hike. By Jonathan Stempel  01/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to 15 percent, analysts said Wednesday.  In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9 percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business customers.  The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday.  "It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled limbo dancers at that," said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade research at Barclays Capital.  PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30 percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy.  The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's electricity market.  On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison International .  PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down $2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at $12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board.  Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds, which in recent weeks have traded like junk.  Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.  The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than $8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state. They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks.  Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk status.  "No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain investment-grade ratings," said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.  The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets because of their precarious financial state.  Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of their loans.  Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans.  Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - "Baa3" for long-term debt and "Prime-3" for short-term debt from Moody's, and "BBB-minus" and "A3" from S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities. The reason: short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings.  "Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a waste of everyone's time," said Burke.  Still, he said, "there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B' ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity."

 FYI.  When I sent Kari Dohn some additional materials today, I mentioned in passing that I thought the Commission's draft decision fell short.  She responded by asking why.  Attached is my response, and hers.  Perhaps there's a glimmer of hope for the IOUs between now and tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's what we've delivered to Davis: Message points on the "big picture" Reasons that the Governor needs to broaden his information network (i.e., get better advice) and a proposal for how to do it Comments on the Governor's proposals Detail on how to execute the "buy-down" proposal 7X24, Peak and Off peak prices for 5-year blocks of power  The only thing left to send is the Nord Pool material, which Jim Steffes is help me to gather for delivery tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Best of luck.  You've got a tough job.  Guess you'll be working that much harder now that John Stevens is on his way to San Francisco.  At last week's meeting, a request was made for peak and off peak prices. I've attached prices that we filed yesterday at FERC as part of its on-going proceeding of forward contracts.  Few comments:  We'd appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential, particularly since the information is covered by FERC's confidentiality provisions.  Since we are not a "generator," we buy and sell in the market, which as you know is currently very volatile. Consequently, the quotes that we provide customers change daily to reflect changing market prices.  These prices were put together and filed yesterday, but you may have heard that prices were down today.  So quotes we made today were lower.   And quotes we makes tomorrow will reflect tomorrow's market conditions and will likely be different from today's.  Because these quotes were assembled yesterday, they are only "indicative." That is, if someone wanted to buy these products today, we'd have to recalculate prices, because the quotes established yesterday are no longer valid (for the reasons I mentioned above).  Hope this helps.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Attached are the final versions of confidential materials provided to the Governor's office.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Sue:  Hope all is well in the land of forward contracts.  Do we know who the speakers are?  Is Dave Parquet attending for us?  Thanks. Jeff 
 Greetings:  Well, hope your holiday was great, because I'm back with more questions.  To change my direct deposit account, can I do that on line, or do I need to do it by other means?  Thanks, as always, and I hope you have a great 2001.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry.  They're on their way.  (P.S. It's Kean, not Kane.)  And I like to discuss further the points you were making on the call.  They were good ones.  I just didn't want to get hung up on them during that conference call.  Best, Jeff 
 As you can imagine, the distribution list has almost reached the size of the entire company.  If you folks could distribute materials to those in your group that need it, that would really help out a lot. Let me know if that works.  Best, Jeff 
 This touches the issues you and I discussed yesterday.  Seems important to have this sort of information flowing well in advance of the activity.  Have you or anyone else had a chance to peek at what Sam intends to present to legislators?  The more the right is aware of the left hand, and vice versa, seems the better off we'll be.  No big deal, but if we get our internal process in order at the outset, likely make it easier when the missiles really start flying.  Your pal, Jeff    Sandra McCubbin 01/04/2001 10:16 AM 
 EES' receivables related to PX-credit payments that PG&E continues to withhold has grown dramatically EES is going to meet internally to re-visit the issue of putting customers back on utility service (but honoring the financial terms of our contracts) They will try to convene a meeting, as early as Tuesday to discuss the switch-back issue w/Steve, Mark, Blachman, Sunde, etc., similar to the meeting held a couple of weeks ago Given the market's negative response to the Commission's decision, EES will immediately try to tie up bankruptcy counsel in anticipation of the fact that the utilities may be forced to file, which EES estimates will occur by end of next week, if it happens 
 Jennifer:  I will unfortunately not be able to make the call because I have to be at the California PUC for the decision that they're issuing today. Harry Kingerski, in Houston, might be able to join, though.    Jennifer Rudolph@EES 01/04/2001 09:46 AM 
 The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared yesterday.  Three key changes: They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the entire "rate freeze" structure remains intact for now). The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's "netting out" of gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to lower chances of a successful utility appeal). The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature. On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in California, to get more info and will report back. The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts. Only FERC was demonized more. Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent "interim" appointee, made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy. The Commission left open the possibility of "doing more" at their next meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is reached, it could end up on the next agenda. 
 Yes, I'll get to Mike Day. 
 Vicki Sharp@EES 01/04/2001 04:32 PM 
 1) Since I'm coming, I'll likely stay a couple of days, if there's still an open seat available on the floor. 2) I can get a plane that arrives at Intercontinental at 12:20.  Can I catch a cab and get to the Woodlands by 1?  Otherwise, I'll come out the night before.  Best, Jeff

 you're a goddess.  thank you. 
 Vicki:  Do we need to add the PX letter to the agenda for tomorrow's 10 AM call?  If so, make sense to have Bracewell (Ron Carroll?) and Mike Day on as well?  Jeff 
 Ron Carrol works at Bracewell and he handles a lot of our FERC-related PX and ISO activity, including tariff activity.  Ron works for Dan Watkiss, who also handles a lot of that work for us . 
 Man, you ain't kiddin'.  Jeez..... 
 Greetings, Kari. =20  Today's installment includes:  Background on Nord Pool Information on the status of de-regulation in Pennsylvania.  The rumors regarding securitization of utilities' power purchase costs had = a=20 very positive effect on the utilities' stock today.  Congratulations.  Ther= e=20 is conflicting information floating around, though. =20  Some wires stories say that a state senator will sponsor a securitization= =20 bill.  Others say that it will be the Governor's bill.  Is securitization= =20 legislation something that the Governor intends to sponsor/support?=20  Though there are clearly some challenges to securitization, we think it=20 offers a promising option.  Hope the information is useful.  Best, Jeff 
 I sent Kari Dohn some more information today--thanks, Jim, for the Pennsylvania info.  In the note, I asked her if the rumors about securitization are true, and whether the Governor, indeed, intends to push it actively.  I also mentioned that we viewed it as a very promising option, particularly if accompanied by significant concessions by the utilities.  The response from Kari is very encouraging, and will hopefully help the utilities' credit position, though I heard PG&E was downgraded to junk by at least one credit agency today, but haven't confirmed it.  Think it's prudent to keep Kari's info very close to the vest--here's Kari'her response:  Jeff -- thank you so much for the information!  Re:  securitization, I don't think the exact form has been decided in terms of legislation, but its fair to say there are very active discussions at the highest level regarding the best way to do this (with good support, between us, it appears).  All major parties will need to be supportive. 
 I hear you.  Feels like I haven't slept for about a week.  Congratulations--securitization would be an extremely constructive outcome. If there's anything at all that we can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask.  (Since folks view us as, well, somewhat controversial, we continue to try to do productive things away from the spot light.)  Talk to you soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. See you then.  Hope it turns out that your guts are in good order. I'm feeling like I could use a transplant myself.  Best, Jeff 
 Hmmm, sounds like the pressure's getting to Mike a bit.  A vacation might help.  I think you're entitled to continue on, if that's your decision.

 Greetings: Thanks for all the help with information.  Here's what we've sent to the Governor. Best, Jeff 
 You ain't kiddin'.    "Lindh, Frank (Law)" <FRL3@pge.com> 01/05/2001 10:30 AM 
 Mike:  This should offer a guide to developing legislation that narrows PUC review of utility purchases to approval of the competitive solicitation used by the utility to procure the contracts.  We have consistently argued against being prescriptive (i.e., the contracts should be of 3 years long, less than $60/MWH, etc.) 
 Thanks.  I'll touch base withJulee at IEP. 
 Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday. Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing "credit receivables" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing conference on Wednesday.  Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.  But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron meters.  Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the "complex process"  of changing-out the meters.  In addition, when CA border gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.  SoCalGas submitted an emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.  It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.  Otherwise, we may find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of EES' exposure.  Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned negative on ESPs as a result.

 FYI.  Today Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel, publicly opposed the "state takeover" plan released by California's Treasurer last Friday, saying,  "I'm not a great fan of government getting involved in the private sector, especially delivering a key commodity to the private sector." (SF Chronicle, 01.09.01)  Might be a good opportunity to try in earnest to enlist Silicon Valley in our efforts to get California moving in the right direction, despite itself.  Barrett said the answer is easing siting rules in order to get more power on line sooner and blamed officials who've opposed power plants for seriously exacerbating the problems in California.  Because of CA' power woes, Barrett said that he'd build new facilities anywhere but in California.  Jeff    Karen Denne 01/09/2001 03:02 PM

Alternatively, since I'll be on the call anyway, you can leave me a voicemail, or call me at 707.884.4608, and I can relay those points that you feel are most important to communicate.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Sandi.  Are the R's generally on-board with Davis' approach, or do they intend to offer their own proposals (understanding that they are greatly outnumbered in both houses).  I'm hearing that it's a mixed bag.  Best, Jeff    Sandra McCubbin 01/09/2001 07:48 PM 
 I'll do my darnedest.  Is Jan handling this poorly or well? 
 Thanks, Mike. About the best we can hope for at this point and consistent with our approach.  Would be very beneficial if we could ride as much as possible in TURN's public wake, and continue to "advise" them and work with others behind the scenes. 
 Hey buddy.  I know that you're up in Sacramento and have a much better lay of the land than I, but this looks a like a sure fire set up for "the man for all seasons" to make an appearance before the legislature.  I have deep concerns about us sticking our necks out at these hearings.  Again, have much better info, but by all accounts, "witch hunt" seems to be the operative term for the hearings.  We are doing very well for ourselves working behind the scenes and the risks to us of having someone at a public leg hearing, with all the cameras, and all the politicians feeling the primordial urge to grandstand are very high.  Let's please discuss this one long and hard before making an decision.  I'll be in Sac on the 16th for an AB 1890 Group meeting and plan to attend the hearing.  Your pal, Jeff    Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 01/09/2001 05:15 PM 
 Thanks, Julee.  Sounds like a good idea.  Could you please forward me the call-in for the call?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Any way to observe remotely?  CSPAN?  Telephone?  Internet?  From a cafe in Paris?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Harry, I'll be on the call and I'll call you beforehand.  Mike Day has every financial incentive for us to have a witness, and I'm still struggling to find the value.  As for the "save the planet" crew....I'm as concerned as you are.  I'll try to make sure that Kaufman's on (who's a lawyer and is considerably more to our thinking than to Mike's, Roger's or Stoness'.  Best, Jeff    Harry Kingerski 01/09/2001 04:18 PM 
 Sorry to hear that it was cancelled.  Thank you for keeping me in the loop. Quite a way to start the new year....  Best, Jeff 
 PG&E is saying publicly (and the news is reporting) that PG&E has $500 million in cash, and it's payables are $583 M.    "Ronald Carroll" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com> 01/11/2001 09:05 AM 
 Run!  While there's still time.  And get on the call with Paul.  It starts in 1 minute. 
 Don't mean to keep the chain of emails going, but given the cameras and the grand-standing politicians (who seem to have an abundance of rhetoric and capacity for scape-goating, and a paucity of constructive solutions or the will necessary to do what needs to be done), seems worth considering the pros and cons of throwing anyone in front of any legislative committees.  We may decide that the pros outweigh the cons and that there's discernable value having our outside counsel speak to the issues of supply and demand in California and the West, but seems worth spending 5 or 10 minutes on.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman@ECT 01/11/2001 01:30 AM 
 Scott:  Could you please see that Sandi gets this?  Thanks.  If folks would like to get Sandi information (e.g., the load curtailment proposal discussed by Gary yesterday), please send to Scott, who's with our lobbying firm in Sacramento.  Sandi, Scott (Stoness) would like to discuss this proposal on tomorrow's (Friday's) 8:00 AM conference call.  Thank you.  Best, Jeff    Scott Stoness@EES 01/11/2001 08:26 AM 
 Thanks, Karen.  And please thank Marathon for the info.  If this holds true, sounds like Burton plans to make things pretty messy.    Karen Denne 01/10/2001 09:31 PM 
 also, diablo is also running (reportedly) at about 10% of capacity due to rough seas and difficulties that causes for cooling. 
 Not the retained assets case---Wood wants to cap prices to QFs.  Jeanne, could you try to get any information you can from PUC staff on how they intend to handle PG&E's advice letter  re: "we've stopped selling power from out retained assets into the PX?"  (I'm assuming that the PUC would be sympathetic, since it should immediately lower the utility's bill for power?)  Thanks very much, Jeff 
 You know, generally, when I'm up in the morning, hanging around, getting=20 ready to start the day, I can't see any reason to put clothes on.  I am muc= h=20 more comfortable that way.  Always been that way.  Good goal.  It would be easiest for me to have the meeting in SF.  Next=20 week's fine for me.  Monday's a day off for me.  You?  Or we could set=20 something up in the morning next week.  Just let me know. 
 P.S.  Nice use of "birthday" as the segue to the deal. =20  Speaking of birthdays, Prentice has informed me that, despite my=20 protestations (being a very low-key sort of guy), there "must" be some part= y=20 for my birthday this year (which I'm still opposed to--and I may be in=20 Houston that MONTH anyway). =20  I was thinking (cuz I hate spotlights), that it might be fun and interestin= g,=20 since your Dad and I are both hitting interesting birthdays this year, if w= e=20 had a joint party---double the people, double the fun.  (I don't know if he= 'd=20 rather have a solo party for his, though.)  And since my dad's met your dad= ,=20 but our mom's ain't been in the mix,  I though it might be a good (and=20 hopefully safe) atmosphere to get them together in. =20  Am I smoking crack on the whole idea?

 Greetings Mark:  Any interest?  Best, Jeff    "Daniel Douglass" <Douglass@ArterHadden.com> 01/11/2001 03:18 PM 
 Yes, the utilities can pass through the gas costs. They face an "incentive ratemaking mechanism" that includes a "market benchmarket" that they must meet or beat.  The benchmark's a composite of spot indeces.  So as long as they buy spot, they can meet the benchmark and pass everything through. (Ill-conceived procurement incentive, particularly in these days when prices are going north, but at least there's no price cap creating gas undercollections like there is on the electric side.)  If you need anything else, just holler.  Jeff    James D Steffes 01/11/2001 06:25 PM 
 FYI. 
 Hi.  How's things?  Long time no see. 
 Sort of a single-minded focus. 
 Harry: Tamara Johnson left me a voicemail stating that 1) she phoned Bob Weisenmiller requesting that he be our witness 2) there was disagreement internally about whether Enron should have testimony 3) she nonetheless wanted to try to make sure Bob was available and 4) she would call Bob back to discuss further on Tuesday.  Not sure that this is the best way to run a railroad. As you mentioned, it's quite inefficient to have EES folks contacting our lawyers and reg consultants directly.  I did not respond to Tamara's message--thought it would be better to pass along info to you.  We can discuss further on Tuesday.  Best, Jeff    JMB <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 01/12/2001 04:33 PM 
 FYI.  Report from California's IPP trade association. 
 Of course, I'd love to hear that I made if off the waiting list.  Could it be true?  Could you let me know.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff    IzioSystem@convene.com 01/15/2001 06:55 PM

 Greetings:  See attached "meeting notice."  This could be a good opportunity to get our demand-side proposal on the table.  Dennis:  If we could get some power point slides together, we could present our ideas to this group and the leg aides mentioned.  Let me know your thoughts.  Also attached is a summary of the bill that the CA Assembly passed today. Please pass this along to others who might be interested. Thanks.  Jeff 
 likely to go up, but whether it goes up by enough is unclear.  They've got a very long way to go if they hope to keep the IOUs from filing Chapter 11. 
 i'll give you a call today. 
 you're alive.  thank god.  i was wondering.  be great if you would call some time so that we could guffaw about all of this.  it is rich.  very rich. 415.782.7822.  hope that you and yours are well.  that should have listened to us.  (hee hee)  best, jeff 
 I agree with Harry.  In particular, we'll need to make Richard Sanders and ENA's outside counsel are aware.  I have been concerned, and continued to be concerned about, the implications of being in the case, understanding that our interests--and the stakes--are very high.  Continues to seem important that we be in, but we'll need to discuss further, and make sure that Jim and ENA's attorney's are in the loop.  Best, Jeff    Harry Kingerski 01/18/2001 08:46 AM

I'll have it to you as soon as I get back into town.  Apologies.    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 01/18/2001 04:04 PM 
 Someone from Parquet's group is very likely to be there.  Government Affairs hadn't planned to intend. I can give Parquet a call and find out and make sure that there's good coordination with Transwestern.  Or TW can call him directly.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff

 Dean Tyson:  It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet y= ou=20 and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I=20 wanted to summarize where we left off at today=01,s meeting regarding Calif= ornia=01, s energy crisis.  That summary is attached.  I've also attached three=20 articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolst= er=20 our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meetin= g.  Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy = is=20 a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, it= =20 appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that succes= s=20 requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.= =20 The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed th= at=20 all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot.= =20 Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of=20 success and is greatly appreciated. =20  My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made a= t=20 the meeting.  It represents a =01&first cut,=018 it will undoubtedly change= as the=20 details get worked out, and I=01,m sure I=01,ve missed something.  So pleas= e don=01,t=20 hesitate to edit the draft.  Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal= =20 internally.  As such, I can=01,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the= =20 proposal.  But I=01,m confident that the company can support something akin= to=20 this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.  In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has playe= d=20 a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and=20 analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort a= s=20 well.  Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washingt= on=20 D.C. office.  If she can help in any way, please don=01,t hesitate to let m= e=20 know.  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to= =20 discuss things further.  My home phone is 415.621.8317.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm greatly indebted.  Thank you.    Teresa Janus <tj@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 01/19/2001 06:53 PM 
 Thanks.  Was in Sacramento all week watching the machinations.  I'll give you a call this week.  Best to you and yours.  Jeff    "McNally Temple Associates, Inc." <rmcnally@cwo.com> 01/19/2001 03:55 PM 
 Thanks so much for the info.  This is very useful.  I will try to make the next meeting.  Hopefully the crisis out here will be over by then.  How would you structure it differently next time?  Best, Jeff    Enron Energy Services 
 Yes, we can.  Others are considering doing the same.  Let's discuss on Monday.    Leslie Lawner 01/18/2001 01:18 PM 
 will do.    Steven J Kean 01/21/2001 03:49 PM 
 Leslie, if it's at all possible for you to assist by coordinating with Mike Day and his office, that would be immensely helpful.  If not, no worries. Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Leslie Lawner 01/22/2001 11:17 AM 
 Thoughts? 
 I really apologize, but is there any way you could talk to Keith? 
 Ain't talked to him.  His number is 415.765.8408.  Thanks so much. 
 Dean Tyson: Attached is the proposal.  Your comments are welcome and appreciated.  I'd be happy to input any that you might have prior to forwading to Secretary Summers.  Phil and I will have a list of potential contacts from the business community to review in the next couple of hours.  If you need anything, don't hesitate to contact me.  Perhaps you and Phil and I could touch base later today or this evening to talk about next steps.  Thanks again for your efforts.  Best, Jeff    415.782.7822 pager: 888.916.7184 
 Few things: Linda:  Thanks very much for the call and the help.Tyson is calling John Doer (sp?) to try to get him in the loop. And she agreed to send the proposal to Summers today.  Proposal to follow. I'm working with a guy named Phil Verleger (MIT economist type who worked in Ford and Carter), who I met at the meeting on Saturday, to come up with a list of individuals with Democratic, contributor, business community credientials that can be contacted to seek support for the proposal.  Any suggested contacts that folks have would be helpful. John Nesslage (who works for Jim) is running some numbers to get an idea of the size of rate increases required to pay back the loans under a 10-year term structure The UC  Berkeley econ/biz school faculty members I met with on Saturday want to issue a press release stating there view on "what not to do" (i.e., don't have the state take over anything, period).  They want to give us a copy to review for comments/edits before they issue it.  I should be getting tonite or first thing in the AM tomorrow.  May not go anywhere, but I told them that I'd be happy to review it.  Jeff 
 Congratulation, Pat. And the very best of luck.  See you soon.  Best, Jeff 
 you alive? 
 In office all week.    Joseph Alamo 01/22/2001 07:53 PM 
 go ahead and copy from this and give it a go.  you will get a few returns, but the rest should go.  if it completely crashes on you, let me know.  and thanks for the summaries and updates.  please keep them coming.  what's your cell phone #?best, jeff 
 what time? 
 David: Great start.  My biggest comment: needs to be shorter (thank the attention span of the press and the political process for that).  I talked to Phil. He's got an editor that he works with who can help.  I recommend that we have the editor try to boil it down to an "editorial" size piece.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Tyson has gotten a call-back from the governor's office.  She's going to call him back shortly to try to sell him on the plan (i.e., private sector to the rescue) and ensure that he'll come to the party.  She'll call me back as soon as she talks to him.  Curious--do we have any sense of whether there's much activity within the adminstration on this, or can we expect the wait and see approach to continue? Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  FYI:  Tyson will also be at Davos.  Suggested list of business leaders to try to bring on board to follow.    Linda Robertson 01/23/2001 03:16 PM 
 Though I didn't have a problem with the course agenda, I'm comfortable with the alternative. 
 great idea. 
 give a call. 415.782.7822. 
 Leslie:  Jeff and Susan might be able to help with the pipeline charges. Susan:  I'm not ignoring you.  Of course I'll come.  Give me a call and let's figure out a date for me to address your illustrious group.  Jeff:  How's married life treating you.  Leslie:  Sorry for all the extraneous babbling.  Best, Jeff    Leslie Lawner 01/23/2001 03:20 PM

 Is there any migration risk, i.e., can customers choose in Connecticutt? That will be one of the first questions. 
 I forgot Bank of America:  Hugh L. McColl, Jr., Chairman and CEO 
 John Nesslage have any luck coming up with what sort of $/kwh we'd be looking at with a private sector bailout? 
 Here's the suggested list of business leaders to try to bring into the deal. All comments are welcome and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the list.  Comments? 
 I'm going to go ahead and send it to her. 
 Michael Tribolet:  In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass through the power purchase costs to customers.)  The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to us to make a copy for ourselves.  Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have that filing passed around to this distribution list.  Best, Jeff 
 Mary Beth: Thanks very much for passing these along to Laura Tyson.  There are two documents.  One is a word file with a suggested list of business leaders that we might bring into the discussions.  Please let the Dean know that it's a first cut and that all comments, suggestions, edits, etc. to the document are welcome and appreciated.  The second is a pdf file from Credit Suisse First Boston giving CSFB's analysis of what's going on in California.  I think it provides further proof that California is still looking for, and ought to be very receptive to, a proposal like the one that we're working on.  Could you let me know that you've received this?  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff  - powerpolitics012301.pdf

 Dear Gang: I don't know about you folks, but I woke up to over 100 emails from Telecom Reports today.  It seems to border on spam at this point.  Is anyone else having this experience?  The info is very valuable, but I'm wondering if there's a way to get, say, 3 emails a day rather than the 50 or more I'm currently receiving.  Wondering if the lights will stay on today, Jeff    Margo Reyna 01/24/2001 09:20 AM 
 Are we talking 10 hours worth of work for this pleading?  If so, then $2500 seems good. 
 Got it.  Thanks.  I'll be sending mine around later this afternoon.  Best, Jeff 
 in the attempt to delete the millions of emails i've received from Telecom Reports, i deleted your Western Gov update before reading it.  could you resend?  your pal, jeff 
 will do.  thought that you were already on.

 let's talk about these notes prior to your drafting.  please give me a call. 
 Mary Beth:  For what it's worth, I've read this, and if Laura Tyson or Larry Summers sign it, I have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward (understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager).  While I don't disagree with the language, it is strong and therefore very likely to make the Governor and his staff very uncomfortable.  I would recommend that they do not sign.  Best, Jeff 
 I don't envy your position.  At some point, the document must be finished and folks need to determine whether they'll sign or not.  I greatly admire Rich Gilbert, but his comments (re: regulatory intervention is a good thing, and now this one) will surely create considerably controversy and could greatly upset the apple cart altogether.  Best of luck, Jeff  Talked to Tyson.  She's really working it, which is great, and I continue to focus my efforts there.  My company is squarely behind her efforts.  Thanks again for organizing the meeting last weekend.    "Richard J. Gilbert" <gilbert@econ.Berkeley.EDU> 01/24/2001 01:03 PM 
 Greetings.  Looks like our questions (2&3) are linked.  You around to chat for a couple of minutes?  I'll likely eyeball the numbers to see what cash gives in order to answer #3.  Let me know.  Hope all's well.  Best, Jeff 
 Haven't received anything.  Sounds like we all agree that it would be a good idea to do it.  I'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us the file.  My preference (in order to actually learn something--i'm sort of thick) is to work on these jointly rather than have one person do it each week, but i'm willing to discuss.  others have views on how we ought to write 'em up?  Best, Jeff    "Mark Guinney" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 01/24/2001 09:06 AM 
 Prof. Bajaj.  Our understanding is that we'll need the electronic file you talked about on Monday in order to do the first (optional) case (re: helpful questions and spreadsheets).  But we haven't received the file yet.  Could you possibly forward it to us?  We're leaning strongly toward writing the first case up and turning it in and are anxious to get started.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Tyson has had conversations with the Governor's office. The Governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would "look like"/attendees, and has said that the idea sounds like one worth pursuing (but as we know, talk is very cheap with this Governor). In response, Tyson and her very able helper are taking the 1.5-pager that I sent around and modifying it to describe the meeting optics/logistics/attendee attributes, etc. They will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted. Tyson hopes the document will seal the deal on the Governor's participation. In the meantime, Tyson is trading calls with Doer and trying to line up other business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the table.  Any help/suggestions we can offer gathering up business folks would be useful, but seems that Tyson's going to have to carry that water. Tyson said based on her conversations with Summers, he's squarely on board. 
 The way we handled it last time was 1) have a quick chat about it, 2) split up the pieces, 3) once written, pass around the pieces to see if anyone has any strong feelings about what folks had pulled together, and then, for each case, 4) designate one person as the "assembler" of the pieces.  (We designated who would be responsible for which cases at the beginning of the semester.)  And yes, all by email (save for, say, the preliminary chat).  It worked well.  But I'm flexible, if folks want to try another angle.  Best, Jeff    "Mark Guinney" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 01/24/2001 12:19 PM

 Here's my cut at #3.  I haven't had the benefit of Kim's answer, but made some assumptions and took a shot.  Likely to doctor it up a bit, but wanted to find out if folks are in agreement or if you think I've lost my mind.  Let me know.  #3 is somewhat at the heart of the questions, so I want to make sure that I get your feedback.  And my apologies for not having gotten you something sooner.  Be on the look out, there is a cold going around that really kicked my butt over the last week.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes.  Mike Day:  please make sure that Mike and Bob are in the loop on any and all filings.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff    Mike D Smith@EES 01/25/2001 01:28 PM

 The speaker introduced a bill that would:  Order the CA PUC to establish a "rate component" to permit the utilities to recover its "net undercollected amount" over a period of ten years.  (Sounds like there may be a haircut in there somewhere.) Authorize the State Water Dept. to purchase power on behalf of utilities and munis. Order the CA PUC to create a separate rate component to cover the Dept.'s cost of purchasing the power. Authorize the Treasurer to issue debt, backed by ratepayers, to cover any difference between the price the Water Dept. buys the power for and the price that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze. Authorizes the State Director of Finance to "accept on behalf of the state any tangible asset of an electrical corporation."  (Presumably the state is looking to get something from the IOUs (say, the hydro assets) in exchange for giving the utility it's "net undercollected amount."  The bill is long and haven't yet had a chance to review it in detail.  We're faxing the bill.  The bill will be controversial and it is unclear who in the Legislature has bought into it, though the Governor signaled his general support for this sort of approach in a press conference last night announcing the results of the power auction.  The Assembly is scheduled to have a hearing on the bill later today.  Will pass on more info as we get it.  Jeff 
 Could you please make sure that everyone in the office has this call-in number.  It's a daily call to discuss California's electricity crisis.  Thanks very much.  call-in: 800.998.2462 code: 4912753 
 steelers = 6 bucs = 9 eagles = 5 rams = 15 (last man standing) bills = 4 panthers = 13 jags = 14 chiefs = 10 raiders = 2 giants = 7 pats = 3 seahawks = 11 ravens = 8 skins = 12 
 I'll be in NY/D.C.  I'm willing to do by phone.  Thanks. 
 We'll have an internal call to discuss this prior to launching any missiles. Jeanne, please have Mike give me a call to discuss.  Thanks.  Jeff    JMB <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 01/25/2001 05:34 PM 
 yep. 
 Joseph:  Please contact these folks and remind them that 1) i'm not a lobbyist, 2) i'm not registered as a lobbyist, and 3) i don't qualify as a lobbyist.  thanks a million.  Jeff 
 David:  Accusing market participants of "gaming," "strategic behavoir," "market manipulation," and the like will be extremely controversial, and, I believe, unconstructive.  As you may or may not know, much of the criticism was placed on the utilities strategic bidding on the demand side, which many "economists" and "consultants" seem quite willing and able to conveniently ignore.  Jeff 
 yes. 
 I'll put my mind to it (what's left of it). 
 Tomorrow morning (Saturday), I'll take a whack at building on what Mark's done and distribute to everyone.  FYI,  I'm in New York on Monday so won't be in class.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Here's the case with 1,3 and 4 compiled.  I took some editorial license with 1 and 4--hope I didn't butcher what you were conveying Jimmie and Dylan.  Check it out.  Still need to determine if folks are comfortable with my conclusion in #3, i.e., look, the biz model and the info provided in the 10K may be crap, but from a strictly technical perspective, Patten's justified in using the sales as opposed to the installment method.  Let me know.  Kim's up and running on #2.  Best, Jeff 
 I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.  I'm giving a talk at Exnet on Monday about California.  Attached is a draft of the slides.  All comments welcome and appreciated.  I'm continuing to work on it.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 One of the things that came out of the meeting I was at on Saturday with the UC economists (including Tyson and Yellen) was a "manifesto" that they published today (I'll have the final to distribute soon).  They're having a press conference in about 10 minutes at Berkeley.  In anticipation, they're quoted in a story in today's LA Times (that features Greenspan's comments) and they focus their quotes on the need to raise rates.  Most of these folks in the group, lamentably, earn their living by consulting for incumbents, but there message here should be helpful, and there are a few "right-minded" economists in the bunch.  (I managed to get Dr. Michaels in the group, who was a great voice of reason in the debate over what to say in the manifesto.) It wasn't appropriate for me to play a visible role in the design of the manifesto, though I attempted to offer some behind the scenes suggestions.  Jeff 
 Apologies.  I can't keep track of all the distribution lists.  Please let me know if you think that this will be helpful in your neck of the woods.  Rick relayed Summers comments re: Tyson.  Best, Jeff  P.S. I'm forwarding to David Lugar 
 FYI.  Please let me know if you receive. 
 Dan:  How's things?  Happy New Year.  Hope all's well with you and yours.  Could you please copy us on the UI details?  They will be very useful in what we're up to out here in electricity Disneyland.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff    Elizabeth Linnell 01/26/2001 12:24 PM 
 Oh, please do fax.  415.782.7854.  And we need some more details (in addition to what Jim did) if possible.  thanks. 
 i'll be there. 
 check it out.  i've taken a stab at compiling 1, 3 and 4.  folks comfortable with my conclusion regarding sales v. installment method?  best, Jeff 
 Thank you SO much.  Have a great weekend. 
 FYI. 
 One note: recall that with respect to market manipulation, one of the most common accusations focused on the problems caused by the PX manipulation the utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony (demand-side bidding) market power.  Jeff    Elizabeth Linnell 01/26/2001 12:24 PM 
 please send me my login and password so that i can get into the system. also, please be sure that my account includes E234 and E222.  Thank you.  jeff 
 I'm taking Dylan's and Mark's stuff, adding a bit, and putting it into memo format.  As I recall in class, he doesn't expect or want us to turn in answers to questions, per se, just a 4-page (or so) memo.  I have that right?  I'll circulate the memo later today, or first thing tomorrow in the AM.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Sandi.  This tracks very well with my chat with Barbara.  Barbara's charcterization of "irrelevant" arguably makes sense from a customer's perspective, but it's very relevant to us, though I didn't give Barbara the details of why it's so important for us---just explained that some of our customers, given their contracts with us, would get hurt.  Seems that the important take away is that 1) they are actively negotiating the "end" of the rate freeze, 2) customers get hurt from a retroactive "end" and 3) one "freeze" will the replaced with another, that is, prices will continue to be capped going forward (despite the "end" of the rate freeze).  Seems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze "ends" next month, or next year, which is something that we're going to want to follow very closely.  Do we have any information on where the negotiations between customers and the utilities ended up this weekend?  Best, Jeff    Sandra McCubbin 01/27/2001 08:01 PM 
 OK.  Jimmie and I duplicated effort just a bit.  Attached is the memo and the spreadsheet.  Note that in the memo, we have a dispute about whether $750k is adequate.  Therefore, I've left questions 4 and 5 attached to the memo for you folks to reconcile (if they take advantage of discounts and get A/R and inventory rates back in line with '93 rates, is $750 enough?).  Also, I've included a common-size income statement in exhibit 1, a cash flow statement in exhibit 2, and I, too, completed exhibit 3.  We may want to clean up some of the calculations in the spreadsheet, given that we'll likely need to turn them in as attachments.  Hope this helps.  I'd do more, but I'm off for the airport and New York--won't be in class tomorrow.  Best, Jeff     JcjCal02@aol.com 01/28/2001 01:01 AM 
 Thanks.  Talk to you on the 8:30 call tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 i'm in mendocino:  number's 707.884.4608 if you need to chat.  best, jeff 
 i'll give you a call.  i'm in new york today.  best, jeff 
 Sorry.  I figured Sandi would have included it.  Why would I have figured that? 
 Greetings Professor.  Regrettably, I'm on travel in New York City today and can't make it to class this evening.  I don't anticipate having to miss any other classes this semester.  Regards, Jeff 
 I've left messages describing our idea with TURN and the large cogenerators/marketers/producers, and I've spoken with the Farm Bureau and the California Manufacturers Association.  The Bureau and CMA agree with our idea and I've asked them to "pass the word along" to other customer groups and to try to ensure that its an integral part of the negotiations.  I'll be calling other customer groups and will report back on those conversations.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  No apologies necessary.  I'm in NYC, but will try to call you to= =20 catch up.  When does the Dean get back from Davos?  Have you heard any=20 fallout from the "manifesto?"  I'm conerned that Davis & Co. will be agitat= ed=20 by it.  Thanks a million for all your efforts.  Best, Jeff 
 Those arrangements have been made.  Thank you and see you next week.  Best, Jeff    Mukesh_Bajaj@LECG.com 01/29/2001 12:38 PM 
 FYI.  Teece is the economist at Berkeley who acted as the ringleader for the "manifesto." 
 Hey, nice spreadsheet.  Two minor questions:  1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?  I think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment.  If so, I think they actually get a 46%  tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose using a cash basis.  Still a loss, just not so big.  Anyway, I'm not sure if I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers.  2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?  For example, does shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is now a loss, rather than a gain?  Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same). Seems like they might need a liability like "deferred profits" or some such thing, such that the ["deferred profits" +  revenues (recognized on cash basis)] = notes receivables.  Anyway, I may not have this right, but thought I'd bring it up to see what you think.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm fine and agree that it's more about the reasoning than the right answer. I don't feel strongly about the recommendation, just wanted to throw out something for folks to shoot at and to highlight that A/R and inventory turnover is big problem.  (Though without A/R and inventory turnover convenants, I don't know if I'd do the deal.)  Thanks for doing the finishing touches.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  I'm in the group (and traveling on the East Coast, returning late tonite).  I can do a conference all today if folks would like.  Otherwise, I'll be working on it on the plane back tonite and will distribute when I get home or first thing in the AM.  Best, Jeff    "Sama, Anil" <anil.sama@intel.com> 01/30/2001 11:35 PM 
 Congratulations.  Glad to hear all went well (save the emergency C-section). See you soon.  Best, Jeff 
 will do.    Steven J Kean 01/31/2001 05:50 PM 
 "Sama, Anil" <anil.sama@intel.com> 02/01/2001 01:02 AM 
 No, I don't think I'd make a better accountant.  But I did ask a few questions of my accountant brother-in-law.  You did a great job.  I don't know how much time I'll have, but I'll see if I can throw in a bit of text and raise the issues.  See you tonite. 
 YES!    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 02/01/2001 03:04 PM 
 My proposed edits to Harry's excellent first cut.  They're quick and dirty. My apologies.  Best, Jeff 
 looks like email address for you was wrong.  got returned. 
 PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE.  I haven't read this yet, so I don't know if it's good bad or indifferent.  McFadden is one of the Manifesto signers and a Nobel Laureate.  If folks have comments, please forward them along and I will get them into the mix.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much, Jeanne. 
 Yes, but there's a commitment to reverse it in another bill (AB 27X) that= =20 Debra Bowen is carrying.  There is a helluvalot of uproar about that langua= ge=20 in the bill and just about everyone is united to fix it.  Keep your fingers= =20 crossed, and we'll keep you posted.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi: Hope you had a nice weekend.  Sorry I missed you all in Washington.  Rick's asked me to attend the meeting at the Woodlands tomorrow.  Do we have a list of attendants/agenda?  No big deal, but would help me in preparing for the meeting.  I'm assuming that the meeting takes place tomorrow only?  I'm staying through Wednesday, nonetheless, and have booked a room at the Lancaster.  But if the meeting's going to continue through Wed, I was wondering if I should be staying at the Woodlands.  Thanks (as always) for you help.  Signed, Clueless 
 On Friday, I attended a meeting with Ken Lay and Karen Denne that Mike Peev= ey=20 and David Freeman requested.  Mike Peevey was President of Southern=20 California Edison before founding NEV (which he eventually sold to AES). = =20 Freeman is General Manager of LADWP. =20  The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor.

They are concern= ed=20 that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual= =20 deal, which for obvious reasons they don=01,t want to do.  Peevey and Freeman also said that they don=01,t want to sign too many long-= term=20 contracts though they recognize that there=01,s a trade-off between term an= d=20 price.

I=01,ve summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peev= ey=20 and Freeman:  It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that D= WR=20 is creditworthy.  Response from Peevey/Freeman: AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary=01*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st=01*to= =20 purchase the power necessary to fill the utilities=01, short position.  Ken= Lay=20 pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds= =20 needed to pay suppliers.  The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposa= ls.  Response from Peevey/Freeman: Be as creative as possible.  All offers will be considered (despite the=20 language contained in the RFP).  The only customers who have been protected from California=01,s failed=20 restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct=20 Access.  In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California=01,= s=20 shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site=20 generation.  Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally=01= *as=20 AB1X does=01*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.  Response from Peevey: He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.  He= =20 affirmed what we already know=01*that the head of the Senate oversight comm= ittee=01* Debra Bowen=01*is working on a =01&clean-up=018 bill to remove the prohibit= ion.  In=20 response to Ken Lay=01,s points that California needed to make sure that ut= ility=20 interconnection and stand-by rates didn=01,t continue to impede on-site=20 generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the proble= m=20 and was prepared to fix it.  Siting laws have got to be streamlined and California (i.e., the Governor)= =20 has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants in= =20 order to push the forward curve down.  Response from Peevey/Freeman: The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at=20 expediting siting and development.  DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts=20 supply-side bids.  Response from Peevey/Freeman: They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce t= he=20 signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators th= at=20 DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a =01&reasonable=018 price. = They=20 also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very=20 unlikely to extend the DOE order forcing suppliers to sell to the IOUs.  On= ce=20 they=01,ve shown that they can manage the supply side, Peevey and Freeman s= aid=20 they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding.  These are the highlights.  I=01,d be happy to give more details on the Mond= ay=20 morning \call.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim: Got your message.  Be happy to be on a call today to discuss California's gas structure.  Just let me know when.  Best to all, Jeff    Steve Montovano 02/05/2001 09:12 AM 
 will do.  sorry for the mix-up. 
 Thursday, usual time? 
 We haven't been to the PUC about re-sourcing our customers.  Sue mentioned that this morning.  Good idea to get over there.  Mike's going to the PUC tomorrow to make the rounds.  Is there legislation on DSM and expedited siting?  I haven't seen anything we've provided on DSM or expedited siting-related legislation.    Sandra McCubbin 02/05/2001 05:30 PM 
 Found 'em. 
 My understanding is that PG&E is in active talks to cut a deal with legislators and the Governor, but I have no details.  Mona, does it make sense to have S. Govenor poke around is Sacramento to see what he can find out? 
 Hi.  Apologies.  Things have just been nuts.  I will get you that access code to EnronOnline just as soon as I can.  Hopefully today.  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 02/05/2001 07:17 PM 
 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff    Kimberly Parrish@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 02/05/2001 05:39 PM 
 Hey darlin'.  Long time, no see.  How are ya?  What's the price per magnum? How many am I allowed to get?  And what are the dates for Mazatlan?  Hope to see you guys soon.  Best, Jeff 
 I've heard nothing about any relief granted.  I will check and get back to you.    Nancy Hetrick 02/06/2001 06:55 AM 
 Mike, Jeanne: Have you heard anything about any relief on penalties that the PUC might have recently granted interruptible customers?  (Recall that Loretta has refused to allow folks on interruptible to get off those contracts.)  Could you let me know as soon as you find something out?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 we can all use the tax break that bush wants to give us and give to NPR! 
 We should be able to pull it together.  Mike, I don't have any information about siting or DSM bills.  Could you please add some very brief bullets to your original ones (factual ones rather than advocacy ones) that describe 1) what siting reform bills are out there, what they say, what the chances are for passing, and what the timing for passage seems to be at this point, and 2) same info for DSM.  Thanks a bunch.  Jeff    Sandra McCubbin 02/06/2001 10:15 AM 
 I'll put my suggested edits directly into the document and send to you for review.  Jeff 
 don't remind me.  i'll go ballistic.    Susan J Mara 02/06/2001 12:25 PM 
 Immensely helpful.  Thanks so much.  That's all I'll need.  FYI.  My plane lands at 12:20 and I'll be going directly to the Woodlands.  Oh, one thing. If you could get info to Joseph on where the Woodlands is and where I need to go once I arrive there, I'd be eternally indebted.  Best, Jeff 
 you're welcome.    Susan J Mara 02/06/2001 12:28 PM 
 Apologies. It's quick and dirty.  Jeff 
 Karen Denne has asked me to go along to the meetings tomorrow, which I've agreed to do, but wanted to run it by you two first.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Here are my (very minor) suggestions.  I understand that the plan is to have the letter come from Ken Lay.  Given the current tone and structure of the letter, might be more appropriate to come from Chris, as originally drafted, but I've modified so that it comes from Ken Lay.  Best, Jeff 
 Be happy to talk tonite about how to pull this together.  Can't do it until 8:30-9PM tonite, though.  That too late?  And, if that's not enough, I don't have conferencing capability from home.  Suggestions?  Best, Jeff    "Mark Guinney" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 02/06/2001 10:22 AM 
 Just to add:  Evie represents (largely) the oil companies.  She represented that the suppliers that she represents are negotiating the terms of the agreement with PG&E. She finished by saying that she was fairly confident that those negotiations would result in the gas suppliers that she represents signing PG&E's agreement and supplying gas under those agreements.  Best, Jeff    Susan J Mara 02/06/2001 02:13 PM 
 Thanks, Carolyn.  I can take a crack at the expansion questions, though someone else may want to also take a look at it, just to keep me honest. I'll try to distribute first thing in the AM tomorrow.  Best, Jeff    "Vavrek, Carolyn (US - San Francisco)" <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 02/06/2001 02:01 PM 
 I'd be honored.    Janel Guerrero 02/06/2001 03:43 PM 
 Rick called and asked me to sit in on a meeting on enegy issues that he's having tomorrow in Houston.  Wants me to bring to the table information on gas issues, particularly in light of the SoCalGas settlement here in California.  I'll be leaving at the crack of dawn tomorrow monring and will be in Houston on Tuesday/Wednesday and back in the office on Thursday. 
 No comments.  Chris, I'll have the summary to you shortly.  Jeff 
 Hi Rosalee: Attached is a summary of the proposal that ENA filed today in response to the RFP for power and gas issued by California's DWR.  Also attached is a copy of the complete proposal.  Steve Kean asked that I forward it along to you. Could you please print out a copy and forward it along to Ken Lay prior to his departure for Washington D.C.?  Thanks very much.  All the best, Jeff 
 Told him the proposal is on his fax machine.  He thanked me and said he'd get back to us. He was in a meeting.  That was the sum total of the call.  Thanks for all your help.  Real cat-herding exercise.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks TJ.  Unfortunately, I presumed that I wouldn't get in, so didn't attend.  No problem, though, since the two classes that I did get into are great.  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi folks:  Since we have only one page, the write up for number 4 will have to be very= =20 brief.  Before writing it, though, I wanted to offer a few bullets regardin= g=20 what angle we might take, and let folks respond, comment, counter, etc.=20 before writing it up.  I'll clean and beef up once we've agreed to the=20 approach we'd like to take to question #4.  Finally, I can work from my=20 office on this this evening, which means that I can use the conference call= =20 capability of my office phone to patch everyone in if we'd like to do a=20 conference call. If that's what folks would like to do, I'd prefer to do th= e=20 call at around 7 PM.  Just let me know. =20  Best, Jeff  The question for #4 is:  Stock price is down 23%, significant debt has already been tapped to suppor= t=20 massive growth and covenants on that debt restrict taking on a lot more=20 debt. =20  What should HD do w.r.t. current operations and future growth strategy? In the near term focus less on growth and more on getting margins and EBIT= =20 growth back in line with results from previous years.  (Management=01,s Let= ter=20 to Shareholders alludes to this, but it=01,s difficult to determine whether= =20 management is just paying lip service to the need to capitalize on the grow= th=20 spurt and grown earnings, or continue on the growth effort.)  With respect to funding future (more moderate growth), the company does ha= ve=20 some room to increase long-term debt (e.g., current ratio for 1986 =3D 2.26= ). =20 It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility by= =20 issuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit.  As such, H= D=20 ought to look those sources of funding and fill in any =01&funding gaps=018= with=20 funds from the line of credit.  Given the significant drop in stock price, HD is likely better off in the= =20 near term 1) moderating growth, 2) improving performance to generate cash= =20 internally, and 3) using long-term debt issuance to provide the funds=20 needed.  Once performance and stock price improves, then HD should consider= a=20 stock issuance.  How can company improve operating performance? Reduce selling, store operating expenses and pre-opening expenses Improve receivables turnover Improve inventory turnover Improve per store/sales Consider closing poor-performing stores All of which will improve margins =20 Should company change its strategy?  If so how? Shift from meteoric growth to moderate, targeted growth, and focus on=20 generating positive cash flow from operations Focus on improving performance at existing stores; specifically focus on=20 controlling costs and asset turnover and productivity Consider another debt issuance rather than rely extensively on credit line = in=20 order to decrease cost of funds and increase flexibility 
 Agreed 100%--call me an engineer. 
 Here is the gas settlement from California that we discussed on the conference call yesterday.  Best, Jeff 
 Ok, we're on for 7 pm. i've got carolyn's and Mark's #s please pass along others and i'll originate the call from here. mark, all of your points are good one's, less discuss them on teh call. best, jeff    "Vavrek, Carolyn (US - San Francisco)" <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 02/07/2001 12:25 PM 
 u see my previous note?  sorry, i've been out of the office all day and just got in. 
 Just wanted to send a note to say that I'm very sorry that I couldn't make it to the meeting, miss catching up with folks, and hope that all's going well. Hope to see you very soon.  Best, Jeff 
 check it out.  see george w. and al rap.  very funny, indeed. 
 whaddya mean?  you mean software? 
 Our signature should not be on the letter.  I'll check and see.  I didn't hear back from anyone but you. 
 Gang: Quick question.  Does the lease-buy-back free up $50M of funds for 1987? Mark, is that captured in the 1987 cash flows?  Don't think that should change our recommendation, but ran across it in the case and was wondering if we captured it.  Best, Jeff 
 Yeah, but my name's not in it. 
 I haven't heard  that, but I was running around quite a bit yesterday. Governor Backbone has however been recently attempting to appeal to the Nader (noisy) wing of the party, so it wouldn't be altogether surprising.  We can poke around.  Best, Jeff    Susan J Mara 02/08/2001 10:15 AM 
 I was thinking that it gives them $50M up front (the sale), and then they'll only have to make installment payments for the leases. 
 Sounds great.  When do we sign up?  Best, Jeff 
 "In addition, we are pursuing sale-and-leaseback negotitations for an aggregate of approximately $50 million for ten of our stores.

 No apologies needed.  Thanks so much for doing so much.  Also, heads up. Mark and I are having a teensy discussion about a possible $50 in additional cash we may need to consider (see letter to shareholders, exhibit 4, top of second column).  Best, Jeff 
 I am SO excited about going up and about seeing you guys.  We're going to try (fingers crossed) to leave tomorrow afternoon.  Can you guys bring Annie? (please?). 
 Will do. 
 hi.  how's things.  my cars getting fixed as we speak!  it'll be ready next tues/wed.  I'm very excited about going to the dome this weekend and looking forward to seeing you guys.  can you please bring annie with you?  one small request:  i'm pretty frazzled with work, school, etc. and am looking forward to relaxing and hanging out with you guys.  it would be great to talk about anything other than 1) the electricity crisis and 2) george w. bush.  i figure we can talk for hours about how to get the railing done on the deck!  best, jeff 
 should we point out in memo?  think it's too late to revise? 
 hi jean:  incidentally, you're coverage of the mess via email, etc. has been unequaled.  can't thank you enough.  were there any materials giving more specifics of what the governor proposed today?  thanks very much.  Best, Jeff    Jean Munoz <jmunoz@mcnallytemple.com> 02/08/2001 03:09 PM

 FYI.  Calger is in active talks with Freeman and DWR lawyers about the offer letter we submitted on Tuesday.  Freeman's very anxious to do a deal for 200 MWs from the West Desk and then start talking about a deal for power from Parquet's Pastoria plant.  Credit is of course the issue and Calger's told them that unless the credit issue is bulletproof it's not going to work.  See Chris' comments below.  It looks like progress is being made, but the details will make it or break it.  Any thoughts?  Might make sense to discuss on the call.  Please forward along to others.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm holding up just fine.  Thanks a bunch for caring.  Have a great time in the Virgin Islands!  Is it a Survivor gig?    Susan M Landwehr 02/08/2001 07:52 PM 
 Sandi's on vacation this week.  There are rumors that PG&E's actively seeking a negotiated solution with legislators and the Governor, but I can't verify and don't have details on what the negotiated agreement might look like. While's Sandi's away, have asked Mona to check in with our Sacramento lobbyists to poke around for information.  Will report back soon as we get more info. 
 Neat.    Susan M Landwehr 02/09/2001 06:38 AM

 FYI.  Note that TURN sez that the Commission should use the enactment date of AB1X as the date that the rate freeze ended. 
 Here is the very quick and dirty that I did on the fly for Justin yesterday. You should feel free to edit away!  Best, Jeff 
 Mike:  Please call me ASAP on this issue on my cell phone 415.505.6633. Got an idea.  Appreciate it.  Best, Jeff 
 Karen:  Harry's done some more recent work on the numbers we need to fill in, so he'll fill them in.  Harry:  the numbers we've thrown around over the last couple of months are:  From 1996 to 1999, peak demand increased by 5,522 megawatts, but only 672 megawatts of new capacity was added.  Meanwhile, electricity is growing over 5% per year. 
 I'll be on the call as will Mike Day, out outside counsel who's been helping us negotiate a fix to the DA prohibition in AB 1X.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you very much. 
 Hey gang: I think that we should do the case.  I'm willing to help draft, and willing to take a first crack at putting some bullets together about the direction I think the memo ought to take and distribute that by about 5 PM tomorrow. Though it would be good for other folks to do same and then we could compare notes.  Makes sense?  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  From my "buddy" Verleger. 
 No problem.  Just wanted to throw some thoughts into the hopper. If you've gotten them from Vicky and Tom, then we're set.  Good luck. Best, Jeff 
 Just wanted to let you know that I'll be out of the office beginning at 1PM but will be checking voicemail and will be available by cell phone and pager.  Best, Jeff  PS  I'm listening to the leg hearings by phone.  Legislators are making Bryson and Mission head Al Fohr (Steve, he was the guy at the meeting we had with the Governor's staff) explain in excruciating detail all of the transactions that have taken place since AB 1890 passed (e.g., midwest power plants buys, New Zealand disco buy).  Also interrogating Harold Ray explain Edison's purchasing practices over the past couple of years (i.e., staying short in the market).  Edison's not coming off looking great.  Bryson's trying to do some major triage---and blaming Loretta for keeping Edison short. 
 Hi: Hope you're well.  Based on your note, I faxed my Direct Deposit change to Renee Kelso a week or so ago and wanted to check with her to see that she'd received it and that it was in process, but I can't find her name in email. Any suggestions on how I can check in and see how progress is going?  As always, thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Justin:  As we discussed, this is the most recent version of the proposed "fix" to the Direct Access prohibition included in AB1X that the coalition of customer groups have been working on.  They intend to give it to Debra Bowen first thing next week.  Take a look at it and if you have any questions, please let me know and I can explain the concept and how it is intended to work.  I have notified the coalition that it would be a good thing to include you on their distribution list, but I didn't want to do that until I checked with you. Let me know if that's something that you would like to do.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  For what it's worth, this tracks well with what I'm hearing. Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 02/09/2001 02:19 PM 
 Thanks a million.  Please keep me posted.  See you next week!  Best, Jeff 
 Holy moly and hee haw, how the heck are ya, and what are you up to? 
 OK, it's settled.  We will NOT turn in the case this Monday.  Good call, Dylan.  Best, Jeff    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 02/10/2001 02:53 PM 
 This appears to be a note that was sent a very long time ago and just showed up in your in-box.  I'm thinking it was the decision to raise rates that happened beginning of January.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: My apologies.  I was out of town over the weekend and while I thought I'd have network access, I didn't.  Here's the presentation from the talk I gave in New York on 01.29.01.  I'll be updating it, but will work from these slides (as notes--no formal presentation).  If you have any questions, just give a holler.  415.782.7822.  Look forward to meeting on Wednesday.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, please ticket. 
 Great to see you guys, and despite all the excitement, it was alot of fun. Hope that you made it back safely.  Couple of things:  I'd like to talk to several vineyard consultants, so if it ain't too much trouble, and you've got a name, I'd love to check around. Can I order two cases of coastal zin? What about the champagne?  How much per magnum is it?  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks again for your help, advice and Cristina's phone #.  We'll see where it goes from here.  But I'm shocked.  I called Cristina, and NO answering machine.  I didn't think that happened anymore.  Any way of leaving her a message?  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff 
 On the various matters currently before the California PUC: The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between DWR's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect.  (The order only applies, however, to the power purchased under the Governor's emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power.) The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether, but if the Commission didn't want to vacate the order, it would need to change the decision so that the IOUs don't eat any shortfalls. The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses.  In addition, it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week.  So the opportunity to act and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it. With respect to the cost of utility generation (i.e., retained generating assets and QF contracts), the Commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a Commission decision adopting an "interim" procurement charge on March 27th.  There is another "workshop" scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities' proposals, after which the utilities will be required to file formal "advice  letters" with the Commission.  Those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the 27th. Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that  customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that DWR incurs to buy power.  Everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for DWR's costs and the Commission will, if necessary, raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole. (Unfortunately, the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops.  And until there is clarity on whether the Commission will agree to "pass through" those costs, Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWR's credit as it applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week.) Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays, i.e., the utilities financial position, TURN's proposal to "net out" the utilitities' generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap, the date on which the rate has (or will) end, etc.    Recently, TURN modified its testimony in response to the passage of AB1X.  TURN's new position is that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February 1st, the effective date of AB1X.   EES will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to TURN's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze. We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities' stranded generating assets.  That compensation could come in one of two forms:  1) access to a proportionate share of the utilities' retained, cost-based generating assets, or 2) a credit representing the difference between the "market" value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets.  We are not getting much traction thus far. The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue, the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues against the undercollection, etc. on March 27.  So both sets of issues (the procurement charges and the "end of the rate freeze) are scheduled to be "finalized" on March 27, albeit in separate orders. With respect to the Block Foward issue, our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers.  However, it has become clear that despite those efforts, FERC's decision on "charge backs" will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward issue.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Tom:  From our contact with the Governor's office, seems that Kari Dohn, formerly in the Governor's office, and recently appointed Chair of the Electricity Oversight Board, would be the hands-down best candidate.

 I think that it would be best for the Chancellor's office to make the contact/request, but if you need us to help, then Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro or I can make a go of it; but again, I think that it would best for the Chancellor's office to make the invite.  Best, Jeff    Tom Riley/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange 02/12/2001 02:58 PM 
 Thanks.  I'll take 12 magnums.  And please order 2 cases of Coastal zin.  I think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this weekend.  I can pay you then.  I'm not looking to make money on the grapes.  Just looking for someone to finance the development of my land.  And I'd have a vineyard to look at all the time!  That'd be enough for me.

 On the 21st, Tauzin and Barton are holding separate meetings with executives from the respective stakeholder groups in Southern California to have "frank" discussions about California.  Steve Kean will attend for Enron.  At Steve's meetings will be other gas and electric marketers, and generators.  Linda Robertson would like to talk with us tomorrow about getting Steve prep-ed for the meeting.  She'd like to have the call at 3 PM California time.  Her assistant will be sending details very soon.  Best, Jeff 
 you're a doll.  thanks. on this one, feel free to control!  even if Cameron doesn't go up, prentice and i likely will, which means that we'll be stopping by napa (if you guys don't mind).

 Hi Leslie:  The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to "produce," it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to "reduce.")  That proposal was distributed to the usual, company wide email distribution list last week when it was submitted.  We can discuss further on the phone call this morning.  Best, Jeff    Leslie Lawner 02/13/2001 06:53 PM 
 Some EES folks just popped into my office and asked me to pop into their meeting, which starts at noon.  I'm not sure precisely what the meeting's about, but Mona I noticed you've got it on your weekly schedule.  How do you want to handle?  I'd be happy to pop in at noon for the meet and greet part, but likely need to leave in order to work on the draft strategy---Paul wants me to distribute whatever I've got done by COB today, which I think is a good idea. 
 One thing:  remember we are "cautiously" optimistic.  That qualifier is extremely important, given the lunacy that's underway in California.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  From yesterday's editorial page in the WSJ. McFadden's one of the folks that signed the "manifesto."  Best, Jeff

 thanks.  got it. 
 Hi sorry to bother you, but could you please print this out for me?  Thanks a bunch.  Jeff 
 Hi Laura:  I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities Commission.  Move to Prohibit Customer Choice As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, however, is a provision that prohibits "Direct Access,"  California's term for customer choice.  In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition. Their reasoning is that they need a "captive" customer base to pay for the bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.  Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one choice--the monopoly  utility.  With the passage of AB 1X, they again will have one choice. But this time their only choice will be to buy from a government agency DWR.  A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen (a key player on the Senate side), and Fred Keeley (a key player on the Assembly side), have promised to "fix" the prohibition in another bill "SB27X."  I'll forward in another email the language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry.  Unfortunately, we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of AB1X prohibiting Direct Access, despite the fact that a large coalition of consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to amend the prohibition language.  It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it.  You'll note in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Dept of Finance's concerns about recouping DWR's costs of buying power, and the need to give consumers and businesses maximum flexible in managing their energy costs.  Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California  John Burton, the Democratic leader of the Senate, insists that, "if California is going to 'bail out' the utilities, the State needs to get something in return."  Burton wants the state to buy and operate PG&E's and Edison's transmission system and create a state power authority that would get in the business of (among other things) developing, financing, constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines.  Burton got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his committee yesterday (SB6X and SB33X).  It is unclear how much support he has in the full Senate or in the Assembly, but the possibility of passage is certainly greater than zero at this juncture.  Others experts are offering a better alternative.  When the federal government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties 20 years ago, the federal government received stock warrants in return.  Until recently, the Governor favored warrants, but more recently he has waivered in his statements regarding a state take over.  Burton appears to have negotiating leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it.  Again, it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme move and bad public policy.  I will forward to you in a separate email letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the reasons for our opposition.  In brief, there is no shortage of private capital ready and willing to invest in California's energy infrastructure (i.e., power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines).  All California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract the capital.  In addition, history shows that the State is extremely ill-equipped to become California's mega-utility.  Here are the attachments:  A demand buy-down proposal.  We made this proposal to the Governor (and continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento, Washington D.C. and just about everywhere else).  In short, the notion is that, if the market is willing to pay power producers, say, 7 cents/kwh to "produce" power, then the market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers 7 cents/kwh to "reduce" power consumption.  This approach is critical for two reasons:  first, it provides businesses and consumers the financial incentives necessary (and that California currently lacks) to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently.  Second, because California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to California's energy crisis, its options for addressing the severe shortages that are likely occur this summer are very limited.  Reducing demand represents one of the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply and demand.  Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and "free up" electrons is an investment with significant payback.  A "manifesto" recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a "market-oriented" solution to California's energy crisis.  An editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden, a nobel prize-winning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the "manifesto."  McFadden was one of the manifesto's signatories.  Finally, we are working on "model Legislation" proposing a market-based solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business community--and the Valley in particular--can embrace and advocate.  I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.  Best, Jeff   - Manifesto-final version.doc

 Greetings!  Couple of things.  1) From the notes flying around, it looks like the "word-smithing" of the letter to the Governor continues.  We think you folks are doing exactly the right thing in sending a letter.  We intend to play an energetic and constructive role in the months ahead to help California come up with solutions that make competition work for everyone.  But for a variety of reasons I won't bore you with in this email, we're going to decline signing the letter.  If you'd like to discuss, feel free to give me a call at 415.782.7822.  2) When's the next meeting, and when's the "annual retreat?"  All the best, Jeff

 I don't know if they have the authority, and I could be wrong, but this looks like an obvious set up by the administration.  Hold up a report from your auditor that sez, "it makes now sense to have the two separate, Poolco is the only way to go, and they must be merged."  Then legislation is launched, on the basis of the auditor's recommendation, to merge the PX and the ISO in California.  Looks like an audit whose message we'll want to pre-empt well in advance of the report going public. 
 I'd send to Leff for distribution.    Karen Denne 02/12/2001 03:52 PM 
 My apologies.  I'm going to send you a few things that I need to print out. Thanks a bunch. Jeff 
 sue nord's place.  sort of kitty-korner to you. 
 Greetings folks: I have a meeting from 9-1 tomorrow that I must attend.  Any chance of doing at 8 am.  Apologies for the conflict. Jeff    Julie Armstrong 02/15/2001 08:55 AM 
 I'd vote for 8.    Julie Armstrong 02/15/2001 09:20 AM 
 As he said in the note, we can wait on the tile.  We'll contact our pal karen, the tiling queen, and report back.  sound reasonable?    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 02/15/2001 10:14 AM 
 It's rough, but Paul and I concluded that, since I'll be in Houston, best that I send out whatever I have by COB today.  I will be working on this more on the plane on my way to Houston.  Now we have Sandi's, Paul's and this, all of which I think are headed in the same direction and complement one another.  We'll need to meld them.  Please look at all 3 at the same time. Might be useful to begin an email conversation now with folks comments.  I'm reachable and will be back in the office on Thursday.  Best, Jeff 
 no information is yet public.  you may want to see if they have a website and if there's any information there.  best, jeff 
 Chris/Christian:  Here's a quick and dirty summary.  Apologies that it ain't proofed.  Please provide any edits that you deem necessary to make it accurate and cogent. Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the congratulations.  What is Stormin' Norman asking for? 
 Good luck.  If it's not too much trouble, an email summarizing the day's festivities would be helpful. Parquet ever get in touch with you? 
 Got your message.  Just as soon as we get out from under the deliverables Lay needs for Brulte, I'll turn to figuring how to get Delaney hooked up with decision makers that can make a difference in California.  Is next week too late for meetings?  Best, Jeff 
 Please forward my apologies for missing the call.  I ended up receiving a "fire-drill" assignment that needs to get done in the next couple of hours. I'll try to loop back toward the end of the day and update you on what's going on.  Very sorry about that.  Best, Jeff

 Hi: you taking the afternoon off?  If so, have a great afternoon!  Best, Jeff 
 Happy holiday to you, too.  Is it too late to request that tonite's class (Tasker--Financial Information Analysis) get taped?  Best, Jeff 
 Jim: It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday.  Based on our conversation,= =20 this email includes the following:  An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale, distributed generation = on=20 Tribal lands.  Our views on the impediments to small scale, distributed generation and=20 suggestions on how to remove those impediments.  A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability= to=20 sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20 possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20 order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20 rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I= =20 have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose= d=20 amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable= =20 option.  Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California and the West.  Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-= =20 and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20 office tomorrow detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will= =20 also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our=20 proposed language.  I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m= e=20 if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi= ng=20 else that I can do to assist you.  Regards, Ken    1.

Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20  Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward.  Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue  Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X leaves ambiguous whether DWR has any authority to char= ge=20 California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our analysis= =20 of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the California PU= C=01, s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As such, suppliers= =20 have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates adequate=20 charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.  Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.  Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20  We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options:  Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&XXXX=018.)  Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, =01&XX= XX.=018)  Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that it prefers to pursue the second options, that is,=20 clarifying the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through contract= =20 amendments.  4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001  Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates, a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports showing= =20 that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ only o= n=20 how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All credib= le=20 sources agree supply supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of=20 2001. =20  CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be this summer short by=20 approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our estimates. =20 California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well below = the=20 average 15-20% which is recommended for reliable system operation in the=20 West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than oth= er=20 regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the unpredictability= =20 of the weather and the dry year the West has had thus far.  In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to= =20 this.  Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the= =20 early draw down of reservoirs close the supply-demand gas this summer,=20 emissions restrictions on existing plants, and a reduced number of customer= s=20 who can be curtailed.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at= =20 the current pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies= =20 will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earlies= t.  CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optomistic scenario, banking that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that the=20 California should view the CEC's predictions regarding increased supply wit= h=20 considerably skepticism.  5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis  This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.  As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California cris= is=20 must focus on four issues:  Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency  Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year.  In California, complex and costly air quality regulations=20 exacerbate California=01,s inability to site power plants. =20  The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by:  Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X Because of the delay in implementing a solution to California=01,s electric= ity=20 crisis, closing the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and=20 efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This= =20 can be accomplished most effectively and quickly in two ways:  Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand= more=20 cheaply by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would be= =20 willing to receive to reduce demand for a sustained period (e.g., through t= he=20 summer months).  DWR could very easily run an on-line auction to determine= =20 the best price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To participate,= =20 businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to=20 monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions.  Enron= =20 has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&Dealbench,=018 that = it would=20 be willing to contribute to the effort.  Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment  To work, customers need access to the following key elements:  An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification.

We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs who would also pay= =20 Access Fees could be 2 to 3 times that amount.  We recommend that the State= =20 of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installatio= n=20 of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailmen= t=20 implementation.  Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access.  In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20 therefore begin now to gradually phase the utility out of the procurement= =20 function entirely, with the goal having all customers served by a non-utili= ty=20 provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California should ho= ld=20 a competitive solicitation in which competing service providers would bid f= or=20 the right to serve segments, or =01&tranches,=018 of utility load.  Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative = vehicle:=20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand= . =20 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20 imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers= =20 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ= ia=20 State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend= ed=20 period of time.  California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a= =20 series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20 increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without= =20 =01&shocking=018 the economy or consumers=01, wallets (e.g., amortize the r= ecovery of=20 the utilities=01, debt over a 5-10 year period). The magnitude of the rate= =20 increase can be reduced in two ways: First, the utilities could absorb some= =20 portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted whe= n=20 they agreed to the structure of AB 1890.  Second, California can =01&net=01= 8 the=20 revenues the utilities have received from selling electricity into the Powe= r=20 Exchange against the debts they have accrued due to the retail price cap. 
 Thanks, Christian.  We're including it in the package to Brulte and will let you know how it proceeds.  Best, Jeff 
 Steve: Here's a substantially more cleaned-version, with attachments.  There's a= =20 hard copy on your chair.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Hi Rosalee: Steve asked that I forward this to you.  I believe that Steve left you a=20 voicemail describing the nature of the email.  All the best, Jeff 
 Greetings All:  First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i= s=20 very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this= =20 morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.  Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f= or=20 delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:  I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would= =20 be appreciated. As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20 Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to "wallpaper" Sacramento wi= th=20 our proposed legislation. This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the "final" version= s=20 of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20 believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today. You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver = to=20 his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20 Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed= =20 legislation to the rest of the world at the same time. When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20 determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same= =20 time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will= =20 handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom= =20 you've decided to circulate. This email does, however, include a "summary" of our proposed legislation. = =20 But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20 appropriate language to distribute "to the world," or if we'll need instead= =20 to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a "one=20 pager" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the= =20 package effectively. We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20 proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul= d=20 propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the= =20 Direct Access coalition? We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the = PR=20 machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20 legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we= =20 can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted= =20 Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term. You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR= =20 credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.= =20 You note that attached to the email is a "legislative fix" to AB1X that cou= ld=20 solve the credit issue and an attached set of "taking points" related to a= =20 second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha= t=20 DWR will get its money for power purchase costs. Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to= =20 get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a=20 brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20 (legislative solution) under the topic "create a real competitive retail=20 market in California."  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20 legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20 discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.   If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please= =20 don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.  I can be best=20 reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. =20  Thanks to all for helping pull this together.  Best, Jeff 
 Looks like we'll be staying the night and leaving in the AM.

 I apologize, but I won't be in SF Monday evening, and this week coming up will be a grinder.  I have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend, though. I can provide a fax number tomorrow where the materials can be sent to me.  And I assume that they are on the Izio site, too.  I'm going to go there now.  Tomorrow, I'll try to crunch some numbers and outline the one-pager and distribute to folks by the end of the day.  Then perhaps we can email each other on Monday and try to make some progress on the memo by the end of the day.  That should put us in pretty good shape to finish it up Tuesday and Wednesday.  If I can't get the materials off of Izio, I'll let you know.  I'll report back in the AM tomorrow with a proposed game plan, once I've collected all the materials and pondered things a bit.  Sound reasonable? Thoughts?  Just let me know.  Mark, I hope that if you're in Denver, that means you're skiing.  Best, Jeff    "Mark Guinney" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 02/17/2001 12:04 PM

 Looks fine to me.  What's your expectations re: Freeman paying us what he owes us?  Best, Jeff

 I took a stab at drafting the memo.  I pooped out on the last question, however and was only able to jot down some thoughts.  Caution:  The memo ain't been proofed.  I did it as a memo to the CEO of Timberland, but we don't need to do it that way.  Also attaching files (one each for each of the scenarios asked for, so that folks could see what I did).  Have not constructed the "one-page attachment, however.  Let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff      "Mark Guinney" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 02/18/2001 02:31 PM 
 Since it seems like folks may have only been sporadically receiving my emails, please let me know if you receive the memos and accompanying spreadsheets that I just sent.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Wow, thanks Dylan.  I thought that I was on the hook for this one.  Let me know what I can do to help.  I've read it and will look at what Mark's done and throw my 2 cents in. I'll be working on it tomorrow morning.  Best, jeff    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 02/18/2001 08:37 PM 
 I'm on the case.  I'll look at what you folks did and take a crack at writing the memo.  I'll shoot for writing and sending around at some point today. Otherwise, it'll be tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  I have left two messages on the voice mail authorizing the help desk to delete everything in my haas account.  That should help.  Please consider this email authorization to delete everything in the account. Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 I can' t thank you enough for organizing my business cards.  I know it's a pain and I really appreciate it.  Thank you so much.  Also, I've got an entry in my bank account (EDI payment) for abou $5700.  Do you have the paper for that?  Do I have any other expense thing-ees coming?  Thanks, Jeff 
 thanks so much for dinner.  it was really, really good.  and SO sorry for beating the pants off of you in spades (tee hee).  and i JUST put your check for the wine in the mail!  have a great week.  Best, Jeff 
 yes.  check for 576.29 is in the mail!  thanks so much for getting the coastal, and the champagne, and the opus!  can't thank you enough.  i've also mailed you a new bottle of oyster sauce.  jeff

 Well, this would seem to indicate one of two things: either Hertzberg's is now an absolute lost cause, or it's more urgent than ever to have Ken Lay talk to him.  Given the situation, it would still seem prudent to have Ken Lay talk to the Speaker.  Best, Jeff    Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 02/20/2001 09:12 AM 
 plx check fax (646.8160).  Leg is out.  give a call.  Jeff 
 Be happy to discuss.  My preference would be to have a brief call to discuss, since Mr. Filner is on a mission to tan a few hides over the price spikes in S.D.  At congressional and FERC hearings in S.D. last week, Mr. Filner called generators and marketers quite a few ugly names, fingered them as the cause for the high prices, and demanded that Congress and FERC make them give all the money back to S.D. consumers.  Fairly sensitive item, to put it mildly. I'm at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff  Michael Kenneally@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 09/21/2000 10:47 AM 
 Carolyn, you're a star.  Thanks for the input , Anil.  For what it's worth, I'll take a final looksee this evening and tie up any loose ends (though I doubt that there will be any).  I'll send around to all for one last peek in the morning, and I'll bring a copy to turn in.  Sound reasonable?  Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  I'll be picking Steve up at the hotel and 9:30 am tomorrow morning.  And thank you very much for paging him for me.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Rosalee: Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay.  Mr.= =20 Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding on-going power=20 negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron, but it i= s=20 not certain that he will call.  In the event that he does phone, we would= =20 like to make sure that Mr. Lay gets this information prior returning the=20 call.  Thanks very much for your help.  All the best, Jeff  Mr. Lay:  As you know we've been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme= r=20 out a power deal with CDWR.  The big issue getting in the way of the deal= =20 continues to be credit. I've attached the summary of the credit issues and= =20 possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator= =20 Brulte last week.  As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit=20 issues, Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman= =20 yesterday.  That letter is also attached.  In sum, the letter:  expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit= =20 issues,and, requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and pre-payment for= =20 any new deliveries.  In response, David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment= =20 that 1) we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR, despite your meeting with= =20 Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago, and 2) we would make a= =20 power deal contingent upon a) payment for power previously delivered to DWR= =20 and b) pre-payment for any future deliveries.  Freeman suggested that we=20 could sign the deal for 200 MWs of power now, but then back out of the deal= =20 if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe= w=20 weeks.  Given the political climate in California, we are of course not=20 anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and=20 announce later that we are backing out of the deal, since doing so would=20 place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position.  Instead, we= =20 continue to suggest that it's best for all parties to have the credit issue= s=20 resolved up front.  You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues= =20 further.  As you know, the credit issues are significant and we are working= =20 hard to overcome those issues.  But in the current climate, where the=20 Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of= =20 the electric industry in California, getting the contract issues right is= =20 critical.  Regards, Jeff Dasovich   SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL  Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20  Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward.  Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue  Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.  Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.  Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20  We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options:  Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)  Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20 =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)  Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments.  LETTER FROM CHRIS CALGER TO DAVID FREEMAN  February 19, 2001   S.

 Message Points  Recent legislative proposals designed to have the state play a dominant rol= e=20 in developing, owning and operating power plants in California (SB6X--Burto= n)=20 and buy PG&E and Edison's electric transmission assets (SB33X--Burton) are= =20 taking California in the wrong direction and won't solve the State's=20 electricity crisis. Two new bills are equally disturbing:  AB60X (Hertzerg) would make plant=20 certification contigent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to th= e=20 state at "just and reasonable, cost based rates."  SB39X (Spier) would make= =20 power plant owners public utilities The proposals represent a political solution, not a commercial, financial,= =20 economic or technical solution. =20 As a political solution, these bills will not increase supply, decrease=20 demand, or get the utilities back on their financial feet. In fact, it's worse than that.  These bills will exacerbate California's=20 problems: The transaction contemplated in SB33X is extremely complex, requiring=20 approval by state and federal authorities, bondholders, creditors and=20 others.  California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and= =20 resources trying to achieve the deal, with no certainty of success,=20 particularly in view of PG&E's public opposition.  In the meantime, summer= =20 approaches, and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering.  This= =20 complex, costly and litigious alternative will not lessen the serious threa= t=20 of blackouts that California faces this summer. SB6X would have the state finance, develop, own and/or operate power plants= =20 in the state.    ? Unfortunately, the proposal being offered will not solve the problem;=20 rather, it=01,s a significant step backward that will make matters worse in= =20 California.  ? The reason?

 Three articles that folks might find of particular interest written in the past couple of days.  Best, Jeff 
 Fellows: OK, here's the beginning of the memo.  I'm still working on it, but work cratered on me and I have to switch back to that now.  I'll have a draft finished by tomorrow night and I'll redistribute.  Couple things.  Check the DuPont.  Asset turn needed to be changed, because the pro form calcs hadn't taken the cash out of the assets.  That bumps the ROE up some. See my attached file, I decompose ROE using an alternative method (Mark, the one Tasker used in class) just to do a check, and the numbers turn out the same.  I also ran some turnover ratios for AHP and Warner (understanding the limitations of one year's numbers.)  Questions: Don't we have to assume that covenants will force AHP to dump its divident payout?  Folks likely to get unhappy about that?  Should we care, or should we just expect a rotation out of the stock by dividend-loving investors and rotation in by capital-gains loving investors?  Could we persuade the new management to lever up with an argument that with all that cash on the books, AHP is ripe for takeover?  Anyway just some thoughts.  I'll finish it up tomorrow and re-distribute.  Herr Jackson:  I haven't had a chance to review your comments, but I'll incorporate those in tomorrow as well.  Best, Jeff 
 ah jeez, nobody tell timi and rory....

 Hey folks.  Mr. Jackson makes some very good points, which I'd like to include.  However, before I work them in, wanns make sure that everyone agrees with his comments, since including some of his will require some modifications to the direction that the memo takes.  We could discuss in a brief conference call if folks wish.  Also, please review what I've done--not major edits, but edits (with some questions and additions) nonetheless.  Best, Jeff

 Sue:  The way that I understood what Loretta said, the utilities will not be forced to absorb the shortfall between the price cap and DWR's cost of power. Instead, she said that DWR will be responsible for those costs.  (That ought to make DWR an even less creditworthy entity.)  I'll check in with Mike Day's folks to make sure that I heard correctly and get more details.  Will report back just as soon as we get more information.

 Davis Signals Utility's Grid Could Be Seized Power: Governor says eminent domain is a possible last resort against PG&E, which is balking in state sales negotiations. By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers On the eve of a new round of rescue negotiations with a reluctant Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Gov. Gray Davis suggested Wednesday that as a last resort the state could seize the utility's prized electrical transmission system through eminent domain. That saber-rattling cut against the grain of some rare good news in the state's continuing electricity crisis. The energy supply crunch eased slightly as grid operators pumped up the cushion between supply and demand, and for the first time in more than five weeks the statewide power grid was operating under a relatively mild Stage 1 emergency. Negotiations with the state's two other big utilities--Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric--were described by a Davis aide as going "very well." But the governor, responding to a reporter's question, would not rule out the idea of taking over transmission assets through eminent domain, a legal proceeding by which government can take over private property, at a price determined by a court. His aides downplayed the possibility, and Davis said he intends to continue talking with utility executives in an effort to resolve the weighty questions. "My strong preference is to do this through [a] cooperative negotiation process rather than just seize it," Davis said at a brief news conference at an elementary school south of Sacramento. Davis is insisting that the utilities give up control of the massive system of high-voltage transmission lines in exchange for an infusion of state money that would allow Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to restructure their multibillion-dollar debts. While Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric executives have said they are willing to discuss the sale of their portion of the 32,000-mile statewide grid, PG&E, the state's largest utility, is balking. "The governor would like to solve this thing in one fell swoop, but if PG&E is sitting up there being obdurate, then this thing is severable," Davis political advisor Garry South said in Los Angeles. The utilities need the state's help to buy electricity, as wholesale prices have soared since May and supplies have been stretched to the limit. Under the state's limited deregulation plan, the companies were forced to buy wholesale power at market prices but were not allowed to pass along increased costs to customers. Internal administration documents circulated in the Capitol last week show that the state was considering paying 2.3 times the grid's "book value," or about $7.3 billion, for the grid serving all three companies. A top utility source, requesting anonymity, said the figure was in the "ballpark" of what was being discussed. Talks will continue today with all three utilities. Davis had not decided whether he would join the talks directly, or leave that task to his aides, San Francisco attorney Michael Kahn and former Southern California Edison executive Michael Peevey. "We're still hopeful for an announcement by Friday," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Wednesday night.  Transmission Grid the Key Davis insisted that the transmission grid is key to any deal. The utilities would use cash from the purchase to restructure debt and the state would use its ability to raise money through bond sales to revamp the aging system, which is said to need $1 billion in improvements. "That will be part of the solution," Davis said. "I will not sign off on a resolution of this [without the transmission grid]." South, the governor's chief political advisor, acknowledged that PG&E is in more difficult financial straits than Edison, largely because the PG&E electricity rate structure set by the Public Utilities Commission is lower. But he added that Edison has shown more good faith and interest coming into the negotiations, which began Tuesday in San Francisco. "Edison's been coming into these meetings with 50-page binder books with various specific proposals," South said. "PG&E comes in with a handwritten piece of paper and a big huff of arrogance. They act like they are in control when they are in serious soup." A spokesman for PG&E declined to comment on South's remarks. The utility has maintained a policy of not discussing the negotiations. PG&E's parent company, PG&E Corp., announced Wednesday that it would not be paying its regular dividend of 30 cents per share on common stock for the first quarter of 2001. PG&E said it would not resume paying common stock dividends until it "determines that the financial health of the company will support such action." The company has come under intense criticism that it is maintaining a business-as-usual approach while its utility subsidiary was teetering toward bankruptcy. While the negotiations with PG&E threatened to prolong the political crisis, the state was emerging from 39 straight days of moderate-to-critical power supply emergencies, having been lifted into the relative calm of a low-level alert by warmer weather, improved electricity reserves and a decrease in the number of power plant shutdowns. "We should probably be making a big deal about this, but we just don't have time," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which balances supply and demand on the electricity grid serving about 75% of the state. The grid controllers have been operating in full crisis mode for months now, using everything short of the Energizer bunny to keep electricity flowing while state leaders looked for solutions to the power market meltdown.  Economic Uncertainty For more than a month, the state's transmission grid has been operating under either a Stage 2 or Stage 3 emergency, indicating extremely tight reserves. At noon Wednesday, the grid bumped down to Stage 1--indicating that the state was maintaining reserves at a relatively cushy 7%. That is still below what grid operators consider prudent, but no one was complaining. The full effect of the electricity crisis on the state's economy is not yet clear, and independent Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill urged state lawmakers Wednesday to take a "wait-and-see" approach as they craft a new budget. Still, she left no doubt that she believes the power problems could seriously crimp California's economic outlook. Hill said she believes it is safe to assume that electricity costs will rise because of the gap between wholesale prices and regulated rates. If wholesale prices were to stay as high as they are now, she estimated, the state's wholesale electricity costs would climb to $40 billion this year, up from $25 billion in 1999. Hill made no prediction about whether that would happen. Indeed, Brad Williams, a senior economist in Hill's office, said he thought it likely that prices would decline and that legislation would shield consumers from the full effect of the inflated electricity market.  30-Day Supply Agreement Also Wednesday, Reliant Energy of Houston, which has balked at being forced to provide electricity to California when payment for that power is uncertain, said it had reached a 30-day agreement with the state under which the company will continue to provide emergency electricity supplies. As a result, a federal judge in Sacramento delayed ruling on a lawsuit filed by state grid operators against Reliant. Instead, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. extended until Friday afternoon an order forcing Reliant and several other energy suppliers to keep selling to the California grid operators. In Huntington Beach, city officials delivered a blow to Davis' plan to accelerate power plant projects, filing an appeal with the California Energy Commission to fight the speedy reactivation of two old gas-fired generators. If they exhaust that process without stopping the plan, they promised to go to court. Regardless of whether the appeals succeed, they are likely to tie up the approval process, and in that sense strike against the heart of the governor's plan to expedite power plant projects to meet the energy shortfall expected this summer. The AES units--with a combined output of 450 megawatts, enough to serve 450,000 typical homes--represent about 10% of the 5,000 megawatts that Davis assured power-starved Californians would be available in time for the summer peak. --- Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles, Richard Simon in Washington, Julie Tamaki and Rone Tempest in Sacramento and Christine Hanley in Orange County contributed to this story.

 Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met By Emily Bazar Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. Problem is, it won't work out that way. Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. The Democratic governor's office scheduled an "announcement" for today in Los Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing the state's credibility in the process. "I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem realistic," said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of wholesale generators. "I guess the people I represent have turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. Here's another photo op.' " Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. "I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation," he said at the time. "And hopefully, that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week." Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. "These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight," said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. "On some issues, we are very far away from agreement." Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks with them were far from concluded. Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for months: In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive "plan" by Dec. 1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals. Davis called Feb. 12 a "drop dead" date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach a "consensus agreement" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay. However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. "You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool," Panetta said. The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a judge's discretion. "Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline," Fetter said. "The problem is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers." In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. One prong of the plan: "Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities." Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, particularly to Wall Street. He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. "Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, you name it," Maviglio said. "The governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that." Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets. Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. "You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire," he said. But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their performance. "There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that I don't think it makes much of a difference," said Ed Schuller, a senior vice president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. "It's beyond that point now."

 Greetings Sally: My name is Jeff Dasovich.  The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I contact you.  The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues, and I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.  I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking to you at your convenience to discuss the viability of growing grapes on my property.  I look forward to talking further about the possibilities.  All the best, Jeff

However, my day's completely out of control and resolving now may be more than we can manage.  I propose that I simply delete the one sentence quantifying the value of the shield and leave it as a qualitative statement.  If you folks would like to mess with with it some more, that's great with me, it's just that--and I apologize--I just won't be able to work on it today.  If you decide to do some more with it, go ahead and please bring copies to class.  Otherwise, I'll just delete the sentence referenced above, print out, and bring to class.  Just let me know.  And Dylan, from someone whose surname gets butchered all the time, my apologies for having done the same to yours in the memo.  Best, Jeff

 Cameron:  Thanks for a dee-licious dinner.  (I did steal a couple pieces of duck---curiosity killed the cat---and it was dee-lectible.)  Couple things:  Very, very nice to go through all that to get reservations at La Folie and I of course love the place, but I was thinking that maybe we ought to go somewhere that's a tad less expensive.  I'm thinking that Sean ain't even a big food person, that he's not working, that Molly to bring down a king's ransom in her biz, and Tom and Karen are, after all, vegetarians. Anywho,  it's really kind of you guys to want to go there, but I'm just throwing out the notion that maybe we should go to another place that's just a wee bit less dear.  Maybe that other French place that's just one room that we went to out in the Avenues.  Just a thought.  Whatever you guys want to do is fine with me.  Also, I'm happy to do a "whole family" thing----well, maybe "happy's to strong" (we kid!).  I was actually trying to pull it together last Xmas, but found out that my sister and her hubbie only do their big xmas party once a year, so had to scratch it.  I ain't necessarily all that keen, though, on having all get together--particularly for the first time--with the focus being my birthday.  So maybe we can have another event sometime soon where we can bring the thundering hoards together at one place----Lord help us.  Finally, what's the plan for your dad?  I just found out that I'm supposed to be in Houston for an "all hands" meeting on--you guessed it--March 9th, but if there's something planned for that evening, I intend to tell my buddies at Enron that I can't make the meeting.  Please let me know so that I can cancel Houston in advance.  Finally, and MOST important.  Today is the Man in Black's birthday.  God bless the real king, Johnny Cash.  Best, Jeff

 ON THE GRID OR OFF THE GRID Bigger Is Better An interstate electricity highway could leverage economies of scale to keep the lights on Burton A. Weisbrod, Glen E. Weisbrod Sunday,?February 25, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/25/S C177059.DTL WE COULD HAVE left it to the states. When the Interstate Highway System was proposed nearly 50 years ago, we could have said, "Leave it to each state to decide on its roads and to pay for them, or leave it to private enterprise to build toll roads wherever it is profitable." Fortunately, we didn't. Today, vehicles can travel throughout the country on a system of integrated high-capacity roads that crisscross the nation. There are many differences between the flow of cars or trucks and the flow of electricity. But just as the Interstate Highway System ushered in a new era of easier movement of people and goods across the states, allowing enormous economic and social gains, so, too, do we now need to overcome the obstacles to the easy flow of power across state lines. Many forces are at work contributing to California's electricity crises, and power shortages in other parts of the country also are quite possible. The growth of population and industry in California has expanded demand for electricity. Legislative constraints, reflecting environmental protection and other concerns, have discouraged construction of electricity-generating plants. Periodic shutdowns of generation plants for maintenance have caused short- term power shortages. And, in an oddity of California law, the prices that power producers can charge distributors are deregulated, while the prices that those distributors can charge consumers are regulated and restricted. But largely missing from the debate of what can be done to balance supply and demand is discussion of an effective national power grid that would permit substantial amounts of electricity to flow, as highway traffic does, from one state to another. Interstate transmission connections do exist now, but are limited in capacity. They were primarily designed to meet temporary needs associated with local power emergencies, not for sustained use. If those interstate lines were upgraded to greater capacity, then we could move toward actually creating a national power grid. An effective national power grid could result in far more competition among producers of electric power across the nation, and far more options to meet demand in any local area. No state or region would need to depend simply on a small number of generating producers within its borders, and the increased number of interstate competitors would bring greater assurance of supply and lower prices. The underlying problem is basically one of incentives. With the maze of state, and federal regulations on the production, distribution and pricing of electricity, there is great risk and little incentive for private construction of costly transmission lines that cross multiple state borders. Imagine a power plant in state A, but near state B, with that plant occasionally having excess production capacity. There is no market for the power in state B, but there is demand for it in state C, which is adjacent to it. In a smoothly functioning, efficient, power transmission system, power would move from the generating plant in state A, across the border for use in state B, thereby permitting deals so that power produced in that area could be sent to state C. Through such a domino-like process, power available in one region effectively can help alleviate a shortage in another area - with only a series of relatively short-distance transmissions. Development of such an integrated electricity transmission network is what the federal government can and should foster. It would strengthen the nation; it would expand options for users; it would increase competition among suppliers, to the benefit of consumers; it would overcome the multiplicity of state regulations that have the effect of restricting incentives for profitable interstate power transmission. The Interstate Highway System did not solve all the problems of the nation's escalating population of cars, and it was not cheap. But, designed to maximize interconnections between metropolitan areas, with ample systemwide capacity to spare, it did transform the country, binding the 48 contiguous states into an integrated whole. The effect: reduced costs and increased "exports" of California fruits and vegetables to the Midwest, and reduced costs, along with increased exports of Midwest manufactured products to the West. Just as it does not make sense for every state to act like a separate country, building roads just for its own residents, or growing all of its own food supply, it is equally inefficient for each state to independently develop its own power supply. It is foolish to find electricity producers in one state claiming that they should not "help out" consumers in another state. A nationwide system would take better advantage of differential electricity demand in various parts of the country, seasonally and even in the course of a day. To consumers and industrial users in California, the effects of a national electricity transmission grid would be real and enduring, but not spectacular. It would, however, go far to achieving the quiet result that every consumer seeks - lower prices, more reliable electric power supplies. There is no single solution to California's energy crisis, but developing a national interstate electricity highway system would go far toward addressing it. Local power distribution within a state would remain a matter of state control. The federal government's role would be largely to provide financial incentives for constructing additional interstate transmission capacity, and to establish standards for its design and utilization - just as is the case with the Interstate Highway System. A survey of history and government professors conducted by the Brookings Institution last year identified the Interstate Highway System as one of the Top Seven governmental achievements of the last 50 years - along with rebuilding Europe after World War II and expanding the right to vote. An interstate electricity highway system could well be among the top achievements of government in the next half-century. MACRO POWER TRANSMISSION WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC power crisis in California. In fact, we have two problems: a short-term problem and a long-term problem. Short term, the problem, from the consumer perspective, is: -- Soaring electricity bills. -- Fear of paying the mounting debts being incurred by electricity distributors such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. either in rate increases or higher taxes. -- The threat, and to some users the reality, of no lights, no refrigeration, no heat. These concerns are real and severe. But they are merely symptoms of a serious long-term crisis: Incentives to the power industry are wrong! As Adam Smith reminded us over two centuries ago, we do not look to the good intentions of sellers to get them to serve the public interest; we look to their self interest. Then, as today, wise public policy calls for aligning the two, by providing incentives for the development of an electricity system that provides power that is dependable, is produced efficiently and is distributed competitively, so that prices are low. This long-term problem will not be solved by the series of Band-Aids that governmental officials and power producers and distributors are skirmishing over. Now is the time to develop a long-term plan. Two elements of a long-term plan for efficient and reliable electricity are clear: -- Electricity self-sufficiency for each state is bad policy. It is easy to think that dependency on power imports from other states is a root problem. It is not. Trade and competition mean access to more producers, and that can bring efficiency in electricity no less than in food, electronics or autos, as low-cost sources are utilized. (Promoting more interstate options does not preclude building more local generation, and small, "micro" electricity generating units do have a role as part of an overall electricity policy. However, the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their generally higher cost for meeting predictable long-term demand.) -- Incentives are needed to encourage investment in electricity transmission. It does no good to have low-cost power production unless the power can reach users. This is why the federal government has such an important role to play in financially encouraging and supporting a national interstate power highway system. --Burton A. Weisbrod and Glen E.

Page?WB1  Governor Calls for 10% Cut In Usage On national TV, Davis increases goal on energy Tanya Schevitz, Chronicle Staff Writer Monday,?February 26, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/26/M N44189.DTL Signaling a greater urgency in California's power crisis, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that keeping the lights and air conditioners running this summer will require every Californian to reduce electricity usage by about 10 percent. In addition, he said, the state must get more electrical power online by then. His call for a 10 percent cut is a significant jump from the 7 percent he was asking for during his State of the State speech last month, and it may be a difficult stretch for consumers. Davis made his remarks on NBC's news show "Meet the Press." State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, praised the governor's statement on national television. "The most important thing right now is that the governor said that, because there has been general skepticism statewide, reflected both in anecdotes and public opinion polls, that we are in fact facing a crisis," Perata said. "If you don't believe, you won't conform, you won't respond." But, he said, Davis will not get the conservation he wants unless consumers are given financial incentives. Perata said he will propose legislation today to give $1 billion to customers who cut down on their electricity use during the summer months. Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, said if temperatures soar this summer, it will take a "huge effort" to keep the state at safe electricity levels. NEED FOR CONSERVATION "We are in big trouble," Borenstein said. "That doesn't mean we can't avoid blackouts -- that means we will have to take serious measures." The needed steps include instituting variable prices for commercial and industrial users that reflect the supply and demand at any given hour and hooking up air conditioners to cycling systems, he said. For residential users, he said, it will mean increases for use above a certain level. Forecasters predict a shortfall of at least 5,000 megawatts this summer, but the state got some good news Thursday when the California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts for the first time in more than a month. Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California ISO, said that she does not expect any changes today but that it is too early to make any predictions about the summer power situation. "We still need to check the snowpack and the hills and the hydro situation in the state," O'Donley said. "Conservation is a big part of it, and whatever people can do to step up their conservation efforts will be a huge factor in avoiding blackouts." GOVERNOR DODGES BLAME Davis appeared on "Meet the Press" while visiting Washington, D.C., for a meeting of the National Governors Association and a concurrent meeting of the Democratic Governors Association, which he chairs. With him on the program were Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. Davis took the opportunity of the high-profile television show to tell East Coast decisionmakers and Wall Street analysts that the blame for the state's energy crisis does not lie with him and to reassure them that he is taking solid steps to resolve the problem. "Both President Bush and I inherited California, a flawed deregulation system," he said during the broadcast. "Secondly, no major plant has been built in California prior to my governorship for 12 years." He outlined some solutions, including the approval of nine new power plants, with six under construction and three expected to be online this summer, and 14 more in the pipeline. In a slip of the tongue, Davis said on yesterday morning's broadcast that consumers would need to cut electricity use to only 10 percent of last year. "It will require every Californian using about 10 percent of the electricity than they did the year before and a little luck in getting some extra megawatts on line this summer," Davis said. What he meant, a spokesman said, was they had to cut use by 10 percent. Still, that will require significant sacrifice. In addition, Davis has said that he wants to add 5,000 megawatts of power -- enough for 5 million homes -- by summer. He has promised to speed up the approval process and provide bonuses to builders who finish before July. The state also established an $800 million conservation program this year. But Borenstein said that many of the ideas floating around for spending the conservation money are for efforts that would not help for about another three years. ON NATIONAL MATTERS During yesterday's show, Davis also weighed in on President Bush's tax-cut proposal and former President Bill Clinton's controversial last-minute pardons. The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available, he said. "All of us who have been in government for a while have seen the roller- coaster ride of surpluses and then shortages and surpluses and shortages," he said. "Clearly, people need tax relief, but it should be moderated to the point where we don't kill the golden goose, which is a strong, growing economy. " Although he received a significant campaign donation from the father of Carlos Vignali, the Los Angeles drug kingpin, Davis told show host Tim Russert that he never spoke with the family about the presidential pardon Vignali received on Clinton's last day in office. Davis said he did not have enough information to know whether the pardon was a mistake, but, he said, "there's something about them in general that doesn't ring right." "However," he said, "people expect us to focus on things that matter to them, and they really want to see progress on education, the environment, tax relief, health care." Asked by Russert whether he is going to run for president in 2004, Davis did not rule it out but said that only re-election to the governorship in 2002 is on his horizon. "I'm focused on keeping the lights on and making our schools better," he said. E-mail Tanya Schevitz at tschevitz@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A1

Power-Lines Deal Davis, Edison come to terms but PG&E remains a balky holdout Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday,?February 24, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/24/M N184206.DTL Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday he had reached an agreement with Southern California Edison to put the state's financially ailing utilities back on their feet - but Pacific Gas and Electric Co., crucial to any deal, remained a holdout. The key to the deal is state purchase of utility transmission lines, which would help the companies pay off debt they piled up selling electricity for less than it cost them. Edison will part with its lines for $2.76 billion, Davis said. But PG&E is reluctant to sell, and the governor said no deal will work without PG&E. In addition to agreeing to sell its transmission lines, Edison said it would produce inexpensive power to sell to the state for the next 10 years. At a news conference in Los Angeles, Davis said the agreement in principle with Edison "provides value to both sides. The utility gets the financial wherewithal to go back into business and keep our lights on. We get commensurate value in specific benefits, which provide us long-term power at very cheap rates." Davis' framework for righting California's wobbly energy market, however, hinges on a similar agreement with PG&E. Those familiar with the talks involving the utility, based in San Francisco, said discussions are moving "very, very slowly." "They are adamantly resistant to selling their transmission facilities," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. Ron Low, a spokesman for PG&E, did not comment on Keeley's statement, but after talks concluded Thursday, Low said the two sides were "very far apart" on some issues. In a statement yesterday, PG&E Corporate Chairman Robert Glynn said the "discussions were an important milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis." "Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests," Glynn said. "We are confident that continued discussions can achieve a resolution for our company." Davis said he made "good" progress with Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, but only "some" progress with PG&E. Davis ruled out a deal that does not include PG&E. "I don't believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without acquiring 60 percent of the transmission lines. That, in turn, requires us to have an arrangement with PG&E," he said. The other 40 percent of the grid is owned by municipal utilities. Keeley said Davis is right to insist that PG&E be part of any deal. "I think the deal announced is a good first step, and will hopefully put pressure on the other companies," Keeley said. CRITICS CALL DEAL BAILOUT The purchase price set for Edison's transmission lines is 2.3 times the system's book value. Although critics argue that represents a bailout, supporters of the plan say the lines are worth far more than book value. For example, the cost to replace all the utilities' transmission lines -- a figure that probably would come into play during a possible bankruptcy -- is estimated at $20 billion. If the state pays 2.3 times the book value for all three utilities' systems, it will pay $7.2 billion total. The agreement with Edison follows a framework Davis announced last week. In exchange for the purchase of the lines, Edison also agreed to return $420 million that the utility had sent to its parent company, establish conservation easements on 20,000 acres of watershed for 99 years and drop all litigation against the state demanding the ability to immediately raise rates. Edison also agreed to continue to sell the power it produces to the state at cost for another 10 years. Edison said it still believed that it would have won its lawsuit to recover costs through a rate increase. But Edison International Chairman John Bryson said, "This agreement is far preferable to perhaps years of protracted litigation." NO RATE INCREASE Davis continued to insist that the deal would not require a rate increase, although he has indicated that the rate increase adopted by the state Public Utilities Commission last month -- which was supposed to last 90 days -- would stay in place. Davis has been under pressure to meet deadlines he has imposed himself for making progress in the energy crisis, which he said were designed to reassure Wall Street. However, he also had a personal stake in making yesterday's announcement, as he left immediately for a five-day trip to the East Coast. Davis will spend four days at the National Governors Association in Washington, D.C., and a concurrent meeting of the Democratic Governors Association, which he chairs. Much of his time will be spent reassuring his fellow governors that the crisis is under control, as well as meeting with President Bush and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. DAVIS ON 'MEET THE PRESS' Davis also will use the time to make national media appearances, including one on "Meet the Press" tomorrow. Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said the appearances will allow Davis to address some East Coast media accounts of the energy crisis. "A lot of misconceptions and myths have crept in," South said. "It's not helpful to California; it's not accurate on how the crisis came about and how we're trying to solve it." After he leaves Washington, Davis will spend a day in New York to meet with Wall Street analysts. Yesterday, he suggested that he would be asking for their support in California's quest for revenue bonds to help pay for power purchases. California will have spent $2.8 billion on power by next month, and its credit ratings have been downgraded by some analysts. Consumer advocates reacted with skepticism to Davis' tentative deal with Edison. Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, The Utility Reform Network, said she was displeased with the governor's plan because it commits ratepayers to paying off an unidentified portion of utility debt. "Nothing says what the final price tag is," she said. Dealing for Power -- Power lines: The state would buy Southern California Edison's transmission lines for about $2.7 billion, 2.3 times their estimated book value, to help bail out the financially strapped utility. -- Helping out: Edison parent Edison International would pay the utility about $420 million. -- Payback: Edison would drop its lawsuit seeking higher electricity rates and would to continue to sell the state cheap power for another 10 years. -- The other shoe: ''Some progress'' reported in talks over a similar deal with PG&E, which is reluctant to sell its lines. Source: Associated Press Other Developments ENERGY FORECAST California enjoyed its second straight day without a power alert. Lori O'Donley, spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator said continued warm weather around the West and completion of maintenance on some power plants that had been out of operation kept the state above the percent reserve mark. O'Donley said the state should remain out of the danger zone during the weekend. MORE MEGAWATTS COMING Mirant Corp., announced that it signed a contract to provide 750 megawatts of power to the state during the month of March. "We became more confident in our ability to enter such a contract after we received full payment from the Department of Water Resources for a bill due Feb. 20," said Randy Harrison, executive director of the company's western operations. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR SETTLEMENT Three generators reached a settlement with the California Independent System Operator to continue to supply emergency power to California until March 18 even though it is unclear who will pay for much of that power. Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc. signed an agreement that effectively extended a U.S. District Court judge's temporary restraining order that had required the generators to supply power to the power grid operators. In the meantime, the three generators, along with Duke Energy Corp. and Mirant Corp., have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for an emergency order forcing the Independent System Operator to provide a creditworthy buyer for their power. The federal commission on Feb. 14 told the system operator that it could not force generators to take on "unacceptable financial risks" by selling without a reasonable expectation of being paid. CONSERVATION REWARD State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, said he will propose legislation to give $1 billion to customers who conserve on their electricity bills during the summer months. Perata claims that his bill, which would pay consumers a $10 refund for every megawatt hour saved, would reduce the amount of money that the state would have to spend buying power on the expensive spot market.

 Hey, how's things? Long time not chat.  What's up?  Anywho, you seem like the right person to respond to this email.  (And I have no idea.)  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Glad to hear it went well.  Debra never called. 
 Hi Dana:  Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner.  Things, as you know, are, well, a little nuts.  It was great to meet you and I would be happy to discuss opportunities.  I need to be in S.D. in the next few weeks. Perhaps we could have lunch, or something, and you could fill me in on what you folks do.  Best, Jeff    Dana Perino <dana@gablegroup.com> 09/14/2000 06:40 PM 
 FYI.  Chris:  Any progress with Freeman on creditworthiness issues?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Sally: My name is Jeff Dasovich.  The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I contact you.  The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues, and I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.  I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Jeanne:  Couple of thoughts.  1) If California wants to get out of this crisis, it's critical that DWR be creditworthy.  Bilas' proposal helps in that regard.  We've been thinking pretty hard about the issue and working with DWR to try to fix creditworthiness concerns.  Christian, it might make sense to put together some comments supporting Bilas' approach and perhaps give him some additional recommendations about what the PUC needs to do to get DWR creditworthy? If so, (see note below), we have an opportunity to provide those comments to the PUC by this Friday.  2) Scott Govenar--on the direct access piece.  Seems like it would be very useful to get the DA coalition we're working with in Sacramento to jointly file some comments on Friday in response to the Bilas proposal supporting a ban on any PUC action on the DA prohibition since the Legislature is still working on it.  What are your thoughts?  And if you and the rest of the Sacramento team agree, can we work with Jeanne to get some (brief) language put together and work to get the rest of the coalition to sign on. Alternatively, we could work to get the other folks file individually.  Your thoughts on both approaches is appreciated.  Best, Jeff    JMB <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 02/27/2001 10:04 AM

 Have these letters been sent?  If so, Linda, would it be possible to have overnighted to me "official versions" of the letters?  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks a million, buddy.  Very useful. 
 Thanks.  What's your fax number?  I'll get a copy of the Bilas alternate decision to you as soon as I can.  Best, Jeff    Christian Yoder@ECT 02/27/2001 01:17 PM 
 Well, looks like it's that time again.  There only 2 questions.  Howzabout if the S.F. contingent takes #1 and the East Bay Gang takes #2 and we distribute around over the weekend?  Thoughts?

 Pact With PG&E Eluding Governor Power: Davis says obstacles include a debt that is double Edison's. Others cite an aggressive corporate culture as an impediment to state purchase of grid. By DAN MORAIN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers   ?????WASHINGTON--As he attempts to finalize a settlement with Southern California Edison, Gov. Gray Davis said Monday that his effort to rescue a more recalcitrant Pacific Gas & Electric has been short-circuited by issues far more difficult than those raised by the state's other two ailing utilities. ?????PG&E's debt could be as much as $8 billion, Davis indicated--twice the red ink of Edison, which Friday reached a preliminary agreement to sell its transmission lines to the state for $2.76 billion to pay off some of its staggering debt. Davis acknowledged that the Edison deal would mean nothing unless he was able to reach a twin pact with PG&E. ?????Seasoned utility watchers see PG&E's stubborn negotiating posture as partly a bargaining ploy and partly the result of underlying business issues at the San Francisco company. ?????Some cite a more aggressive corporate culture at PG&E than at Edison that has left PG&E alone on a precarious pinnacle, with bankruptcy on one side and partial dismembering by the state on the other. ?????Brian Youngberg, senior utility analyst with the Edward Jones investment firm in St. Louis, said PG&E "has historically pushed the envelope more in certain situations and that probably reflects their corporate culture. They're just sticking to their guns." ?????While Edison appears to have rejected bankruptcy law protection as an option, PG&E has not. ?????Although Davis did not specify the size of PG&E's debt, he said it is "more than twice the size of Southern California Edison's." As part of the deal between Davis and Edison, both sides agreed that the utility's debt is about $4 billion, sources close to the talks have said. ?????"We are making progress" with PG&E, said Davis, attending the annual National Governors Assn. conference in Washington, D.C. "I want people to understand it is a far more complicated transaction. . . . It is just going to take a little longer." ?????Officials at PG&E and its parent, PG&E Corp., declined to publicly discuss the company's stance, citing the sensitivity of the negotiations. Company spokesman Ron Low said only that "we expect to meet again this week. There was no time or date set yet." ?????San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn, one of Davis' energy advisors, said the parties "had contact over the weekend" but he declined to elaborate. ?????"We in the governor's office would very much like to reach arrangements with them and don't want to say anything in public that spoils the negotiations," he said. ?????PG&E's hard-nosed bargaining stance is no surprise to Wall Street analysts and consumer advocates who have watched the utility's aggressive moves to shed its hydroelectric system, now blocked by state law, and to recoup past electricity and other costs. ?????"It could be a negotiating tactic," said Lori Woodland, an analyst with Fitch Inc., the credit-rating firm that was the first to drop PG&E and Edison's debt to junk bond status. ?????"PG&E has the largest piece of the pie" in terms of uncollected electricity costs, Woodland said. "It could also be just the thought of having to sacrifice their assets to pay for what ended up being flawed public policy." ?????Consumer advocate Michael Shames contends that PG&E might believe that a bankruptcy judge would allow the utility to sell some assets and restructure its debt in ways that would be preferable to anything the state is offering. ?????"On the other hand, if Edison and [San Diego Gas & Electric] do sign on, then PG&E almost has to or risk the wrath of the governor and the Public Utilities Commission for the next seven years," said Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ?????Edison is more comfortable in the role of regulated utility than is PG&E, said Mike Florio, a lawyer with the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ?????"PG&E really seems to hate PUC regulation and wants to get as far away from it as it can, even if it means taking the company into the tank," said Florio, who is on the governing board of the California Independent System Operator, which runs the transmission grid owned by the three utilities. ?????The utilities have amassed more than $12 billion in debt as they paid record sums for wholesale power last year, but were barred by state regulators from passing those costs on to California consumers of electricity. ?????The level of debt is a fundamental part of the negotiations between the Davis administration and the three private utilities. At least part of that debt ultimately will be passed on to consumers. While Davis says he opposes rate hikes, his plan would restructure the rate system by propping up rates in the coming years, even as electricity costs may fall. ?????Davis on Friday announced the outlines of an accord in which the state would buy Edison's share of the transmission grid for $2.76 billion. He said he hopes to make the deal final by week's end with Edison and Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric. ?????Davis, meanwhile, is scheduled to meet today with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to outline his plan to take over the transmission grid. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must approve the state takeover of the grid, and FERC Chairman Kurt Hebert has been quoted recently as being skeptical of the plan. ?????"Some people in Washington see this as more of an ideological statement," Davis said. "As a governor, I see it as a practical solution. . . . Clearly, we have to persuade lots of people in Washington that what we're doing is the right thing." ?????Davis expressed optimism that the Bush administration would approve the transfer. Davis and other governors attending the conference met with the president for about 45 minutes at the White House on Monday. ?????In his opening remarks, Bush repeated his desire to give the states more authority, saying "real change comes from the states up." ?????Davis noted that he and other Western governors are hoping for federal aid to overhaul the transmission and distribution systems for electricity and natural gas system. ?????"If we're going to have a strong economy," Davis said, "we have to have the electricity to power it." ?????Davis, chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., was scheduled to attend a $5.5-million fund-raiser Monday night for the Democratic governors in Washington. He will then leave for New York, where he will hold personal fund-raisers and confer with Wall Street analysts Wednesday about the state's energy situation. ?????Meanwhile, Duke Energy North America on Monday suspended a lawsuit it had filed against Davis. The company said it reached an "interim settlement" to sell power to the state at the same below-market prices that it originally had agreed to supply to Edison and PG&E under long-term contracts. ?????Duke sued the governor after he used emergency authority to seize the Duke contracts and similar contracts signed by other energy companies with the two utilities. Davis' action prevented the Power Exchange, the state's now defunct electricity market, from liquidating the contracts after Edison and PG&E defaulted on multimillion-dollar payments. ?????The agreement reached Monday between Duke and the state expires April 30, a Duke spokesman said, which should give the parties enough time to reach a more formal settlement. ?????Power Exchange officials, however, are pressing ahead with their $1-billion claim against the state. Under California law, the state must pay reasonable value for private property seized under the governor's emergency authority. * * * ?????Morain reported from Washington, Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles.

 Just faxed it to you. 
 Greetings Catherine and Roger:  A PUC staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in Ontario, CA called to complain that we're turning back the school for credit issues.  The staffer says that "a hospital might also be involved."   Can you provide any more information?  The PUC staffer does not seem to have much information, but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking us to explain.  Sort of ironic:  PUC Commissioner Woods states that his goal is to drive all ESPs from the state, the Legislature passes and the Governor signs a bill prohibiting Direct Access, and now the PUC is concerned that California might actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice.  (The PUC is particularly concerned since they recently passed an order prohibiting gas customers from returning to the LDC---ironic indeed)  Any information that you folks can provide as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Mike.  Given time constraints, might be more efficient if we agree internally prior to sending out to the coalition.  Could folks please provide any comments to Mike Day pronto so that Scott Govenar can start immediately to get the DA coalition on board?  Scott, could you hold off until Mike gets and incorporates any internal comments?  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff    MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 02/27/2001 03:24 PM 
 Thanks, Catherine.  We've had a conversation with the PUC staffer and she's pretty ill-informed.  We told her that we need specific details.  I'll get back to you just as soon as (and if) I get them.  Best, Jeff    Catherine Woods@EES 02/27/2001 03:30 PM 
 Catherine/Roger:  Here are some more details forwarded by our outside counsel.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Jess: I work in Government Affairs in San Francisco.  I would like to discuss internally and think hard about this before we give any response to the staffer at the CPUC---not because we have any reason not to respond, but because this a problem created almost exclusively by the PUC, and I don't want to give the PUC the opportunity to shift bad decision making and actions onto us.  There's a very easy fix to the situation.  The Commission can reverse the bad decision it made a month or so ago, and permit customers to return to utility service.  I've forwarded all of the information to Catherine Woods and Roger Ponce. Let's discuss more internally when we've gathered up all the facts and then decide whether and how we choose to respond to the staffer at the PUC.  My number's 415.782.7822.   Feel free to give me a ring.  Thanks very much Mike for helping to track down the info.    MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 02/27/2001 06:16 PM 
 Too hot a market: How energy producers manipulate California   (Published Sept. 22, 2000) The priciest place to shop this August in California was in Pasadena. There at the California Power Exchange, where much of the state's electricity is bought and sold, prices that utilities paid for power (an average $166 per megawatt) were up fivefold from the previous August ($32). What is happening? Among other things, too much power on hot days is being purchased in the near-panic environment that develops in the hours before a possible crisis. Too little is being purchased as it should be -- days, or even months, in advance. How was this new market-based system of buying electricity supposed to work? Much of the action was supposed to take place at the Power Exchange. There vibrant trading was supposed to exist in a variety of markets. Some utilities would be busy shopping for electricity the next day. Others, depending on their needs, would be squirreling away supply a month, even a year, in advance. Selling this power are private companies that have been busy purchasing fossil-fuel burning generators from the state's investor-owned utilities. Under the state's restructuring of electricity, these utilities were obligated to sell their fossil-fuel burning plants, but not necessarily their nuclear or hydroelectric generators. On any given day, up to 95 percent of the power needed to fuel California was supposed to be already purchased. The idea was to leave just a little bit for the last minute. Headquartered in Folsom, the state's entire grid is managed by an agency known as the Independent System Operator. The ISO's job is to buy whatever extra power is necessary to keep the lights on. With literally only hours to work with, the ISO is ill-suited to drive hard bargains. The ISO pays up to $250 per megawatt. The problem is that the ISO's spot market is way too big, and too pricey. It is buying up to 30 percent of California's power on some days, particularly hot ones. This August, less power is being purchased in those struggling futures market down in Pasadena. More was being bought in Folsom. This is a telltale sign that California's electricity market is working for those who own power plants, not those who pay the bills that are poised to rise.

 You get this?  Someone that I know forwarded it along to me.  Know anything about it?  Best, Jeff   - Capacity Forum.doc 
 I'm scheduled to meet with Kari at 3:30 PST tomorrow, ostensibly to talk about demand buy-down.  Also presume to message the letter from Steve Kean to the Senators and our solution (perhaps in advance of meetings, phone calls that might take place later in the week with legislative leaders).  But would like to add to agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily call in the event folks have additional suggestions.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much, Scott.  Shouldn't be a big problem.  Our buy-down auction would require the customer to commit to a fixed reduction over an extended period (for a price), and the reduction would have to be verifiable, i.e., the customer would need to have the equipment necessary to verify (which isn't a problem for large customers).  Sounds like a misunderstanding on the part of the legislator and something that we should be able to talk through. I'll be there tomorrow.  If it makes sense for me to meet with them, just let me know.  Who's the legislator  in charge of demand buy-down?  Best, Jeff    Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 02/27/2001 07:58 PM 
 Thanks, Roger.  We'll need to determine whether we've turned the customer back.  Any help that you and Catherine can give in that regard is appreciated.  Then we can decide if, and how, we choose to respond to the PUC staffer.  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff    Roger O Ponce@EES 02/27/2001 07:27 PM 
 will call shortly. 
 It's always darkest before the light (though it may not get light in our lifetimes).  Looks great.  Couple of points:  1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton (as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else, it seems), if it has the inkling.  That's an egregious provision in ABx6.  2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, "pay them their PX credits." I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to seek and get the money owed to us.  We could seek the additional language, but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of attention, may be a preferable path.  3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms Migden (ABx8?)  that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.  Anyone know about it? We may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with Delainey.  Best, Jeff 
 To Jim's last point.  I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems to always be tied to this notion that "California is a net importer, even in the winter."  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.  Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion: If California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm struggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable to Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years.  To keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.  The basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the summer.  Let's take two scenarios:  1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its peak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so overbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.  Irrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking. The only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at a minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors.  2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking summer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking period.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California closes its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.  I realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW (e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks.  With that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW is long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of power?

 Christian:  Could you let me know as soon as possible if 1) the proposed decision that I faxed you yesterday is go to go, i.e., adequately addresses our concerns regarding creditworthiness or if 2) we want to recommend some additional provisions?  If we want to recommend additional provisions, could you let me know what those are?  I want to make a run at getting this deal done at the CPUC ASAP,and would like to push Peevey to get Davis to have the PUC pass it out at their next meeting. But need to know if it's good as is or needs some tweeking.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much for getting back to us.  So if I understand the bottom line:  1) the customer was mistakenly put back to SoCal (due to the dual service territory character of the customer's facilities), 2) the customer will be returned to our service, 3) the customer's contract with us expires on 5/31, and 4) the customer will have the option of re-signing with us, or returning to SoCalGas when the contracts ends on 5/31?  If I've confused anything, please let me know.  And thanks again for helping track down the info.  Best, Jeff    James D Foster@EES 02/28/2001 12:56 PM 
 har-dee-har-har.  I mean, will we be celebrating in some fashion.  I'm scheduled to go to Houston--I'm not kidding--but if there's something planned, which I assume there is, then I'm going to cancel my trip to Houston, like pronto.

 Eldon said that you were making dinner on Friday, the 9th, and that he was flying a plane to pick up Cameron and Rory in Carmel.  Have you guys spoken in the last few months!?!?!?  (kidding.)  And don't worry about my birthday--that's not the issue.  It's Eldon's 80th--that's huge.  Friday is the 9th.  So I'm just checking in to see what's up.  My very strong inclination--for a variety of reasons, but Eldon's b-day is the biggest one--is to cancel.  Signed, confused    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 02/28/2001 01:10 PM 
 Thanks.  It would of course be easiest to make the calls and say "pass it out now, as is,"  but if more is needed to fix the credit issue, want to be prepared to tell them how the decision needs to be modified.  If it's fine as is, all the better.  Best, Jeff    Christian Yoder@ECT 02/28/2001 12:59 PM

 Thank you.  FYI.  Seems that the problem was that the last letter in my IZIO login (that comes up automatically when pulling up the page) was being truncated (which may result from my regular work login pre-empting the IZIO login--the two are exactly the same, except that my work login truncates the last letter of my name).

 I understand that there may be a need to give no quarter on this, but given the circumstances--i.e., we talk every day and time and resources are extremely tight--is it reasonable to temporarily suspend filling this thing out for the next 60-90 days?  Lemme know.  My sister just called and said that the earthquake in Seattle was 7.0. That's big.  Best, Jeff    Lysa Akin@ECT 02/28/2001 09:57 AM 
 Sandi:  Apologies.  I meant and forgot to mention on the 11:30 call that the pipeline group is having their annual customer meeting (VPs of large energy companies throughout the West and Midwest) at the Santa Barbara Biltmore on April 12th and 13th.  They would very much like to get Bill Keese to speak (preferably on the morning of the 13th, but the morning of the 12th would work as well).  They'd like Bill to discuss the energy situation in California.  They can cover however much of Bill's costs--if any--that the State of California allows to be covered.  The folks at the pipeline group asked if we could make the contact with Bill and see if he's available and willing.  Given your relationship, thought you might be able to check.  They're anxious to get someone lined up as soon as possible.  Feel free to contact Laura Lantefield directly at 402.398.7080. Thanks very much for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  I was trying to get a fix on whether there's something going on on the Friday of your Dad's b-day to see if I need to cancel the Houston trip.  What do you think?  xoxoxxo 
 Apologies.  The first version incorrectly left in some DWR credit issues and had a couple of other goofs.  Please discard and review and comment on this one.  But if you've already reviewed the other, no worries, since the attached is extremely similar (less the couple of goofs).  Thanks. 
 Lad can play both roles pretty effectively.    Drew Fossum 02/28/2001 01:57 PM

 The author is a very well-know Republican, Dan Schnur.  Needed - Star to Guide Us As Gov. Gray Davis gets the state deeper into the energy business, PUC chair is no bright light Dan Schnur Wednesday, February 28, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/28/E D102858.DTL IN A DEAL that serves mainly to malign the good name of white elephants, Gray Davis last week proposed to solve California's energy crisis by spending several billion dollars of taxpayer money to purchase more than 30,000 miles of transmission lines from the state's utilities. In addition to offering to pay the privately owned utilities more than twice the book value, Davis will put the state on the hook for more than a billion dollars in desperately needed repairs to the transmission system. None of which will do anything to keep the lights on this summer when temperatures start to rise and the state's lack of power capacity leads to regular rolling blackouts. Davis' proposal also raises the question of which state employees will take on this highly complex and technical challenge. Since assuming control of the purchase of electricity from the utilities last month, state bureaucrats have been folded, spindled and mutilated in their efforts to negotiate prices with seasoned private sector professionals. California is currently paying more than $50 million per day for electricity, running up a bill that will exceed $2 billion by the end of February. Not reassuring is the prospect of the same negotiators being entrusted with the operation and upkeep of the power lines. Facing re-election next year, Davis knows that any rate increase would be political hemlock. So the governor's other primary objective would seem to be identifying other words to describe the rate increases Californians will soon pay. Doing great damage to Capitol thesauruses, Davis has announced something he calls a "dedicated rate component." The practical effect will be the expiration of the temporary 10 percent rate reduction and a permanent 9 percent rate increase. Translated into English from the original Davis-ese, the solution means most Californians will soon pay almost 20 percent more for their electricity. The billions of dollars in revenue bonds that Davis will issue have already been double-promised, both to pay back state coffers for the electricity currently being purchased and to subsidize the future cost of keeping the utilities solvent. It's a good bet that the 20 percent increase is just the beginning. Unfortunately, Davis' twin goals of spending billions of dollars to bail out the utilities and avoiding rate hikes are mutually and utterly contradictory. The reason that the utilities need saving in the first place is because the state has forbidden them from charging market prices for electricity. And the only way that the state can continue to offer artificially low rates is to either raise taxes, eliminate other spending programs, or pretend to subsidize the cost with the same bonds that have already been double-committed. Knowing that there's not nearly enough money available to allow Davis to keep all of his promises, the utilities themselves have done an admirable job of restraining their enthusiasm for the governor's proposal. Southern California Edison's leaders, recognizing a gun to their head when they saw it, signed onto the deal. PG&E seems ready to fight on, but they're not bargaining from a position of great strength. Public opinion is already solidly against the utilities, and it's not like they can start supplying power to Arizona if they can't come to terms with Davis. If the state is going to involve itself so deeply in the energy business, Davis needs to find some qualified assistance. Unfortunately, he has instead entrusted California's electricity future to a Democratic Party campaign worker with virtually no experience in energy or power-related issues. Just over a year ago, Davis appointed Loretta Lynch, a San Francisco trial lawyer and longtime Democratic campaign aide, to fill a vacancy on the state Public Utilities Commission. Less than 60 days after Lynch joined the commission, Davis promoted her to the chairmanship. Lynch prepared for her responsibilities through several years in state Democratic politics, including stints as assistant campaign manager for state Attorney General John Van de Kamp's unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1990, as deputy campaign manager for Dianne Feinstein's successful U.S. Senate campaign in 1992 and as campaign manager for Delaine Eastin's 1994 race for state superintendent of public instruction. For good measure, Lynch worked with aides to then-Gov. Bill Clinton in 1992 to squelch media investigations into the earliest reports of the emerging Whitewater scandal. This is the resume of someone whose only previous experience with electricity had been turning on and off the lights at state Democratic Party headquarters. Lynch's lack of experience and knowledge about energy has undoubtedly helped turn a significant problem into a full-fledged disaster. California's utilities spent months begging for permission and guidelines to sign long-term agreements with suppliers that would have greatly reduced electricity prices. Both the utilities and their suppliers say that Lynch and her fellow commissioners turned a deaf ear. As late as December, Lynch was still telling the news media that no emergency existed and that California had all the electricity it needed. All things considered, Davis might as well have named James Carville as commander of the California National Guard. More than 20 years ago, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown appointed another young campaign worker to a critically important position in his administration. Rose Bird, whose only prior legal experience was as a deputy public defender in Santa Clara County, was named as Chief Justice of the state's Supreme Court. By the time California voters made her the first Supreme Court justice in the state's history to be recalled from the bench, she had managed to overturn more than 60 death sentences. Until her death in 1999, Bird helped define an entire generation of California politics and public safety debate. Ironically, one of the keys to Davis' election as governor was his ability to distance himself from the legacy of both Brown and Bird. But Davis may have repeated his former boss's worst mistake when he named an equally inexperienced campaign staffer to lead the state agency that is tasked with the responsibility for solving California's electricity crisis. There is still time for Davis to avoid punchline status. But he must immediately replace Lynch with someone who possesses the experience and expertise to help lead California through this critical time. Davis, who is the most politically calibrated of governors, may already be heading in this direction. Polls show that Californians disapprove of the job the state PUC is doing by overwhelming margins. By the time voters learn that it's the governor's job to oversee the PUC, Davis may decide that keeping a political crony in such an important position is a luxury he can't afford. Because the last thing he wants is to head into a re-election campaign being forced to defend the Rose Bird of electricity. Dan Schnur, longtime veteran of California politics, was communications director for Republican presidential candidate John McCain and for former Gov. Pete Wilson. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A21

 Minor edit.  No big deal. Check it out. 
 Thanks so much for responding, Sally.  Very interested in exploring the possibilities with you.  Greatly appreciated.  Wow, that's the only other Jeff Dasovich I've ever heard of.  No kidding. Referred to you by Lee Green. Don't yet have soil test or temp profiles, but am in the process of figuring out how to get them done.  Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated.  I'll be around the weekend of March 10th.  If that works for you, great; otherwise, we can try another date.  Again, can't thank you enough for responding.  I don't know where it'll lead, but I've got a hunch that it just might work out.  Enjoy drinking your wine (had the syrah recently) and very much look forward to meeting you.

 Funny thing.  Right after we'd discussed my company's mark to market accounting in class on Monday, this article showed up on Wednesday.  Thought you might be interested.  TEXAS JOURNAL --- Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing ---- By Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road.  Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.  Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders.  But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.  "There could be a quality-of-earnings issue," says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. "There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in gain to not arise sometime in the future."  The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with their earnings.  But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years.  So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings.  If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e  Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models.  "Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're not telling you how they got to that answer," says Stephen Campbell, an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. "That is essentially saying `trust me.'"  Accounting-rule makers at the Financial Accounting Standards Board have debated the subject of how to value energy-related contracts extensively in recent months. "Two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy-related contracts and may arrive at widely different values," an FASB task force studying the issue wrote in a June report. "Those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value."  Despite this concern, FASB isn't inclined to offer any explicit guidance for how such contracts should be valued. "There are just too many models and too many different types of instruments for us to have a one-size-fits-all type of model," explains Timothy Lucas, FASB's director of research in Norwalk, Conn.  One way to determine the size of a company's unrealized gains is to compare the change in the values of net assets from risk-management activities from quarter to quarter. Some companies also disclose how much they're adjusting their cash-flow statements to reflect unrealized gains that have been booked as earnings. That's how one can determine the size of the unrealized gains at Dynegy and Enron, for example, the two companies confirm.  A reporter's examination of Dynegy's financial filings shows the company's earnings are highly dependent on unrealized gains from risk-management activities. For its most recent quarter, ended June 30, Dynegy reported earnings of 38 cents a diluted share -- 71% of which came from unrealized gains, the company confirms. (The company's per-share earnings would have been 20 cents higher if not for a one-time stock dividend.) For all of 1999, Dynegy recorded $115 million in unrealized gains, accounting for 51% of its earnings.  Enron confirms it booked $747 million in unrealized gains from risk-management activities during the second quarter, more than the company's total $609 million in earnings before interest and taxes. Absent unrealized gains, the company would have reported a quarterly loss. For the quarter, the company reported earnings of 34 cents a diluted share, up 26% from a year earlier.  But not all companies disclose enough information for investors to calculate how large their unrealized gains are. El Paso says that's the case with its own quarterly reports, which disclose short-term assets and liabilities from risk-management activities -- but not long-term risk-management assets and liabilities.  For the second quarter, El Paso reported that its energy marketing and trading unit earned $152 million before interest and taxes, 24 times what it earned a year earlier. In an interview, El Paso's chief financial officer, Brent Austin, says unrealized gains represented about a third of that total. He says most of the cash from those gains will materialize within a year.  In its financial reports, Dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some contract valuations. It explains that with some long-term contracts for which market-price quotes aren't available, "the lack of long-term pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments . . . [using] historical market data to forecast future elongated pricing curves." Dynegy cautions that actual cash returns may "vary, either positively or negatively, from the results estimated."  But like Enron, El Paso and others, Dynegy provides scant details about its mathematical models -- such as the assumptions they use for market volatility and long-term price forecasts for natural gas and electricity. Nor is the company required to disclose more.  "The disclosure mentions risks," says John Cassidy, an analyst who tracks Dynegy for Moody's Investors Service in New York. "But I don't know that the disclosure offers enough detail for you to be able to quantify how much risk there is."  El Paso's filings warn that "because the valuation of these financial instruments can involve estimates, changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates can occur, changing our valuation and potentially resulting in financial losses." Enron cautions that the values it assigns to various transactions are based on "management's best estimate."  The companies are required to disclose what they think their maximum potential single-day risk-management losses might be, figures that also are based on various undisclosed market assumptions. But energy traders cite competitive reasons for not disclosing more.  "You don't necessarily want to tip off everyone to what you're doing," says John Harrison, chief financial officer for El Paso's merchant-energy unit.  Echoing remarks by executives at other energy traders, Enron's executive vice president and chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, says Enron runs a relatively balanced portfolio and that the estimates factored into his company's valuations are conservative. In large part, he says, those estimates are based on quoted market prices where available. Where they're not available, Mr. Causey says Enron bases its estimates in part on long-term pricing trends, as well as the company's own trading experience, which dates to 1990.  Further, Mr. Causey says, Enron's unrealized gains don't depend heavily on gains from long-term contracts that extend beyond the periods for which market quotes are available, reducing the potential for significant earnings revisions. The average length of Enron's risk-management contracts is just two years, he says. To be sure, though, some of Enron's electricity contracts extend for 25 years.  "We're getting the cash in quicker than you might think," Mr. Causey says. "They don't stay unrealized very long."  El Paso says its contracts have an average life of six years, with some running as long as 20 years. Dynegy says the longest risk-management contracts for which it uses mark-to-market accounting are 10 years, though it doesn't disclose an average length. Dynegy's chief financial officer, Robert Doty, says 96% of the company's gas contracts close out by 2002, while 75% of its power contracts expire by 2003. "The cash will come in," he says.  As for why the company doesn't disclose the extent of any bias, bullish or bearish, it has in the market, Dynegy executives say that information, like the estimates behind its mathematical models, is proprietary. Such disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to. But "we don't see that would be in the best interests of shareholders," Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now.  Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.  But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans.  Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios.  At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. Lev, "I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings."   - - - - - - - - - - - -  Document Released on 2000-09-20 02:20:08.0 EST - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 FYI.  Well if she ain't sweet.... 
 FYI.  Looks like what we suspected is about to launch, i.e., an orchestrated effort by Davis to go after the suppliers.  Just found out the following from Sue Mara, who attended the ISO board meeting today:  The ISO is scheduled to release a "report" today claiming that suppliers are price gouging. The California AG has subpoena-ed generator-members of the WPTF---very extensive questions asking for just about everything under the sun.  Likely that we can expect a loud call for regional price caps very soon.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 02/28/2001 06:25 PM 
 What kind of contract?    William Gang@EES 02/28/2001 06:32 PM 
 Laura: Thanks so much for including me on the list.  Quick question:  Which committe is this and who's on the committe?  Is there an agenda for the meeting on the 5th?  Thanks again. Best, Jeff 
 Yes, I would like to attend if that would be possible.  Thanks very much for the info.  I assume that the folks on the committe are the energy managers of the companies (like K.C. Mares, who I met when I met with Justin a few weeks ago)?  Jeff    "Laura Goldseth" <lgoldseth@svmg.org> 02/28/2001 07:30 PM 
 Here is the final version.  I'll bring copies with me tomorrow to Sacramento and can drop them off at Hedy's office.  I meet with Kari Dohn at 10 AM and will be attending the AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting at 1:30.  I can drop off copies before I head out for the Dohn meeting.  If there's anything else, just let me know.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 In that case, definitely baloney. 
 Thanks, Steve. That helps clear things up enormously (at least in my little mind).  Best, Jeff    Steve Walton@ECT 02/28/2001 09:27 PM 
 Thanks.  Got if fixed. 
 Bill:  In order to assess, I need to understand the structure.  What's the contract structure look like now?  What are we proposed to change, including counterparties?  What part of the existing contract required any PUC approval and why?  What is Edison saying needs to happen at the PUC?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff    William Gang@EES 03/01/2001 10:48 AM 
 Greetings Justin and Laura: As we discussed there is a significant coalition of folks working at the Legislature to try to remove the prohibition on Direct Access included in Hertzberg's AB1X and recently signed by the Governor.  Simply put, it is clear that the prohibition will only be removed if the business community communicates clearly  and unequivocally and vociferously to the Legislature that Direct Access is a priority for business, and that the Legislature must amend AB1X to permit Direct Access.  I've attached the media plan developed by the PR firm that's working with ARM (Alliance for Retail Markets) to increase the focus on the need to re-instate Direct Access.  The ARM coalition of energy service providers has been the focal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed (and continues to develop) around the Direct Access issue.  In order to succeed, it is critical to get as many members of the Silicon Valley Manufactures' Group to join in the effort and participate actively, particularly in the media effort.  My colleague Sue Mara has been a key player in the ARM coalition and in the development of the medial effort.  She can provide you with any information and/or assistance that you need and can also get you in contact with Edelman, the PR firm directing the media effort.  Sue's number is 415.782.7802.  Her email is smara@enron.com.  And, as always, you can contact me at any time (415.782.7822).  Looking forward to any participation that you folks can offer.  All the best, Jeff

 Folks:  Here's a catalogue of issues that Sue, Mona and I put together using Paul's outline as a guide.  Just a start (but a pretty good one), with lots more to do, but it should provide a solid platform to get the strategy completed in short order.  Best, Jeff

 Just talked to Peevey.  He told me that he and Freeman personally worked with Bilas on Bilas' draft decision--the decision designed to make CDWR creditworthy and keep the PUC from touching Direct Access until the Legislature has a chance to fix the AB1X prohibition.  I made the pitch re: decision does what it takes to fix the creditworthy issue and the Commission needs to vote it out immediately.  He said he agreed but expressed his general frustration with the decision making process generally, and said that he is not certain right now if the decision is greased to get voted out at the next Commission meeting.  He said that he's going to be talking to the Governor this afternoon and will push the issue with him.  I asked him to keep me updated.  He said that he would.  I told him that it wasn't helpful that the Governor named names in New York regarding alleged agreements about "haircuts," particularly when folks are trying to negotiate deals with DWR. He wasn't aware of that and asked me to fax him the Merril press, which I did.  I'll also fax him our letter supporting the Bilas decision.  Best, Jeff

 Thanks very much, Laura.  If it's appropriate, I would like to attend?  Just let me know.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 i send her just about everything.  if she wasn't on distribution list, it was an oversight that i'll correct, fellow "responder" on the upcoming panel in houston.  best, jeff 
 Thank you very much for the tech data.  Margaret, is there data out there regarding the California utilities performance (i.e., how many rolling blackouts, etc. v. national average)?  Thanks again.

 Yes, I'll be in Houston this week.  We could discuss there. But might be useful to discuss tomorrow when you return.  I'm available.  Seems useful to try to get a start on it tomorrow.  You available for a quick call?  My schedule's pretty flexible.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies.  At a loss to figure out how in the heck your name disappeared from this mega-list. 
 Mike (Day): As you know from the work with the DA coalition, UC/CSU is extremely interested in ensuring that the prohibition on DA included in AB1X gets "fixed" in SB27X.  Of couse we'd ideally like to make sure that the language providing the "fix" makes it crystal clear that customers retain the right going forward.  There's some concern that the "fix" language that's been floating around thus far needs some tightening to wring out the ambiguities. In that regard, Mike Smith is going to try to craft some language and forward it to you.  We'll need to try to get Mike (Smith's) language into the draft that you're putting together based on last Friday's meeting, preferably before  you circulate the next draft to the DA coalition.  Mike Smith, I'll assume that you'll contact Mike Day directly, but Mike (Day), if there's any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff

 FYI. *********************************************************************** UC Pioneers Conservation Two decades of innovations prepared campuses for energy price crunch When the state's energy crisis hit, the University of California was not caught with its fans running full blast. Across the nine-campus UC system, $65 million has been spent over two decades on energy-saving devices, including new lighting, variable speed fans, even a system to harness waste gas from landfills to run boilers. So, with Gov. Gray Davis calling for every California household and business to cut electricity use by 10 percent, UC offers a good model of conservation. Despite rapid growth in the 178,000-student system in recent years, most campuses have held electricity consumption steady, and the university will net about $75 million in savings from the projects. "We are fortunate to have on the campuses people with the religion. They have been working on this agenda since the oil embargo," said Gary Matteson, UC director of energy and utilities planning. But UC will need to do more. Facing a 146 percent increase in the cost of natural gas -- which powers the co-generators that produce electricity -- the university is now asking the state for $217 million to fund additional conservation efforts. That way, UC could offset the increase in natural gas prices. As a state institution, UC has to reduce its electricity consumption by 8 percent of its base load -- which is 334 megawatts at peak -- and by 20 percent during Stage 2 alerts, when state electricity reserves fall below 5 percent. UC has already exceeded the 8 percent reduction and Matteson said he expects the system to be ready to meet the 20 percent goal by June 1, before the summer peak hits. Like little cities, the campuses run around the clock, but laboratory lights that used to blaze continuously are now going dark when not needed, those in hallways have been dimmed or shut off when possible and the thermostats have been lowered. "I almost stumble through some of the hallways, it is so dark," said Keith Roberts, energy engineer at UC Davis. "There are a lot of people who really want to help out. We are trying to do what we can without impacting the mission of the campus." At many campuses, daily e-mail alerts remind students, as well as employees, to open their window shades to light and warm their rooms and offices during the day, and to shut off computers and lights when they are not in use. At UC Berkeley, freshman Jon Clingan, 18, said signs have been posted in the hallways and bathrooms of the residence halls, imploring students to save electricity in their rooms and even to cut short their showers. "I try to keep my light off as long as possible until it is just not possible to do work," Clingan said. In addition to conserving energy, UC protected itself against skyrocketing electricity prices by signing a four-year contract in 1998 -- along with the California State University system -- with Enron Corp to buy electricity at the 1996 rate minus 5 percent. In 1986, systemwide co-generation plants were installed to produce sufficient energy for most university buildings and to pump an additional 20 megawatts into the state's electricity grid. That approach saved most of the UC campuses from falling victim during the state's rolling blackouts -- although UC Santa Cruz went dark one day in January because its co-generation plant was out. MARKET PRICES AHEAD Still, UC officials are asking the Legislature for extra money, warning that a systemwide natural gas bill is expected to rocket from $26 million last year to a projected $64 million this year. A contract for low-priced gas is expiring and UC will soon find itself paying market prices. That means UC will face having to raise dormitory fees, cut back on night and weekend classes and turn down the air conditioners in the summer, leaving classrooms sweltering. Saying that that would be unacceptable, Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D- Santa Clara, chair of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, called a hearing on the issue last month. "I really wanted to hear how they were going to cope with the crisis," she said. UC is already negotiating with the State Department of Finance to get about $217 million for an additional list of energy efficiency and conservation projects that could save 149 megawatts within three years. Reducing electricity means reducing reliance on natural gas. John Baca, manager of the policy and strategic planning program for the Office of Energy Assessments at the state Department of General Services, said higher education facilities tend to consume a lot of energy. "They have experiments that just can't go off and they have a lot of flue hoods, and things like that," Baca said. "They have to have power for a lot of different things all the time, so there is still a lot of potential at the higher education level. But I think UC has done a really fantastic job." SYSTEMWIDE CHANGES The efforts have been made across the system. UC Santa Cruz undertook an extensive conservation project that reduced electricity consumption in academic and administrative buildings by 6 percent. UC Davis has spent about $15 million on conservation renovations during the past 10 years, saving at least $3 million a year. At UC Berkeley, more than $6 million has been spent since 1986 to improve energy efficiency on the campus by modifying and reducing light fixtures in older buildings, installing centrally located automated controls that can run heating and cooling equipment on a flexible schedule, and improving efficiency around heating pipes. "Our usage is only 3 percent above what it was in 1972-73," said Paul Black, a senior engineer in the UC Berkeley physical plant department. "And if you think of all the computers added and also the air conditioners we have added to cool computer rooms and labs, that is good."

 FYI--Davis includes us as one of the companies he signed up. I'm only aware of a 30-day deal with an option to extend for 5 years (option ends toward the end of the month, as I understand it). Not aware of any other deals we've done with DWR at this time, though others are on the table----DWR's creditworthiness remains an issue. Best, Jeff  Davis announces first round of long-term power contracts DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer Monday, March 5, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press (03-05) 12:31 PST SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state has reached 40 long-sought long-term contracts and other agreements to keep power flowing to customers of two financially ailing utilities, Gov. Gray Davis announced Monday. The deals will supply an average of nearly 8,900 megawatts per year for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers over the next 10 years and let the state buy power for far less than it has been paying on the costly spot market, Davis said in a written statement. One megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 households. For the first five years, the contracts provide power at an average price of $79 per megawatt hour, about 75 percent below recent costs on the spot electricity market, Davis said. The price drops to an average of $61 per megawatt hour, about 80 percent below spot prices, he said. ``These agreements are the bedrock of a long-term energy solution,'' Davis said in remarks prepared for delivery Monday afternoon in Los Angeles. ``The provide reliability at a reasonable price.'' Some of the contract negotiations will result in accelerated power plant construction, adding an estimated 5,000 megawatts to the state grid within the next two years, some by this summer, Davis said. The contracts amount to 75 percent of the long-term deals the Davis administration has sought under a new law that lets the state spend an estimated $10 billion over a decade to buy power for Edison and PG&E customers. Davis has pitched such contracts as one way to lift California out of its energy crisis. Negotiations have taken longer than expected, however, as his administration and power providers haggled over how much the state should pay. The Davis administration wants to stop paying for power on the expensive spot market, where desperation to keep the lights on leads to inflated prices. On Friday, the state released another $500 million to continue making such purchases on behalf of the state's two big cash-strapped utilities, bringing its spending so far to some $3.2 billion since early January. The agreements announced Monday include more than 20 power suppliers, including electricity giants Duke Energy, Calpine, Dynegy, Enron and Reliant. Davis declined to release details on individual contracts. Duke Energy said it has reached a $4 billion, nine-year agreement to sell electricity to the state. The memorandum of understanding calls for Duke to provide 550 megawatts starting next Jan. 1. That's enough power for roughly 550,000 households. That amount would rise to 800 megawatts Jan. 1, 2003, enough electricity for the equivalent of 800,000 households. The contract would continue through 2010. ``We believe long-term contracts provide the critical underpinning for a stable electricity market and are happy the state is moving in that direction,'' Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said in a written statement. The state is buying about one-third of the power used by the customers of Edison and PG&E. Both have been denied credit by suppliers who fear the financially troubled utilities won't pay for the power. California plans to recover those costs by issuing $10 billion in revenue bonds in May, with the rest of that money going to finance the cheaper, long-term power contracts. In addition to the long-term contracts, the Department of Water Resources has reached 11 agreements letting it buy a substantial amount of power on the day-ahead market, cutting the state's payment of premium prices on the real-time market, Davis said. A Stage 1 power alert was called Monday morning with reserves threatening to drop to 7 percent due to power plant maintenance and low electricity imports, said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the Independent System Operator. The ISO manages the state's power grid. 
 I'm worried about the commercial guys---they're in a "rock no boats" mode in anticipation of perhaps signing the 5-year deal.  I'll let you know what Calger sez soon as he gets back to me.  He's in a meeting.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 03/05/2001 04:34 PM

 Concur with Harry, i.e., continue to take the position that the program should be available to all.  When I was in Sacramento last week at a meeting of all the players, the utilities argument against including DA customers was based on "double dipping," i.e., payments to customers/ESPs for curtailment, plus payments to customers/ESPs for the re-sale of power to the ISO resulting from the curtailment.  The utilities "double dipping" argument is off base.  As important, the state is facing the threat of frequent and severe supply disruptions this summer and it needs to take each and every step necessary to try to avoid them.  The utility position (apart from being incorrect) seems pretty short-sighted given the dire circumstances.  So seems clear that California should include both DA and bundled customers in the program.  Best, Jeff       Harry Kingerski 03/06/2001 09:02 AM 
 No rush, but thought I'd throw this out there just ot get the ball rolling:  Looks at this point like any of the presentation dates work for me, so I don't necessarily have a preference. Options for project (and I'm really just throwing stuff out there to stimulate thought): Analyze AOL/Time Warner merger My company, Enron, is accused by some analysts of being nothing more than a Merrill-Lynch, or a Morgan-Stanley, or a Goldman-Sachs, etc.  These analysts claim that we should therefore trade at multiples that are in line with the investment houses.  We differ in that view (for a lot of reasons that I won't go into here).  Might be interesting to analyze strategies, differences, etc.  Anyway, just some thoughts to get the ball rolling.  I'm open to just about anything.  Best, Jeff

 Let's try this.  Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.  I won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.  And if someone does, the other needs to bring it up. But Prentice, if I say, "that's critical" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.  So I'm willing to have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, too.  I hope you'll going sailing today.  Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?

 Also might add that it conflicts directly with and is likely to thwart Gov's efforts to dramatically reduce demand this summer and avoid rolling black outs.

 Sue Mara was correct on the call yesterday.  While the PUC meets regularly on Thursdays, it appears they are having a meeting today at which the "Bilas Alternative" is up for a vote.  Our information is that there is some likelihood that the decision will be approved----but please don't hold your breath.  We'll disseminate information just as soon as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 The notion that it would have to be a monthly analysis sounds like pure Roger, and could likely be correct.  But we need to determine whether we can get what we need by doing a "less precise" annual versus a "monthly."  Seems that once we've made that call, we direct the scenario and they do it. Thoughts?  Best, Jeff    Robert Neustaedter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/07/2001 09:36 AM 
 Attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the PX credit and rate issues.  Few points:  Apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies. Given time crunch, the model developed is quite crude and will need refinement (to be sure). The bankruptcy scenario is included (scenario 4), but (again, given the time crunch) has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios. Tribolet should be able to provide good insights there, however. The exposure has not been calculated since GA does not have the numbers, but EES should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly. I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are.  These are key inputs and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly. For ease of use by all, and given time considerations, I've done the conceptual model in word format, rather than excel.  It will be simple to translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model (in excel).  Best, Jeff     Marcia A Linton 03/07/2001 08:22 AM

 The Commission just voted out one half of the "Bilas Alternate."  The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass through DWR costs to customers. However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access "the height of arrogance." The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting. That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the prohibition any time soon.  Best, Jeff

 If there is any possibility of doing it on Wednesday and Thursday, that would work much better with my schedule, but I can be flexible if necessary. Thanks very much for coordinating.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Steve.  Alan, any word from Tim re: resource availability?  See you all in Houston. Best, Jeff 
 No.  The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.  So all this means is that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is nothing before the commission to implement.  Sure would have been nice if the commission had passed it, though.  Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and therefore can't do an update call with edward's?  i can, however, do it on monday.  best, jeff    William Gang@EES 03/07/2001 08:28 PM 
 i won't be in class tonite.  i'm open, too, but to tell you the truth, mark, the thought of comparing us and european accounting standards/practices makes me break out in a rash.  if there's any way that we can focus on strategy, valuation, or other sorts of financial analyses that we've focused on in the course, that would be preferable from my perspective.  best, Jeff    "Vavrek, Carolyn (US - San Francisco)" <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 03/07/2001 08:13 PM

 State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without a Rate Hike By REBECCA SMITH, MITCHEL BENSON and JOHN R. EMSHWILLER Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career.  His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula.  That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. "If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes," Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. Davis and his aides don't "have a lot of time" to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon "seriously threaten the health" of the state's economy. Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Squeaky Summer Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Learning by Doing Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. "They agree to prices that make you wonder," says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. "You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer." Mr. Mills says that "to cut California some slack," he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been "extremely successful by all measures." Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. "We didn't want to just open our wallets," he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. Changing the Formula State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department of Finance, says the emergency law was "drafted poorly" and has led people to believe the DWR "only gets the leftover money." He predicts there will be "cleanup legislation." At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written "in close consultation" with Mr. Davis's Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula "threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide," the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. Balking at Buying As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. "I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released," says Ms. Connell. "I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating." In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. "I was offended" at the "heavy-handed" treatment, says Karen Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court.

 Soaring Electric Use More Fiction Than Fact Chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their towering rates Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday, March 11, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/11/M N213155.DTL  Power companies say it so often, and with such certainty, that it has become a virtual mantra: "Skyrocketing" energy use by Californians is a root cause of the state's power crisis, and justification for surging electricity prices. But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals that the mantra is a myth -- that overall growth in electricity demand hasn't been nearly as great as the industry portrays it. The industry has painted the summer of 2000 as the equivalent of a 100-year storm in meteorology -- an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing infrastructure was devastated by its force. The statistics show that 2000, taken in total, was nothing of the sort. Moreover, two independent state agencies' assessments of California's power plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily accommodated. The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power- generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent plant usage necessitated major, time-consuming repairs. "The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected and due to the Internet economy, to Silicon Valley, or server farms, or people recharging cell phones -- that's bogus," said Tom Kelly, assistant executive director of the California Energy Commission. "About as bogus as you can get." The Chronicle's findings are based on data collected by the California Independent System Operator, a manager of the state's electricity grid. They show: -- Total electricity consumption in California increased only 4.75 percent in 2000 from 1999, a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives, who have repeatedly relied on isolated, loose or selective comparisons that make growth appear as high as 20 percent. In fact, the single greatest hour of electricity usage in 2000 was actually lower than any peak demand period in 1999 or 1998. -- Average peak demand -- the average of the highest hour of electricity usage for each day -- increased only 4.79 percent from 1999 to 2000. Even during the months of May to September in 2000, when the greatest spikes in electricity usage occur, demand growth was only 8.31 percent higher than the same period the year before. -- More than 30 days of critical power shortage warnings, so-called Stage 3 emergencies, and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of moderate energy use -- levels often below those at which neither warnings nor blackouts have occurred in the past. The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the "skyrocketing demand" explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening -- that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential commodity, regardless of whether it is in short supply. Presented with The Chronicle's findings, Gary Ackerman, a representative for the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing power companies, said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand is growing strong. "That's pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the long-term historical average, which is close to 2 percent," he said. "To me, that's really strong growth." Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California -- growth of more than 4 percent is still double what was projected -- and the state has obviously fallen behind in building power plants. Even though a recent study found California ranked 47th out of the 50 states in per-capita energy consumption, the surging demand explanation has become so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel. Gov. Gray Davis has made energy conservation -- 10 percent, at that -- a centerpiece of his efforts to solve the crisis. "Energy use is growing," said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, citing the growth of Silicon Valley and high-tech operations statewide. "There's been tremendous growth, whether manufacturing or high tech -- cell phones, faxes, whatever. The stuff is growing." Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the consumer is largely to blame. In testimony and submissions to government bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis, energy demand growth has consistently been overstated. Joe Bob Perkins, the chief operating officer of Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., told the U.S. Senate in January that California's growing economy and high summer temperatures caused electricity use to "surge dramatically" -- a demand growth of 13 percent. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said Perkins' testimony was based on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of monthly retail electricity sales. "We do stand by that," Wheatley said. "Unfortunately, it does not track with ISO data." The industry-backed Edison Electric Institute said in a report that electricity demand grew by anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent during the spring of 2000, compared with the same period a year earlier. Russell Tucker, an economist for the institute, said the group's figures were derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each spring month of 1999 and 2000 and comparing them, finding the May peak rose 21 percent. Granted, the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine whether California has enough plant capacity to meet demand. But the presentation makes it appear that overall demand, not just the absolute peak, is growing by 21 percent. When the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year to year, May's figure was much lower: 12.79 percent. Also, nowhere did Edison's report note that the peak hour of 2000, a load of 43,784 megawatts on Aug. 16, was actually lower than the peak hours of either of the previous two years -- 45,884 on July 12, 1999, or 44,406 on Sept. 1, 1998. The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year grew more than June's 15.34 percent, though no blackouts occurred in that month. May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded 10 percent, the analysis showed. Most months recorded 4 percent or 5 percent, and some -- such as September -- were less than 3 percent. Two months, October and December, had demand levels lower than the year before -- 4.22 percent less for October, 1.46 percent lower for December. Mike Florio, a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO, said that even growth of less than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000 would seem overstated, since 1999 was a relatively mild weather year and 2000 was a much hotter one. "You are quite right," Florio said. " 'Skyrocketing' demand is a myth." MARKET MANIPULATION? Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that, rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand, market manipulation is behind the crisis. Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this, saying they have done everything they could to keep the lights on. They say they ran aging, decrepit plants at higher-than-normal levels last summer to accommodate what they described as unprecedented demand. They also say that, at great expense, they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing. Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply. The report, however, was heavily qualified by the FERC, which said it did not investigate other forms of manipulation. Moreover, the agency acknowledged that the bulk of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and questioning them over the telephone. The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate, in part because supply data are confidential. Thus, the question of how blackouts could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to answer. What is clear is that, at times, during the crisis this year, as much as 12, 000 megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use, mostly because of unplanned plant outages -- about four times the level anticipated by the ISO. Power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing to the levels sketched out by the ISO and the Energy Commission, and that everything from low water conditions, emissions limitations and high temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was anticipated. But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of fear of not being paid. What did go up, unquestionably, were wholesale electricity prices. While average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased by less than 5 percent, prices charged by power companies to the utilities that deliver juice to consumers increased more than 289 percent. In June, the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold, going from the 1999 level of $30.53 to $170.60. In October, prices doubled over the same period a year earlier, going from $53.47 to $111.04. And in December -- despite a 1.46 percent decline in electricity usage from the previous December -- peak wholesale electricity prices hit $425.59. They'd been $31.88 one year before. Then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six months of 2000. Overall, average peak usage during December was about 31,200 megawatts, about a fifth lower than it was in August. Average prices in December? They just about doubled, to $425 a megawatt hour. The companies' explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs, decreasing supply. Even given the high number of inoperable plants, questions remain about why the existing supply could not cover demand. On the blackout days of Jan. 17 and 18 fewer plants were offline -- and more electricity was available -- than on days when the state managed to squeeze by without turning out the lights. Even today, with Stage 3 alerts having faded away, at least temporarily, demand levels remain more or less the same as when California was in a constant state of emergency. Moreover, the lists of offline plants are as long as ever. AMPLE POWER SHOULD EXIST The Energy Commission and the ISO have concluded that California's power plants are capable of generating more than 45,000 megawatts of electricity. That means that even with plant repair outages, low water levels decreasing hydraulic generation, air-pollution rules and other environmental constraints, the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the most extreme spikes in demand. According to industry data obtained by The Chronicle, the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a government-backed trade group in Salt Lake City, concluded California would have considerable surpluses throughout 2000, including margins as high as 39 percent in December, based on data provided to it by the ISO. Even under low water conditions, the ISO reported, the state would have total power resources of 47,532 megawatts in that month. Yet unplanned outages were far higher, and the system began to crash that month and into this year, at far lower levels of demand. "Clearly," Florio said, "we should not be having a shortage at 2 a.m. on Christmas Eve, when the only person awake is Santa Claus."

 State PUC Takes On High Cost Of Energy Regulators foresee more rate increases Robert Salladay, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Monday, March 12, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/12/M N227831.DTL Sacramento -- Starting this week, state regulators will begin debating how much is enough when it comes to asking Californians to shoulder the electricity crisis by paying higher utility rates. Right now, there doesn't appear to be enough money to go around. The state government and the utilities have racked up monumental bills because of California's flawed deregulation system. And even with recent rate increases, not enough cash is coming in to pay off the debts and buy power. Over the next three weeks, deciding how that money gets divvied up to pay the state's debt will be one of the toughest jobs of the year. State Treasurer Philip Angelides said the state Public Utilities Commission would be essentially filling a shoe box with debts and commitments during a series of meetings and workshops this month, and it's going to be a tight fit without raising power bills even more. "The rubber hits the road in the next few weeks at the PUC," Angelides said. "There is a box that has to be filled up, and a no-rate-increase scenario is putting all of these things into this box. It'll be tough work." Under the law, the PUC has the power to essentially determine how much profit the utilities can make. It's a set formula, designed to give the power companies a comfortable margin and to keep power bills reasonable for consumers. But with the 1996 deregulation an utter failure in California, there are many more demands on that money. The utilities claim to be $14 billion in debt. The state of California is spending $45 million a day to buy power. Taxpayers have spent $3.2 billion so far, and the PUC recently said utility customers would be required to pay that money back. Then there is the $10 billion in bonds the state is selling to buy long- term contracts for power. Angelides said the PUC also must guarantee him an estimated $1.3 billion a year from consumers to pay off the bonds, which his office expects to begin selling by the end of May. That money could end up running out by September, or June 2002 under the most optimistic prediction, Angelides said. That could mean California would have to borrow even more money beyond the $10 billion -- money that consumers will most likely have to pay back through their bills. Gov. Gray Davis has said repeatedly that it is his "hope and expectation" that rates will not increase. But he has been criticized for seeming to say that a temporary rate increase approved in January will be made permanent and that a 10 percent rate decrease imposed when deregulation was implemented will be lifted next year. "If I wanted to raise rates, I could have solved this in 20 minutes," Davis said last month. But others are convinced now that rates will go up even more than the 19 percent. And PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he thinks the rates should go up before the summer to encourage conservation. 'FUNDAMENTALS DON'T CHANGE' "It doesn't matter what is done in terms of rhetoric, legislation, ideas or proposals at the commission -- the fundamentals don't change," said Bilas, a Republican. "There is not enough supply and too much demand. The only function on the demand side is a rate increase. Otherwise, people won't stop using electricity." Since the state is buying roughly 30 percent of the power used by the utilities -- and at the highest prices so far -- the state should be entitled to an equivalent share of the money coming in from consumers. "If we're going to issue bonds, we must have first (crack at) that money," Angelides said. His office believes that "a failure to (issue bonds) in the appropriate manner will directly and negatively impact consumer rates." Angelides also needs a commitment from the PUC over how the state will get repaid for the money it's spending to buy emergency power the utilities cannot afford to purchase. Bilas said the PUC, which will take up some of these issues at their meeting on Thursday, would have to face reality soon. 'IT'S A BAND-AID' "It's the direction we have been moving in," he said. "We're having to face up to fact that there needs to be rate increase. What is being done isn't a solution to the problem -- it's a Band-Aid." The utilities, among others, are eyeing the money as well for their significant costs. They have accumulated massive debts that need to be repaid, and have investors to satisfy. Also looking for a slice of the pie are the alternative energy producers -- including wind and solar producers -- who depend on payments from the utilities to buy the natural gas they need to operate. These facilities account for nearly a third of the energy produced in California, and any scenario that has the state getting through the summer without significant blackouts requires full operation. "What everybody has told me is this summer is going to be murder, because we don't have enough," state Senate President pro tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said recently. Three things are occurring that are designed to make sure the money going out to pay for debts and power is slightly less than the money coming in from consumers: Small alternative energy providers are expected to start getting lower payments. Utilities, as part of a state rescue plan still being negotiated, will be required to sell the electricity they generate themselves at cost. The state is signing long-term contracts for its share of power, which reduces demands on ratepayers. The idea is to leave enough headroom that will pay back the state for what it is spending over a long period of time. Angelides said the difference -- that headroom -- should be returned to the state to pay off the debts it incurred from the long-term contracts financed with the bond money and to buy emergency power. STATE WANTS ITS SHARE "We stepped into the breach here," Angelides said. "We're entitled to a fair slice of the pie." Angelides said the new rate schedule, which the PUC is determining this month, should not be used to pay back utilities for any of their debts from before Jan. 17. That's when the state started buying power for the utilities. So far, the utilities are not asking for their past debts to be repaid. Some other financing for those must be developed, such as selling thousands of miles of electrical transmission lines to raise billions of dollars. But there may not be much headroom left to pay off all the other debts. Chris Danforth with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which is designed to make sure consumers get a good deal out of the PUC, said the future payments to the alternative facilities and contracts signed by the state were going to cost more than originally planned. That eats up some of the headroom and "is indicative of a rate increase," Danforth said. Paying the Bill Most of what PG&E customers pay for electricity is spoken for but the demands are about to get a lot bigger. . Breakdown of contributors to electricity production PG&E generated power -- What the utility produces at its own plants. Alternative energy -- Electricity generated by solar, wind and biomass companies. Independent generators -- Power produced at non-PG&E plants in California and elsewhere. . PG&E customers currently pay 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour Combined sources of electricity cost 6.134 cents per kilowatt hour This portion represents 0.366 cents of leftover money . Claims on leftover money -- Money owed to the Independent System Operator, which has been forced to buy electricity at very high prices in recent months. -- Money owed to the alternative energy providers. Many of these small units have stopped operating because they have not been paid. -- Emergency power purchases likely to be necessary this summer, since the state has not secured enough long-term contracts to provide all the power it needs. That could drain either the state's coffers, or be paid for by consumers. .

 Feds Hint at Power Bill Refunds Firms ordered to justify high rates David Lazarus and Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers Saturday, March 10, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/10/M N144141.DTL Federal regulators warned power companies yesterday that they may have to refund $69 million to California ratepayers for charging unreasonable prices during recent electricity shortages. However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission left the door wide open for the unnamed 13 generators to avoid refund payments if they could offer "further justification" for why their rates should be considered fair. Consumer activists were quick to note that the commission's order was significant. "They have acknowledged for the first time that there has been abuse of the marketplace," said Doug Heller, assistant organizing director for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "It's an acknowledgment that the power companies have been ripping us off." However, consumer groups also pointed out that the order -- issued late in the day -- was partly a political ploy intended to make the Bush administration look more sympathetic to California's plight. The proposed $69 million refund also represents only a fraction of the billions of dollars that utilities have had to pay due to rising electricity rates. The commission set narrow parameters for power charges in January that may be considered unreasonable. It is only considering charges above $273 per megawatt hour during the series of Stage 3 energy emergencies that threatened statewide blackouts. William Massey, the lone commissioner who voted against the order, noted that of 70,300 power transactions in January above $150 per megawatt hour, only about 13,000 fall within the regulatory commission's parameters for potential refunds. "This order is arbitrary, capricious and unlawful," he said. "Eighty percent of the transactions have been excluded from refunds." But commission Chairman Curt Hebert characterized the order as an aggressive effort to safeguard California consumers. "Today's refund order demonstrates the commission's commitment to ensure appropriate and reasonable prices in the wholesale electricity market given the supply and demand imbalance in California," he said in a statement. POWER COMPANIES NOT WORRIED Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, said power companies are not worried about the prospect of having to pay out millions of dollars in refunds. "The people I've talked to said they can justify the costs for a majority of hours where FERC said there may have been overcharges," he said. "We will be supplying supporting data to FERC," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston. "We commend them for doing this review. We believe this can be resolved and we can all move on." Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group representing out-of-state generators, said the commission's order shows that the system is working. "In my opinion, what has been identified is talking about potential refunds, " he said. "The generators will have a chance to justify their rates. I'm not terribly troubled by that." The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid, welcomed the order, although it said $69 million is lower than its own estimates of potential overcharges. The ISO had asked the commission earlier this month to review $350 million in January power charges that exceeded the regulatory commission's "soft cap" of $150 per megawatt hour. A soft cap means the price can exceed the prescribed amount as long as a supplier can justify the charge. REFUND ORDERS ARE RARE "The granting of refunds by FERC is not a common occurrence," said Charles Robinson, the ISO's general counsel. "We're treading new ground." Considering the potential ramifications of the order, the commission was oddly furtive in issuing its press release at the very end of the business week. The commission's press office already was closed by the time of the announcement, and the commissioners had left for the day. Reached at his home, Massey acknowledged that the commission was all but inviting power companies to bury the commission in paperwork to support their wholesale rates. "Welcome to the Hebert chairmanship," he said. Hebert was appointed head of the commission last month by President Bush. Since then, the regulatory commission and the Bush administration have maintained a largely hands-off approach to California's energy crisis. "We have said from the beginning that obviously the state of California has to address these problems and these challenges," U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said this week.

 Quick question to Joe and/or Christian, John and Mary:  I'm assuming that any deal we sign with DWR that falls below the $150/MWH soft cap is free and clear of the order FERC issued on Friday as well as any other refund risk associated with FERC's December order.  Is that correct? Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 PUC SET TO MAKE KEY RULING ON UTILITY BILLS;  ELECTRICITY: REGULATORS ARE ABOUT TO DECIDE HOW TO SPLIT PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND UTILITIES. THE FORMULA COULD AFFECT FURTHER RATE HIKES.  BYLINE: RONE TEMPEST, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF    DATELINE: SACRAMENTO  BODY:   ??How much of utility customers' monthly bills will be used to pay for California's multibillion-dollar entry into the power market?  ??That's the question as regulators set out in coming days to determine how to split ratepayers' bills between the state, which has been buying electricity at the rate of $ 45 million a day since late January, and the debt-laden utilities, which continue to deliver that power and collect customers' payments.  ??The issue has moved center stage as Gov. Gray Davis continues to negotiate a rescue of the near-bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. The resolution is crucial to Davis' complex plan to pull California out of its costly energy crisis.  ??When the Legislature put the state in the power-buying business, it needed to ensure eventual reimbursement for its purchases. The result was the CPA, for California Procurement Adjustment, essentially the portion of customers' bills left over after the utilities subtract their cost of operations.  ??After weeks of wrangling in Sacramento, the front lines in the utility debate will now shift for a time to San Francisco, where the California Public Utilities Commission will determine the size of the CPA and the way it is to be divvied up.  ??How the commission rules will be the main factor in determining if customers of the three big investor-owned utilities--PG&E, Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric--will face rate hikes above the 19% already set in motion. It also will have a direct bearing on the state's ability to sell the $ 10 billion in bonds it needs to finance its long-term power buys without having to commit taxpayer money.  ??"What happens at the PUC is fundamental, in terms of our ability to issue bonds with investment-grade ratings," state Treasurer Phil Angelides said. "How they allocate moneys between the state and utilities will be fundamentally important to how far our $ 10 billion will go. And it will be fundamentally important if it is not done in the right way, because it will have a direct and negative impact on consumer rates."  ??Utility executives disagree with the state on how to allocate the CPA but agree on its importance.  ??"One issue is: How do you divide the pie? And an important and related issue is: Is the pie big enough?" said Ted Craver, chief financial officer of utility parent Edison International, during a conference call Friday with debt holders.  ??Before skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices turned PG&E and Edison into financial basket cases, the money left over after subtracting their costs of delivering power to customers was called "headroom," and that was where the utilities paid off past investments, retired debt and took their profits.  ??Under Davis' plan, most such money would be reserved by the state to pay off the $ 10 billion in bonds to buy electricity and reimburse the treasury for the billions the state has already spent to buy power.  ??Some consider this a gamble and wonder if there will be enough money available without either dipping into the state general fund or, more likely, raising customer rates even further.  ??Under the January law, AB 1X, that put California in the power-buying business, the CPA needs to total at least $ 2.5 billion annually from utility customers. Angelides on Thursday estimated that the state needs $ 1.3 billion from CPA funds just to service the bonds.  ??PG&E and Edison both say they believe the utilities are entitled to be paid first out of ratepayer bills under AB 1X.  ??The Department of Water Resources, the agency empowered by the state to buy electricity for utility customers, would get whatever is left over after utility expenses are covered, the two companies say. If nothing is left, rates would be allowed to rise high enough to pay the water agency what it needs to cover its electricity expenses under an interim order issued Wednesday by the PUC.  ??"If that means rate increases, then the commission has affirmed it will pass through those rate increases," said Ann Cohn, assistant general counsel for Southern California Edison. "The DWR will have to determine what its own revenue requirement is."  ??In filings with the commission, PG&E, the state's largest electric utility, insists that once its obligations are subtracted the CPA would be virtually penniless. The most financially troubled of the utilities, PG&E is believed not to have ruled out filing for bankruptcy as a way out of its $ 8-billion debt.  ??What percentage the commission allots PG&E from customer bills could be a factor in the utility's decision about seeking protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.  ??Meanwhile, Davis is faced with a dilemma of his own that is no less wrenching. For his rescue plan to work, four things must happen:  ??* The cost of electricity purchased by the state must be reduced through long-term contracts.  ??* The amount of money paid by the utilities to alternative-energy suppliers--generators of solar, wind and other forms of power, which constitute about one-fourth of the electricity used by utility customers--must be cut in half.  ??* The utilities must agree to sell electricity to the state from their own generators, including nuclear plants and hydropower facilities, at slightly above cost.  ??* And the state must obtain favorable rates on its massive bond sales.  ??Although some progress has been made on all these fronts, none have been finalized.  ??For example, Davis announced a week ago that 40 long-term supply contracts had been negotiated with major generators at terms favorable to the state. But by Friday, fewer than a dozen of the contracts had been signed.  ??Moreover, because of the secrecy the Davis administration has imposed on details of the contracts, it is impossible to tell if the prices negotiated by the state are low enough to be covered by the $ 10 billion in power bonds beyond September.  ??Several California newspapers, including The Times, have been denied by Davis in repeated requests to obtain details under the California Public Records Act. On Friday, Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) said he plans to file a lawsuit today demanding that contract details be disclosed.  ??If any one of the four key fronts blows up on Davis, the governor would then be faced with either dipping into the state budget surplus or asking the PUC to raise rates beyond the level now in motion. The currently programmed average 19% hike comes from a temporary 9% increase approved by the commission in December (and generally expected to be made permanent) and a further 10% boost by next March (when a rate rollback ordered under the state's 1996 deregulation law expires).  ??Davis has publicly opposed using tax funds to bail out the investor-owned utilities, on grounds that such a move would be unfair to customers of municipal utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, that remain financially healthy.  ??In its action last week, the PUC made clear that if enough money is not found in the CPA to repay the Department of Water Resources, then customer rates would have to rise.  ??While acknowledging that it will be a close call, administration officials last week repeated their contention that the governor's rescue plan can be accomplished without raising rates beyond the 19%.  ??"Conceptually, I'm confident that the CPA mechanism operates in a manner that gets us appropriate bond capacity," state Finance Director Tim Gage said.  ??Angelides warned that the state needs to be wary of the utilities' taking more than their fair share.  ??"As the final divisions of the pie are made," Angelides said, "the utilities should recover no more out of that pie than the actual cost of generation plus their regulated return, and the state must be accorded the balance."   ??*  ??Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story.

 Greetings Mark:  Here is the latest.  ENA signed a short-term deal (5 -week term, I believe) with DWR that goes through the end of the month, at which time we have the option to extend the deal to a five-year term.  We are discussing other longer-term deals, too.  As Steve points out, we've had serious concerns regarding DWR's creditworthiness.  (DWR, the Dept. of Water Resources, is the state agency that Davis made the purchaser of power when the utilities hit the financial skids a few months ago and the market stopped selling them power.)  The problem has been simple and significant---while our brilliant Governor and Legislature gave DWR the authority to buy power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities, they neglected to t spell out how DWR would recover its costs of buying the power.  Based on comments from us and other suppliers regarding the creditworthiness issue, the California PUC issued an order last week establishing that 1) the PUC would indeed pass DWR's power costs through to ratepayers and 2) the PUC would NOT second-guess (i.e., impose "reasonabless" standards) on any contracts signed by DWR as a condition of passing the costs through to ratepayers.  With the CPUC decision (and other language that ENA's negotiated into the DWR contract), ENA is close to being comfortable signing the 5-year deal, even in the face of the FERC order.  That's predominantly due to the fact that the power price in the 5-year deal would come in well under the $150/MWH threshold that FERC has set up for any sort of "refund review."  But other things could crop up between now and the exercise date that could muck things up. I'll keep you posted on developments  as they transpire.  The big problem (as Steve notes) is that the State is on the verge of (some say hell bent on) taking over the entire electricity industry in California in perpetuity.  Our original proposal focused on getting price volatility and the utilities' financial position back under control.  Our contracting proposals have always been couched in the context of a temporary, stop-gap measure.  That is, the state would do the minimum amount needed via contracts to stabilize prices while simultaneoulsly doing what was necessary to get de-regulation back on track in California.  And once the situation had been righted, the State would as soon as possible exit the industry and let the market step back in.  Unfortunately, command-and-control, anti-deregulation policymakers have taken hold of the agenda (with the blessing, seemingly, of the Governor), and are moving the state toward a "takeover" response.  That's what we're actively opposing.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff

 Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone, Inc.  He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me to him.  He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the Legislature to establish an "Enterprise Zone" energy tariff to encourage investment in California's Enterprice Zones.  Before I launch on the effort, just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 nope.    Joseph Alamo 03/12/2001 04:04 PM 
 Greetings Michelle:  As we talked about it last week---and now that I'm back in the office, I'm having folks check to make sure that this is 100% accurate:  Rates for core subscription customers are forecasted (I believe based on previous month's gas prices). Bills for core subscription customers are lagged (I believe by 30 days after consumption). The IOUs face a PBR mechanism that incents them to buy index (though they may have engaged in a modest amount of hedging). The California PUC issued an order (about 2 months ago) prohibiting noncore customers from switching to core subscription status.  I'm back in the office today, and have folks checking on this.  I need to pin down with certainty 1) the forecast period, and 2) the bill lag period.  Will get back to you as soon as we get the info.  If there's anything, just let me know.

 If you're referring to the conversation we had on today's call, it's actually a bill by Dede Alpert (sp?) that, if signed by the Governor, would cause demand to go up.  Were you referring to that or something more general?  Best, Jeff    Janel Guerrero 03/13/2001 06:47 PM

 Greetings:  Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.  Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project on Thursday.  I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and merger/valuation analysis.  Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would like to do, I can certainly suck it up.  Any thoughts?  Best, Jeff

 Hey Buddy:  Hope your weekend was nice.  Tried to call, but I think your voicemail is messed up out there today.  Checking in to see whether Hoecker said it or not.  Any word?  Also, looks like we're on for Portland next Tuesday/Wednesday.  Would definitely like to gather (phone call or something) prior to the meeting so we (me, you, Rick, Richard) are clear on what our goals are for the meeting and what the agenda needs to look like.  Finally, I should have a draft of my "Tech Section" ready by tomorrow sometime.  That was our deadline, correct?  Any other follow-info from last Tuesday'Wednesday's meeting that I should be aware of?  Finally, you see Harry's note?  Can you make a call to discuss the PG&E strategy on Wednesday?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll be there.  Thanks.

 Kirsten:  I've made two small changes. Moved the last sentence in paragraph 5 to the second sentence in paragraph 6.  I think it makes more sense there. I've modified the last sentence in paragraph 10 to be what I think is a more accurate statement.  It now reads: "It could instead prohibit further direct access arrangements as of the issuance of the order, when and if that occurs, or as of some other unspecified date in the future.

 Hi Katie: Thought IEP folks might be interested. Best, Jeff  Wednesday March 14, 12:22 pm Eastern Time  US Senate rejects California utility bankruptcy measure By Patrick Connole  WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a bid to force California utility companies to repay power generators for electricity they bought under a federal government sales order, even if utilities go bankrupt.  In a motion on the Senate floor, lawmakers killed an amendment to a broader bankruptcy reform bill that opponents said was a dangerous proposal that would have opened the door to involuntary bankruptcy filings by troubled California utilities. The utilities in question are PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news) Southern California Edison.  The amendment was sponsored by Oregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden, Montana Democrat Sen. Max Baucus and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith.  Proponents said the measure would have protected the customers of the federally-owned Bonneville Power Administration and other Northwest utilities from unfair rate increases due to the California energy crisis.  ``I don't think it's fair for consumers in other Western states to get caught holding the bag if California utilities take our power and then run into bankruptcy court to avoid their debts,'' Wyden said.  ``The Northwest has been more than a good neighbor to California during this crisis,'' he said.  Interestingly, the California Senate delegation was split on the matter. Democrat Dianne Feinstein opposed the amendment, while fellow Democrat Barbara Boxer supported it.  Feinstein called the proposal a ``dangerous amendment'' that would create two classes of creditors and ``probably force an involuntary bankruptcy.''  The broader bankruptcy reform bill is expected to be approved by the Senate by the end of the week.  Separately, talks between California and its three investor owned utilities on a deal under which the state might buy their transmission assets continued this week with no deal in sight.  The state is negotiating with PG&E and Edison, along with Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric.  The deals are aimed mainly at pumping money into PG&E and SoCal Edison to keep them out of bankruptcy after they recorded about $13 billion in red ink since last spring, paying sky-high prices for power in the wholesale market.  PG&E and SoCal Edison, under the terms of the state's disastrous experiment with market deregulation, have been able to pass on to their retail customers only a fraction of their power purchase costs.

 Well done.  One other point:  If the PUC rules on the 27th that the rate freeze is not going to end retroactively, that should put Ken Lay in a much stronger position to negotiate with Glynn on reaching a deal on payment.  Best, Jeff 
 Nokia Expects to Meet Earnings Forecast Despite Lowered Sales, Industry Outlook Dow Jones Newswires HELSINKI, Finland -- Despite market conditions that have cut into its sales growth, Nokia Corp. said Thursday that it expects to meet its earnings target for the first quarter of 2001, thanks to better-than-anticipated profit margins. Nokia estimates it is likely to earn 19 European cents a share in the first quarter, in line with estimates it provided in January. Nokia's shares received a boost from the statement, rising 2.60 euros, or 11%, to 27.15 euros in early-afternoon trading in Helsinki. In midday trading in the U.S., shares of Nokia were up $3.20, or 15%, to $25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it expects year-on-year sales growth in its networks division during the first quarter to be 30% to 35%, and 15% to 20% in the mobile-handsets division. Total sales growth is expected to be around 20%, the company said. That is lower than the 25% to 30% sales growth the company forecast in January, when it released full-year results for 2000. The company said it has had to confront "difficult market conditions," particularly in the U.S. "We feel confident about our strengths and our performance during the early months of the year," Nokia Chairman and Chief Executive Jorma Ollila said. "Despite the more difficult market conditions, we have been able to show good progress. We expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole, with better-than-anticipated margins." As a result of the tougher conditions, Nokia said it now expects global handset sales for 2001 to be between 450 million and 500 million units. It had previously forecast a range of 500 million to 550 million units, saying sales near the bottom end were more likely.  1Motorola Announces More Job Cuts In Wireless-Phone Handset Business (March 14) 2Ericsson Issues Profit Warning Amid Sagging Economy, Sales (March 13) 3Ericsson to Outsource Handset Sector to Stem Losses in Consumer Goods (Jan. 29)  Just last year, manufacturers were expected to sell about 650 million cellphones world-wide in 2001, but the industry is slumping as many consumers delay buying or upgrading their phones. Nokia's statement comes three days after Swedish rival Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson warned that it expected a substantial loss in the first quarter because of slowdowns in both its handset and networks businesses. And Motorola Inc. of the U.S. said Tuesday that it will slash 7,000 jobs in its cellphone- and pager-manufacturing business, and will take a still-unspecified charge against first- and second-quarter earnings. Including the latest cuts, Motorola has set plans to eliminate 18,000 jobs since December, or 12% of its 147,000-member work force. Ericsson, meanwhile, has taken the unusual step of deciding to outsource its entire phone production to a third party -- a major retreat by a company once famous for manufacturing the most-sophisticated cellular phones in the world. Nokia said it has reacted to the changing market conditions by accelerating programs to improve efficiency and cut costs, but it didn't provide details. The company also said it has widened its market share in the handset market above the 32% it achieved in 2000. And it said its own stock levels, as well as the stock levels of Nokia phones already shipped to stores, are lower than at the end of 2000. "More challenging times like these test your mettle as a company," Mr. Ollila said. "We believe that truly great companies emerge from challenging times much stronger." The company said it would comment further on its performance on April 20, when it releases first-quarter results.

 Greetings:  Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained that the situation would be resolved.  The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot of large ("noncore") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.  Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to respond to the following:  Have you "stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know  how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the non-core customer(s) the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those contracts."  There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers back to utility service in California.  Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've expired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 Great points.  Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity.  That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this "study" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it.  I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose:  to influence the policy decision currently under debate "To de-regulate or not."  As such, I wouldn't see issues like "PJM or APX" or "competitive default supplier or not," or "divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets" being the focus.  That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in "Round 2," once the initial debate over "deregulate or not" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, "right" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably.  And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment.  In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating  implementation may be moot.  Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on "how to do it," but that would not be the emphasis.  In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of "to deregulate or not," and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study.  I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the "go/no go" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 03/16/2001 08:22 AM 
 Jim/Jeanne: Do we know what case this request has been made in and if we're one of the 5 listed?  Thanks. Best, Jeff 
 State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom Hannigan. To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much California is spending on power purchases. Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw it. "I don't think it was a surprise," said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- Redding. Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in Davis' proposed budget. Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans to rise. "This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that tracks state spending. "Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look like in the future." The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per megawatt hour. Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. "That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time," he said. "Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be." The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could force up the price the next day. But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right to know how its money way being spent. "People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on," he said. "We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces." Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by Davis. The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional money was needed. Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water Resources document. Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a house of cards. The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every month. - Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov. Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to hear it.

 Please note marked increase in Chron's quality of reporting when it ain't Lazarus doing the reporting.  This was the lead, front page story in the Chron.  Note Abraham's quote in p.#3 re: "must increase supply or decrease demand."  I've heard that somewhere before.  Best, Jeff   Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable' Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/16/MN20 0965.DTL Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts "appear inevitable" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said. "Let me make one point clear," Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "Any action we take must either help increase supply or reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis." Abraham said electricity shortages in California "will get worse, and blackouts this summer appear inevitable." He cited projections of anywhere from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer. "I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs," he said. "But I know for sure they don't want to be sitting this summer without electricity at all. And our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary public interest responsibility of this administration." Feinstein became the first leading state Democrat to break with Gov. Gray Davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity prices low for California consumers, even as soaring wholesale costs have driven the state's investor-owned utilities to bankruptcy and now are draining the state's budget surplus. But Feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online. Feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation, saying that if people just turned off their computers at night, they would save 7 percent of the state's electricity supply. She also said the state, which now is buying electricity for the utilities, has already run through $2.7 billion and could spend $10 billion on electricity this year. "That is gone," Feinstein said. "It doesn't buy a school. It doesn't repair a road. It doesn't build the water system many of us believe the state needs." The offer came as a compromise with Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, who warned that an "economic and environmental catastrophe" awaits the Western states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a drought in the Northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power. Smith's move to embrace price controls, which he had earlier rejected, reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the Bush administration to intervene in the electricity market, as Western officials complained bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now threaten the region's economy. LESSONS OF SUPPLY, DEMAND "I'm afraid this summer we're going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers the lessons of supply and demand," said Smith, whose family owns a frozen vegetables business. "I don't want to send the wrong signals to the marketplace . . . but I'll tell you, the wrong signal is a recession." Abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the Bush administration is not doing enough to aid the West, citing a letter he sent to Davis yesterday that said the White House will not oppose the state's plan to take over the investor-owned utilities' transmission lines, despite disagreeing with the approach. "Regrettably, I think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some to suggest that the administration either does not care about California and the West or is doing nothing to help," Abraham said. "That is simply untrue." Abraham said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent order to 13 power suppliers to refund $69 million in January overcharges to the utilities would send "a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren't going to get away with it." He also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and discussions with Mexico to try to increase electricity exports from Baja to California. But Abraham firmly rejected price caps, saying they "have already been tried and already failed" in California when a price ceiling for electricity sales into the state was reduced over the past year from $750 a megawatt hour to $150. RESULTS OF PRICE CAPS "The lower the price cap was set, the higher average electricity prices rose," Abraham said, in part because municipal utilities were exempt. New federal price caps would affect just half of the Western electricity market, he said, and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets rather than control prices. He also said price caps would "almost certainly" reduce sales from Mexico and Canada and induce "cheating and circumvention." Armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year, Feinstein expressed her strong disappointment. "Oh, Mr. Secretary," Feinstein said, "I was really surprised by the ideologic hardness of your statement. I must tell you that." She said California will be 5,000 megawatts short of electricity this summer, enough power for 5 million homes. "It's a lot of shortness," she said, predicting that prices will reach $5,000 a megawatt hour. "What does California do about that if it isn't going to get any help to provide that stability and reliability over that period of time? . . . All we're asking for is help to prevent price-gouging." Abraham countered that the administration's position is "common sense." "I'm telling you, I think this summer, if California has worse blackouts than currently projected, that (price caps) would have been a disservice to the people of your state," Abraham said. "If the rest of the West finds the Canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of price caps . . . that's in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our public responsibilities here." In Sacramento, Davis said he was "particularly grateful" for the administration's promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover. He also said the state would "have just enough power to avoid blackouts" but said "federal officials are of a different view." Still, the governor continued to urge ''some effort to temper wholesale prices." E-mail Carolyn Lochhead at clochhead@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 1

 Hi Dale:  Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try to "bypass" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.  There were other forms of "bypass" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.  Give me a call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).    Glad to talk to you on Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire any follow up.  Best, Jeff    Dale Kasler <DKasler@sacbee.com> 03/19/2001 11:10 AM

 Thanks, Scott.  Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev:  Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort underway in San Diego.  Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., He'd like Erki to be the contact person.  Erik could you copy your vitals (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they can forward along to Alpert?  Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed):  The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward. Any "solution" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy. Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

 just got word that my prof's sick, so i don't have class tonite. 
 Marty:  Thanks for the information.  Getting Eric's contact information to Alpert's office is in motion. Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to complain, I wasn't clear on that action.  Likely makes sense for Eric to coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office. Letters are an attempt to influence Alpert to 1) fix the Direct Access prohibition and 2) ensure that DA customers don't get saddled with the DWR costs.  Let me know if this approach works.

With respect to the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks would like that information.  Just let me know.

 Seems to me that that's exactly what the letter is saying and represents the commitment that we've made to our customers since raising the issue of re-sourcing, i.e., they'll pay the cost embedded in the contract, period. No more and less. I've assumed that the exposure associated with the utility-sourced electricity is substantially lower than the exposure associated with the customers remaining DA customers.

 -----   Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign   Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET  ? ?     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator will "play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis." Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation.   ? "With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch," the letter said. Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of Planning and Research. The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. Lynch's failure to "ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher," the letter said. "This hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of dollars during the next 20 years." The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities. The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been released. Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. "We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," the letter said. "With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial situation." -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires;

 Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M N114450.DTL California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has learned. A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges that rates would remain unchanged. Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell the state their transmission systems and some land. The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers. The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from runaway wholesale electricity prices. The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped utilities. The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's dysfunctional electricity market. "Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment," said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that is advising Davis in the talks. "The past situation has not worked well," he added. "The utilities want some certainty about their future." TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks. An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale. "Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall," the official said. "One of the dominoes is the rate freeze." A PG&E spokesman declined to comment. In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the rate freeze for months. The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion in debt accrued as a result of the freeze. "They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in various forms," said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. "Adding it to the present talks is consistent with past behavior." Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be making progress. Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, told clients on Monday that the discussions "may have lost some momentum in recent days." He did not give a reason. For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent. SECRET STICKING POINTS "We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded, and we will work out an agreement," Davis said at an appearance in San Jose. "But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm not going to reveal." One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze. Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the additions was not realized by state officials until this week. One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates. CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking the PUC "to support the creditworthiness" of the utility. "This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital, consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions," it says. Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from ratepayers. "There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends if it is adopted," the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to disagree with such assumptions. But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch. "This is a very complex transaction," he said. "God and the devil are in the details." E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 1

 PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Wednesday, March 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M N33580.DTL Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities that buy their power return to solvency. Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or "QFs" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. "It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the money designed to compensate the QFs," Davis said. "It's immoral and has to stop." Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not paid them since November. The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings from other creditors. The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. "It is critical to keep these facilities up and online," said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. "The utilities owe it to the people of the state to pay them." Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative producers ahead of their other creditors. But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the governor's office about possible payment structures. Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash they must close their plants. "We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten the health of everyone else," said V. John White, legislative director of the Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with Edison which has paid them nothing since November. CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. "We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest employer in the county," said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. "We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen rates," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations eventually failed to move forward. E-mail Greg Lucas at glucas@sfchronicle.com and Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 10 
 California governor blames utilities for blackouts   By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press SACRAMENTO, Calif. (March 21, 2001 8:10 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - Gov. Gray Davis said the state's two largest utilities are partly to blame for this week's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators. Davis said the utilities took money from customers while failing to pay the alternative plants, which use renewable forms of energy like steam and natural gas to generate electricity. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since January to buy power for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which are so credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them. "It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not pay the generators," the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday. "They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop." The state lost about 3,100 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 3.1 million homes, on Tuesday from alternative energy plants that say they can't afford to keep operating because the utilities haven't paid their bills in weeks. Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the utilities to pre-pay future bills to the alternative plants. PG&E called Gray's statements "inappropriate and unjustified," adding that it was negotiating a payment plan with the suppliers. Edison said it is intent on paying creditors and working with the Public Utilities Commission to pay the plants for future power sales. Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers. Keepers of the state's power grid were cautiously optimistic that California might get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts after two idle plants were returned to service. "Never say never - but it appears we are going to be in better shape tomorrow (Wednesday) and for the rest of the week," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the state's power grid. About a half-million customers were hit by Tuesday's blackouts, which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into darkness from San Diego to the Oregon border. On Tuesday, Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell called on PUC President Loretty Lunch to resign. Lynch was appointed by Davis. Lynch couldn't be reached for comment, but a spokesman for the governor dismissed Campbell's complaints. Meanwhile, a leading lawmaker on energy issues said the PUC may soon have to raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities' bills. "My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able to plan for it," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley. "They don't have to like it, but I think they'll appreciate it." Davis has said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills without further rate increases. In the meantime, the ISO is counting on conservation to avoid more rolling blackouts. Dorinson estimated that conservation accounted for about 900 megawatts in savings during Tuesday's peak usage. "That probably was the difference today in helping us avoid any rolling blackouts late into the evening," Dorinson said. Tuesday's outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until about 2 p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at least one serious traffic accident. The blackouts were caused by a combination of problems, including unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the Pacific Northwest, numerous power plants being shut down for repairs and the loss of power from alternative generators. 
 Mike:  Here are my comments.  Apologies for the fact that they are quick and dirty.  All Enron's public statements that I have read, including, I think, statements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California is not "material."  Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California has been a "financial disaster," that "Enron has lost over $300 million," and that "Enron stands to lose millions more."  The losses are described as "huge."  Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the market, but I'm not aware of it.  And if it hasn't, it could represent a significant conflict with previous statements.  Seems prudent to run this by IR and perhaps others before releasing. Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy.  It would seem prudent to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to making public. Very minor technical point--I don't think that AB 1890 was passed "unanimously."  I think that there was 1 nay vote. The statement is made that "the utilities were required to sell off most of their generating capacity."  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of the remainder of their fossil-fired plants. It is stated that stranded costs are "investments in imprudent power generation facilities."  These investments were in fact found in the past to be prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them imprudent now. Is it now "virtually impossible to manage commodity risk" in California? Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation somewhat. From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing UC/CSU in the following manner, "It was actually a relatively easy decision to make."  Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed.   Best, Jeff 
 I have but one life to give for my industry....  Please see my comments on Dennis' declaration---got some serious concerns. Can you give me a ring when you get a minute 415.782.7822?  Thanks.  Jeff    Mike D Smith@EES 03/21/2001 10:32 AM

 when are comments due? 
 I think that it's a good idea.  The only red flag is the perception of marketers being in the same room together.  However, from my perspective, though it's a significant concern, it's one that can be addressed.  I would suggest running the notion by Sanders and Yoder to get their take.  Best, Jeff

   Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign   Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET  ? ?     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator will "play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis." Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation.   ? "With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch," the letter said. Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of Planning and Research. The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. Lynch's failure to "ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher," the letter said. "This hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of dollars during the next 20 years." The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities. The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been released. Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. "We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," the letter said. "With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial situation." -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires;

Might be a good idea to have GA look into that side of things.  If we feel that can be overcome, then the next big deal will be getting transportation agreements with SoCalGas.

 Court Gives Green Light to Green Generator To Suspend Edison Contract, Sell Electricity Elsewhere  Business Wire 03/22/01, 4:43p (Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)  EL CENTRO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A California court ruled today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1.  Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the Salton Sea. The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is unable to pay for power demand.  David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, "We applaud this short-term solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean, renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation."  Sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect approximately $140 million Edison owes them for power they have produced since Nov 1. The geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and legislative remedies to receive back payment, he said. "That debt will continue to place a great strain on our operation."  He added that Edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from ratepayers and has amassed approximately $2 billion in cash.  On the open market, the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in negotiations with the state, Edison and PG&E. That lower price had been incorporated in Senate Bill 47X, which stalled in the state legislature after Edison withdrew its support, and has effectively been incorporated in the California Public Utility Commission's proposed order. California taxpayers will pay the difference, because the state is buying electricity on the open market on behalf of Edison and PG&E.  "It is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our electricity," Sokol said. "That is the result of inaction by the state and bad faith by Edison. We negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions. This pricing for our clean, renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts, and less than half what we are allowed under federal law."  Sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's March 20 announcement proposing legislation and action by the California Public Utility Commission that would require Edison and PG&E to begin paying current bills for electricity received from qualifying facilities such as CalEnergy.  But, Sokol cautioned, "While we are hopeful that this legislative and regulatory action can move forward quickly, there are many details to be worked out in the governor's proposal. Even with quick action, there is a serious question whether Edison is willing to pay any of its current bills from qualifying facilities."  He noted that, like today's court ruling, the governor's proposal provides no plan or schedule to require Edison to pay the approximately $140 million Edison owes for power CalEnergy has delivered to date.  CalEnergy's geothermal complex employs about 200 workers and produces a total of 268 megawatts -- enough to supply 268,000 homes.  Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about 12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes. Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground. Magma rising in fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit. The generating plants convert the water to "live" steam, the pressure of which turns turbines to produce electricity. The plants then return the slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a renewable resource.  CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore options to collect back payments from Edison. Together, the group is owed more than $300 million by Edison.  Note to Editors: David Sokol will discuss today's ruling in a media teleconference at 2:30 p.m. PST today, March 22. Call 800/810-0924 and enter code 509085. Identify the CalEnergy conference. 
 Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.  It's a technicality.  That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another provider, the rules would require Enron to "de-DASR," after which the new provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.  The utility stands in the middle of all this.  I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU is claiming the problem is.  Might be viewed as a bit "cute" by the judge.  Also, the legislation "fixing" the prohibition passed our of policy committee today in Sacramento and is moving through the Legislature.  Best, Jeff    "Kristen Bird" <kb@quinnemanuel.com> 03/22/2001 04:40 PM 
 This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be doing.  FYI:  I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.  Sokol blasted Edison over and over (e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).  Sokol said that, at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically to force an involuntary.  Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar tack.  Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out of state).   He said he expects to get a "market price" from El Paso and that if the "prices are higher out of state, well......."  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 03/22/2001 10:16 AM

 I spoke yesterday with President Lynch's gas advisor and the PUC staffer who first got in touch with us regarding inquiries from our customer regarding whether we were returning customers to the LDCs. I described our activities generally, and explained that the originial inquiry from our customer stemmed from a mix-up (on our part) that has since been cleared up. Both seemed satisfied, appreciated the call and the information and will get back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to President Lynch's letter.

 Michele: I apologize.  I was unavoidably detained, and missed the call.  I've just returned to my office.  I would be happy to reschedule at your team's convenience.  Please forward my apologies to your colleagues and tell them I'm very sorry an any inconvenience that I caused.  Best, Jeff    <Michele_Yoskovich@mckinsey.com> 03/22/2001 02:05 PM 
 I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the following week to discuss.  Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however, holding hearings, taking a "comprehensive view" of the industry (i.e., focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity "price gouging").  They held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities underway in the Legislature.  I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship.  One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and December.  I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting the PUC to appear that it's doing something.  I'll report more on the Legislative hearings as they occur.

 Hey Sweetie: So glad to hear that you're well.  Was wondering how you were weathering the tech melt down.  I'm good.  Trying to figure out how to plant 10 acres of grapes on my land in Mendocino (rather have 10 acres of grapes than a place in S.F., I've decided---what do you think?).

 Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of the following events.  In sum:  Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom. DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 100%.  (See attached story.) Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, "don't move 8X (a bill that Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; they need much more." It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis likes it or not. The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had been informed of the "bombshell." Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.) Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.) Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market proponents, price gougers and Texans, and defending Davis and Lynch.  ****************************************************************************** *********************************************************************** Davis' Measured Plan To Fight the Darkness Michael Kahn Friday, March 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/23/E D103778.DTL COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov. Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness. Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme. The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed. -- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission? -- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could charge customers? -- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory pricing by out-of-state merchant generators? -- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity? -- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and demand? These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions. The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid, though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern California had plenty of power. The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities, pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a tangible and valuable asset in exchange. And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long failed at doing. The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and Davis' actions to enhance these efforts. California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and commercial buildings more energy efficient. The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50 percent increase in generation. And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a strong bent toward renewable power sources. In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable power sources. Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to deal effectively with the energy emergency. Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their appointments. Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president. Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange. This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it. Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty Texas- style power plants in California. Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California. Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new nuclear plants. And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants. Most disingenuously, the apologists would "let the market work," claiming that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators overcharged the state in January. Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since 1999. Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well that if the market "works" to produce New York-style rate increases in California, the consequences to the public would be dire. Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly. Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics' perspective. Michael Kahn is a member of the state Independent System Operator's board of governors. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 25  Bombshell Warning on Power Cost Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, March 24, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/24/M N176940.DTL Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent. The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without a rate increase. California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back on their feet. Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion. But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm. "There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the negotiations, this can be added up any way you want," said Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis. "Those numbers are not based on any reality right now," he said. "There are too many things up in the air." Assembly Democrats told a different story. They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell. And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration. They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the figures. PURCHASES IN BILLIONS The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year, they said. The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17 because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases. From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills. Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10 billion without raising rates. But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty rate increase would be necessary. INCREASE UPON INCREASE The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled for no later than March 2002. But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent increase would be required to cover the debt service. "For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them out. And it could mean political trouble for Davis. "Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002," said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. PG&E THREATENS SUIT The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as rolling blackouts spread across the state. The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers will resume debate Monday. Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. "These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds $1. 4 billion a month. But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. "It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way." The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to provide energy. The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid pennies on the dollar. Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries -- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Page?A - 1  Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes Critics say he should have been at Capitol Greg Lucas, Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, March 24, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/24/M N171337.DTL While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert. Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private country club of which Dauner is a member. Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento. But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small power generators -- languished in the Assembly. On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues. "There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass in Palm Springs." The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration. Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 -- averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund- raisers directed at specific industries. Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch" preceding the golf. South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying amounts of money." Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland. Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad, Perata said. "We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted." Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad. "It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the state. He appeared live from Palm Springs. The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts." Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing education and streamline college requirements for nurses. One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes. The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late bills owed to hospitals. Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on time. In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year. At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing education than anything else." Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

The proposed actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy crisis at risk. This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1, and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO). "These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "The numbers just don't work." Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months. Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive, comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers, lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded. ?

 Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook Davis favors tiered rate increases David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday, March 25, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/25/M N30195.DTL Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. "We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money," said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. "We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it, let's pay for it." Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he said, "were wildly high." "The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, " Maviglio said. "Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities, you can't conclude anything." The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. "The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. "Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large." Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. "I don't like either choice," said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. "But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts." Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within "the existing rate structure" -- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. "For the good of California, it's inevitable," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. "It's like gasoline," he said. "I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline, but that's the price of doing business." Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. "If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it," said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. "But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling blackouts." "I'd rather have blackouts," agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. "I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher." NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. "Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation," said Tom Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. "It adjusts consumer behavior," Higgins said. "People want to get their bills back down." RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. "It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this," Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No, no, no. "No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals," said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "We need to get back to a regulated system." Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. "We've paid too much already," Rosenfield said. "A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease." However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. "Big users should pay more," he said after a moment's reflection. "I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair." Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months, if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. "I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," she said. "People who use a whole lot of power should pay more." The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. "That way, you have more convenience and electricity, more stability," she said. But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas. Chronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this report. / E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

 HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger  BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein  BODY:  ??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis fails to clean up the power mess.  ??"All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down," said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. "If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that could be problematic."  ??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters understand Davis didn't create the problem.  ??"It won't be solved in six months," South said. "This is an immediate problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year process to get this situation back under control."  ??As for the governor's critics, "I think they should be asked to produce their own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read about in the newspapers have no plan."  ??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage.  ??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the state's congressional delegation.  ??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised to make the hallmark of his first term.  ??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.  ??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento who won't be attending to quip, "We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We don't need to go to Disneyland for that."  ??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled the events of the past week. "In many ways, he appears to have gone politically tone deaf," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate University. "His instincts are not serving him well."  ??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them that a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis, Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign.  ??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for months, Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature.  ??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. "I'm glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks," said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. "There's a high level of frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is."  ??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control. "No one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to do."  ??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and Democrats remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are blocking efforts to cap prices.  ??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted Davis could weather the electricity crisis. "People who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't have any plausible alternatives," he said.  ??"My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on (Davis)."  ??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare, pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.  ??"The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are," he said. "That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this summer."

 Davis Blames Crisis On State Republicans But Democratic controller points at governor Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writers Sunday, April 1, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/01/M N154353.DTL Anaheim -- The politics of energy dominated the state Democratic convention yesterday, as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled Gov. Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen Connell. Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a constant reminder of yesterday's Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California's energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate greedy energy firms selling power at "out of control prices." He insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary, refusing to say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the Public Utilities Commission last week. He suggested, however, that he favors a system of tiered electricity pricing. "These Republicans -- who were so enamored with deregulation just five years ago -- have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean up their mess," the governor said to tepid applause from the 1,900 delegates. "This deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator, passed by a Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and implemented with undue haste by a Republican PUC." But the governor's Republican-bashing was overshadowed politically by an attack by state Controller Connell, a candidate for Los Angeles mayor -- who rejected what she called Davis' "finger-pointing" and assailed his handling of the crisis. The dramatic development demonstrated both deepening rifts within California's ruling party and the high political stakes of the energy crisis. "There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state, because we dominate state government," Connell said in a convention speech in which she also outlined proposals to require "power hogs," such as malls, to install their own microgenerators. "I spent the past eight years making sure the state had a surplus, and now I'm seeing it eaten away every day by energy costs. . . . Whatever solution (the governor) provides must come fast and be shared openly with the people of California," she said in a dig at Davis, who has been criticized for moving too cautiously and for resisting disclosure of energy contracts to the public. Warning of the costs of "a delay and an incremental approach to an indefinite problem," she said, "I won't stand by and allow the consumers to pick up the tab." DAVIS DEFENDS POLICIES Asked to respond to Connell's critique, Davis told reporters, "I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this problem. . . . We've kept the light on most days." The governor, who endorsed Connell's opponent, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor, then added, "It might be if she's not happy with that, she can run for governor next time." Garry South, the governor's senior political adviser, was even more caustic, lambasting Connell as a party infidel. "This is why Kathleen Connell doesn't have a friend in all Los Angeles," he said. "She's been picking on the governor since day one." "It's all air," he said of her talk. "Not only hot air but a foul wind." In an interview while campaigning later in the day, Connell toughened her rhetoric, saying, "The emperor has no more clothes here in California." "We are well into the fifth month (of the energy crisis) and we have yet to find any answers from the administration," said Connell, who promised to release her own detailed solutions to the crisis next week. Unlike many Democrats at the convention, festooned with "Wilson Did It" signs, she rejected as "irrelevant" the suggestion by Davis that Republicans were to blame for California's energy woes. "Californians are wearying of this finger-pointing and closed-door negotiations and extended debate," she told The Chronicle. "The public is no longer going to be patient with us. They're going to hold the governor accountable when they get the bill." CONNELL LAGGING IN POLL Connell, who is forced by term limits to give up her post as controller next year, has lagged in her campaign to become mayor of Los Angeles. With 10 days to the election, a recent poll showed her running fourth behind City Attorney James Hahn, Villaraigosa and businessman Steve Soboroff. Despite Davis' words and speculation among delegates, Connell denied she was eyeing the governor's seat for the future. "I'm not looking two or three years down the line," she said. "But I hope the governor is looking toward an immediate solution to this problem." The governor's speech was his first since the PUC announced rate increases of as much as 46 percent. Davis refused to say whether he would support the immediate rate increase approved by the PUC but suggested that he would back a tiered billing system. "If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor," Davis said. "I'll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who conserve the most and 'motivate' those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut back." He later dodged reporters' questions about specifics, repeatedly saying that within the next two weeks he would release a statement detailing "what, if any" increases were needed. "Many advisers from Wall Street are running numbers, and they appear to be different from the PUC's," he said. Davis also said he has already done a lot to address the crisis and had "kick started" construction of new power plants and successfully promoted conservation programs. Some of Davis' backers at the convention, watching the squabbling, expressed concern about some of the governor's tactics. "People want a leader to lead," said Susan Leal, San Francisco's city treasurer. "They're looking for someone to come out and take command, regardless of who started this." But, she said, Davis is a tough and smart politician, and "people are still going to be forgiving if (the governor) does something to attack the problem." OTHER DEMOCRATS BLAME GOP Other Democratic Party leaders were also quick to defend Davis and to blame Republicans. Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested that President Bush has ignored California's energy problems because "he's worried to death about Davis running for president." California is the world's sixth-biggest economy, McAuliffe noted in an interview, and Bush "has basically written it off, saying, 'Good luck to you. You're not getting any help.' " Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Davis "is attacked every day by the backbench Republican yahoos in the Legislature" and predicted that public concern over energy would ebb by next year's election. "We're looking at issues that are going to transcend the energy issues we see now," Torres said, such as crime and violence in the schools, economics, the environment and abortion. But political analyst Sherry Bebich Jeffee said Connell's criticism was evidence of a party split and perhaps "the opening salvo in 2002," when Davis is up for re-election. Davis's entire party, she said, could be in trouble if voters get fed up with higher energy bills. "Do the math," said Jeffee, noting that Democrats hold all but one state office and control of the both houses of the Legislature. "If you're going to throw the bums out, the bums in this state are mostly Democrats." E-mail Carla Marinucci at cmarinucci@sfchronicle.com and John Wildermuth at jwildermuth@sfchronicle.com.

 Hi Jason:  Per my voice mail, here's the package of materials for customers to use to make sure key policy makers know that maintaining customer choice in California is critical.  As I mentioned in the voice mail, the Legislature's likely to move this week on a variety of fronts, so it's important that the business community make its voice heard immediately and clearly.  If you could forward this along to the SVMG members, it would be very helpful to the fight for cusomer choice and greatly appreciated.  Information on how to contact the key legislators is included.  Also included are "form" letters that folks can print out, sign, and send.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff

 got message  call if you can 415.782.7822. 
 My understanding is that it's languishing but still has a decent chance of getting through.  The question is when.  I'll try to get some more firm information and get back to you later in the afternoon.  Best, Jeff 
 Any news from the litigation front with UC/CSU? 
 This should help Prentice's chances for employment come the Fall.  You guys should have a HUGE phone bill on your room charges.  Please fax me a copy of the bill.  I will cover all phone charges.

 That's so weird.  Prentice left her car door ajar (when she went to go to school yesterday morning, it was dead and she had to get a jump).  I was surprised that the phone was only 300 pesos.  I thought they'd charge by the minute, but apparently, it's a flat 10 pesos for local (i.e., 800 calls), no matter how long one's one.

 Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms   (Published April 4, 2001) There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that envelops California's energy crisis. Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals for blame. No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis have gone into semihibernation. Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will backfire. "Just remember Jimmy Carter," state Controller Kathleen Connell warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have "no excuses" for perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. "We will be accountable on Election Day 2002," she said. Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his actions, saying, "I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this problem," and trying to pin blame on Republicans. Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis Davis. The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled "Meeting the Energy Challenge" to defend the governor's actions, it's apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

Best, Jeff  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Market Participants,  Attached is the California ISO's revised third RFB for Loads with emergency back-up generators that wish to participate in the ISO Demand Relief Program (DRP).  The ISO would especially like to thank the participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the first DRP RFB and encourages those participants to submit bids for this revised RFB.  As mentioned in the March 30 Market Notice for the second DRP RFB (for Loads not using back-up generators), the design of the back-up generator program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first DRP RFB. Loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the DRP Load blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month, similar to the Load portion.  Successful bidders will start in the program either June 1 or July 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized.  Bids are due to the ISO on May 1 in accordance with the attached RFB.  This RFB will also be posted on the ISO Home Page (www.caiso.com) in the next 24 hours.  <<DRA Third RFB BUG 010403.doc>>  - DRA Third RFB BUG 010403.doc

 Energy Firms' Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry  Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also predicting bigger profits for investors.  By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers  In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc. executive, would ensure "maximum customer savings" and "low-cost power." That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost revenue and stock value. "We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes across the gas and power market," Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson declared in a publication targeting large investors. "The energy marketplace," he predicted, "will simply get more volatile." Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and public records shows. In the years since California's pioneering deregulation plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers. Now, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate revenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate committee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power market. "How you can tell your investors you're about to make a whole ton of money in the very short term, and tell the consumers of California you're about to get lower rates?" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney who is heading the legislative probe. Investigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are continuing, but remain largely secret. The Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet of alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to begin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin hearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the power companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.  Suppliers Deny Misleading Public The legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively to expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of dollars by the power suppliers. "Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there is, we need to find out about it," said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), the committee's ranking Republican. Another panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all companies try to maximize profits. "But [we want] to understand how the market was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market." The power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading signals to the public. "Hogwash," said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy. Spokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of their executives. The companies maintain that California's problems stem from soaring electricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty deregulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. "You have a flawed structure there," said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa. Sousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the general public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered competition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to both make money and cut rates. Still, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the promises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings and stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared. "The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to 'Trust us, we're going to lower your rates,' they were planning the entire time to raise the rates," said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a class-action lawsuit against the power companies. Just last month, California's independent grid operator reported that many power sellers "used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible prices." Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion. The Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators were providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of determining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up electricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek internal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits to rise under deregulation. Members also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in outlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities. Some of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts. "What did they know that the rest of us didn't at the time they were purchasing those generations facilities?" asked Dunn. "They knew something." One thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power supplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time. "They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike upward," recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company pitches. "California was one of those places because it didn't have sufficient [power] plants." Duke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company says it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to spokesman Williams. However, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant purchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said in a press release it would "deliver greater value" to California customers. The publicity spin was similar when Edison's sprawling beachfront power plant in El Segundo changed hands the following year. "Consumers in California will begin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant economy," announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based NRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.  Big Growth Was Predicted Utilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer windfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas & Electric's top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. "There is no product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price trajectory into the future." But to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing revenues. Atlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan to buy plants and market power had brought the company to the "doorstep of significant growth opportunities." "We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return available," Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after buying three California plants. Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and assumptions directed to Wall Street were "just a different way of delivering the same message." The firm was saying it would be "reliable to shareholders and reliable to consumers." Now, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal and state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the power market too hard. Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence of $124 million in "unjust and unreasonable" charges during the severest periods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being too lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money or further justify the charges. Some firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were justified. Investigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel the complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies closely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas from the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power market. Whether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and tenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and Republicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power market went haywire. "I haven't seen that much smoke where there hasn't been a fire," Dunn said.

 You might be right.  Apologies if that's what happened.

 I need to check more, but here's my take.  Politically---very popular with legislators; very easy to pass, etc.  However, it would be so complicated to implement and is very likely in conflict with so many federal laws, that I think they'll have an extremely difficult time pulling it off.  In addition, the utilities (whose retained generation collected a big portion of the "windfall" selling through the PX) would be subject to a big tax hit.  Would that push them into bankruptcy?  In short, easy to pass politically, pretty difficult to make stick legally.  This help?  You still have your PCG position?  Best, Jeff    Michelle D Cisneros@ECT 04/04/2001 03:24 PM

Best, Jeff  Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product 2001-04-04 17:19 (New York)    By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise, knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more important. For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based commodities trading network. In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders manage the credit risk. Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format. Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known as the "Enron cost of credit." The rating is expressed as an interest rate. The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy and other related information. While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has turned the product into a new revenue stream. Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for a fee. The site also can sell a user a "digital bankruptcy swap," which is a way to hedge against credit exposure. The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against. For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately. According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity. The tool is important because "in just a short amount of time, a company's credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight." At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could increase. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166

 Can you define "off line?"  You mean they're going to "island' themselves, no longer taking power from the grid?

 Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk:  I'm in charge. Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis (likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to continue that charade). It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get through it. Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be likely. Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault. Windfall profits is a good idea.   Kari Dohn of the Gov's office  and I have been trading voicemails.

 HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address State  BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN   DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.  BODY:  ???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.  ??Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.''  ??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live.  ??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.  ??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power. The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said.  ??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year.  ??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold it at much higher rates.  ??''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.  ??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California.  ??''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price. Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.  ??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things companies understand is leverage.''  ??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities.  ??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities.   HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning  BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens  BODY:  ??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.  ??"I don't have any control over this," the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages.  ??"I feel your pain," Lynch replied with a smile.  ??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups.  ??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She promised to lead "a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out of the California economy and not adding a whit of value."  ??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that.  ??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate hike.  ??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.  ??Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a "failed experiment" and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that "true deregulation is our goal." The problem was that "the state stepped back too much" from management of the power system and that there had been "too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions," she added.  ??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. "We are expecting severe difficulties for this summer and next summer," said Barry Sedlik, a Southern California Edison manager.  ??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the electricity problems are spreading. "This may go on for a while and it's not just California," he said. "In the near term we've got chaos," he added.  ??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President Bush's brother is governor.  ??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage, could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in an interview.

          April 4 , 2001 Interested in subscribing to the Forecast? ?      UCLA FORECASTERS SEE NATIONAL RECESSION AS INEVITABLE IN 2001; CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE IMMUNE, WITH BAY AREA VERY SUSCEPTIBLE      ? LOS ANGELES --Economists with the UCLA Anderson Business Forecast see even more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 2001 and project a 90 percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an end no later than the first quarter of 2002. "The year 2001 is a transition year that will take the U.S. economy from the Internet Rush of 1996-2000 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 2002," said Edward Leamer, UCLA Anderson Business Forecast director and Anderson School professor. However, getting from here to there will involve some painful adjustments, he warns, and "monetary medicine" from the Fed won't stop the pain this time. According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, the probability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent since December 2000. Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recession was the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecast made that quarter. "The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investment opportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to have a cool website. Fear was a big motivator. Internet firms feared losing first-mover advantage. Bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out to pure Internet business models. Almost every enterprise in the U.S. invested heavily in IT equipment and software, and hired the associated personnel," said Dr. Leamer. "Things are different now." The national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology and software has different implications for the principal regions of California. A recession is quite likely for the Bay Area, while Southern California will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright recession. Dr. Tom Lieser, author of the California Forecast, expects to see a "high-tech" recession in California that will have a disproportionate impact on the San Francisco Bay Area. "We will most likely see not only a slowing of demand for electronics, communications equipment and related products, but also a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries," said Dr. Lieser. The UCLA economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 2002, with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates. A substantial slowdown in the California service sector -- a mainstay of the state's economic growth -- is also quite likely. "The strong increase in residential building permits seen during the November-January period will likely be short-lived," said Dr. Lieser. "We expect to see declining home prices in the Bay Area this year. Southern California will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price increases." Higher energy prices, the economists argue, may pose a greater problem for other states than for California, because of the state's lower per capita consumption. On a per capita basis, California ranked 49th out of 50 in electricity consumption and 26th in natural gas consumption, both in 1999. Even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile, it still ranks only 15th out of the 47 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption. And while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect California incomes and employment in the short term, a prolonged electricity crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run. The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast is the most widely followed and often-cited forecast for the state of California, and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and Southern California, and the strength of the state economy's rebound since 1993. The Forecast was presented at an all-day conference at Korn Convocation Hall at The Anderson School at UCLA. In addition to providing the outlook for the state and national economy, the conference examined the economic impact of California's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the nation's most prominent authorities. Speakers included Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Mark Bernstein, senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation, Barry Sedlik, manager, economic and business development, Southern California Edison, and Joseph M. Otting, executive vice president, Union Bank of California.

 Great job.  Congratulations.  Jeff 
 Not that I've heard. I think that we'll have to wait for the public notice (which will provide the details) to determine that piece. 
 Poll thus far: Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.  He made the decision after talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say "poor quality receivables"?).  Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase. Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't know what the position of his members is. Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports direct access.  Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going to say.  Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, e.g., equity, no cross subsidies.  Thoughts?  I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne.  Best, Jeff

 Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power to the state, a U.S. court rules. By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton BEE STAFF WRITERS (Published April 6, 2001) In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state without guarantee of payment. State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant off-line for maintenance. On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat." But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a high likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal. While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in July. The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which maintains and controls power transmissions. It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. "It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely could have a system emergency." Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but declined to specify their next move. "Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate." Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and production of electricity. The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, and that goes directly to an appellate court. The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly in debt. Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to the utilities. The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to sell to companies that are not creditworthy. But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. "My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however, that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to emergency demands for power. Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. "Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at risk." Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has jurisdiction. Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big utilities and sell its power on the open market. Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell its power to PG&E. The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents.  The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The utility said in the filing that it "retains control of its assets and is authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court."  A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

 Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.  04/06/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously described as an internal redeployment of staff. Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal computers. "The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are required for technical positions," she said. The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than expected, she said. However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue entertainment-on-demand services actively. Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment there. The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at $56.65. Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and electricity trading operation. Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, exceeding the total for all of 2000. Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to fill some other positions. 
 This thing's been floating around the web for a while.  Show's what's wrong with good ol' California.  To wit:  We want federal water subsidies so we can kill the fish and grow rice and grapefruit in the desert ("and we'll keep it all for us?"). Let's drive our freakin' gas-guzzlin' SUVs all over, but hey, who needs to invest in roads; and somebody else come quick and clean up our air from all those emissions. And we're 49th in the nation for spending on education.  Great stuff. Now, we've decided we want other state's with less sophisticated people (in places like Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico) to build power plants (and pollution) in their states to feed electricity, and dam their rivers and kill their salmon so that we can heat our hot tubs and STILL pay 3 cents a kilowatt hour. And oh, by the way, it's federal taxes and the military industrial complex which has funded CA's weapons industry and communications industry.  As no big fan of the military industrial comples, I'm just crying crocodile tears.  Generally the kind of self-righteous doo-doo that turns people off to what is an otherwise great place to be.

 NEWSMAKER PROFILE Dennis Montali Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career Well-known expert in complex cases Harriet Chiang, Chronicle Legal Affairs Writer Saturday, April 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/07/M N180032.DTL A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots in California's long, drawn-out power crisis. Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot- coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is relishing the challenge. "He's one of the best judges in the country," said Lawrence Goldberg, a San Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. "He loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court." Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes. On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say. "He's an excellent draw for the case," said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis. Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps commitment. After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968. He joined the law firm of Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert. While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community. In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California. One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with crises quickly and with few complications. He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel. When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk his dog and spend time with his granddaughter. "He's going to put his heart into this one," said Larry Engel, a veteran bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. "He's got the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence." "California," he added, "is in really good hands in having the case with him." E-mail Harriet Chiang at hchiang@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 3 When to Hold 'Em, Fold 'Em: It might be a long time before PG&E shares rebound Kathleen Pender Saturday, April 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/07/B U172804.DTL  If you own PG&E stock, you really need to ask yourself whether you're prepared to endure the agony of the next few years. When companies go bankrupt, common stockholders are the last to be paid, after trade, secured and unsecured creditors. Because there are usually not enough assets to pay off all those creditors in full, in many cases the creditors give up part of their claims in exchange for stock in the reorganized company that emerges from bankruptcy. This vastly dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. In many cases, the original shareholders end up with a small fraction of stock in the reorganized company. And that's after a protracted court proceeding that could take two to five years. During that period, there's little reason for the stock to rise. Although it was Pacific Gas & Electric -- PG&E Corp.'s utility subsidiary -- that filed for bankruptcy yesterday, stock in the parent company fell $4.18 per share to $7.20, and most Wall Street investors see little hope for a quick rebound. "This is going to be a long, drawn-out process," says Claude Cody, manager of AIM Global Utilities Fund, which owns stock in PG&E. "There is going to be negative news and positive news, and generally the negative news comes out first." Cody explains that when a company is in bankruptcy, the flow of information slows down. Many institutional investors won't own stock in a bankrupt company, and analysts stop following it. All the usual methods of valuing a stock, such as price-earnings ratios, become meaningless. Companies in bankruptcy hardly ever pay dividends. PG&E has already suspended its dividend and won't pay one as long as the utility is in bankruptcy. That's hard on people such as Lee Fischer of San Bruno, who bought PG&E stock 20 years ago. Fischer, 72, says PG&E accounted for about 15 percent of the stock dividends he depends on for retirement income. "Everybody said, 'Buy utilities, buy oil, they're always going to be there, ' " he says. "I'm pretty upset with our governor. I'm mad at PG&E. They're making decisions we have no control over. I'm already losing the money I'm putting into my monthly (utility) bills. It's not fair. My emotions are running rampant at this point." There are some reasons Fischer and other PG&E shareholders could fare better than most stockholders involved in a typical bankruptcy. For one thing, shareholders own stock in the parent company, which has some unregulated energy assets that could provide cash flow and some support for the stock price, provided that creditors of the utility can't seize the assets of the unregulated subsidiary. PG&E has taken steps to prevent that, but those steps are sure to be challenged in court -- a process that could add to the length and complexity of the utility's bankruptcy proceeding. "In most bankruptcy cases, you don't have this two-sided isolation. Shareholders are not getting money from a solvent side while there's an insolvent side," says Lynn LoPucki, a law professor with the University of California at Los Angeles. Given its size, stature, the essential nature of its product and its importance to the state's economy, some experts say PG&E's bankruptcy could be resolved relatively quickly -- maybe in two years instead of three. For the very same reasons, others say it will bog down. PG&E stock is down 77 percent from its high last September. But that doesn't mean it can't go lower. Walter Torous, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, has studied what happens to stocks after bankruptcies and found that on average, they don't do well. "You'd think that if a company announces bankruptcy it takes a one-time hit. But it continues to underperform badly over the long term. The market doesn't seem to quickly incorporate this bad news," says Torous. Torous tracked 78 large companies that filed for bankruptcy between 1979 and 1983. He found that during the first year after they filed, their stocks trailed the overall market by 38 percentage points. Over two years, they underperformed by 57 percentage points. Over three years, they trailed by almost 100 percentage points. (He explains that if the market went up 50 percent and the bankrupt stocks went down by 50 percent, they would trail by 100 percentage points). Torous says that because the companies he studied all went bankrupt around the same time, they might not be representative of companies going bankrupt during other periods. Marty Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund, points out that in past utility bankruptcies -- such as Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and Northeast Utilities -- shareholders who held on came out well, after a number of years. "In other utility bankruptcies, they've all been reorganized on the backs of the ratepayers and taxpayers," he says. Whitman, who doesn't own PG&E stock but does own secured bonds in the utility, was irate yesterday that PG&E didn't "prepackage" its bankruptcy. That would have involved getting all the parties involved to agree to a reorganization plan before filing for bankruptcy. "If they did it preplanned, they could be in and out (of bankruptcy) in six months," Whitman says. Instead, he says it could take two to three years. Mark Luftig, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities Fund, does not own the stock and considers it a highly speculative investment. "If you can put it away for three years, there's an above-average chance you'll get an above- average return," says Luftig. "Will you miss a lot of sleep in the meantime? Probably." MOODY'S GROWS NERVOUS: Debt-rating agency Moody's said yesterday that it changed its outlook on the state of California's general obligation bonds to negative from stable, "reflecting our view that the deepening electric power crisis -- compounded by (yesterday's) bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. -- has increased the risks to the state's otherwise strong fiscal and economic condition." Moody's is the second bond-rating agency to warn that it might downgrade the state's credit rating because of the power crisis. In January, Standard & Poor's put the state's credit rating, currently AA, on "CreditWatch" with negative implications. Net Worth runs Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

 Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. "The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the "precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC "should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action." Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the "extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it. Critics claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. "...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything, she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is. There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more importantly, that they will cause no further harm." The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers. "We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines," the order said [CP01-106. For starters, "the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge." Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers, it noted. "Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers," the order said. "The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction." The project would increase the "limited-term, incremental transportation capacity" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project recently went through an open season

 "The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego" (April 2001) PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000. Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that could be achieved through pricing incentives.

 Here's how I think this thing has played (is playing) out:  PG&E was very tactical. They knew that the Edison deal was imminent. They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests. They feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous once the Governor announced the Edison deal. Thus, in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that they'd have to accept the Edison deal, PG&E threw itself into bankruptcy. (Preemption seems to have been very successful, at least at this point.) So I think that they wanted everyone to know, including Wall Street and the Governor, that the decision's been made---they're going the way of Ch. 11, not the way of J. Bryson and Edison.  This make sense?  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 04/10/2001 10:22 AM

 Hi.  Any word on the mower? 
 very sorry.  hang in there. 
 Here are the components as I see them:  1999 numbers for C&I are fine; I'd do 10%, 15%, 20% reductions. Assume C&I takes its proportionate share of the DWR's net short (i.e., if C&I is 2/3 of load, then 2/3 of CDW purchases should go to C&I) You can use the average price used in the DWR presentation to Legislators to the $ amount.  The copy I've got sez that the average price for the first 5 years is $79/MWH.  That seems like the # we ought to use. Now the hard part.  The state reportedly sez that they aren't buying the entire net short---only that part that they feel like covering.  So how do we factor that in?  Not sure that we can get detailed data (but check with Alan Comnes, who might be able to provide ISO real time prices (which is where the net short (of the net short) is being filled ISO---the ISO then sends that bill to PG&E. An easier way might be to use PG&E's numbers.  In their bankruptcy announcement, PG&E sez that it's been costing them $300MM per month ($300MM * 0.67 * 0.10 =~$20MM).  We could scale this number up to account for summer purchases. Alternatively, we could use ENA's forward curve.   This is very quick and dirty (apologies) and I may have gotten something very wrong.  If I've got any fatal flaws in the thinking (which happens often), please point them out.  And if you have any questions, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff       Jennifer Thome 04/10/2001 12:17 PM

 Greetings:  Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the following.  Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC Commissioner).  Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.  Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.  Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be under considerable pressure to give in to caps).  The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the letter.  Best, Jeff

 Got it. Thanks.  Another article suggesting that we need to get our message out.  Heard Skilling and Davis are going to talk.  He sign the bill yet?  Best, Jeff    Power deregulation backfires in infancy (9.27.2000) MANY OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL WORK EVENTUALLY BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News With its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills, this coastal state's deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations, legislative hearings and a push to re-regulate the whole system. Sound familiar? Except this isn't California. It's New York, one of 23 other states that are ending what has been for decades one of government's key functions -- keeping tight control on the price of power. The great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition, which California has been largely credited with pioneering, was supposed to lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government regulated utilities. Indeed, energy officials in many states retain hope that it eventually will do that. But throughout the country, a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like Susan Peckman, who manages Peckman's Liquor Store in Pearl River, N.Y. Hers is the only state outside California so far where consumers have been exposed to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices. And she doesn't feel liberated. ``There's nothing we can do about it,'' said Peckman, who estimated that her store's electricity bill has jumped about 20 percent this summer over last year's. Faced with the option of paying it or closing down, she added, ``you're between a rock and a hard place.'' It has been four years since California became one of the first states to pass an energy deregulation law. Yet the movement to revamp the way power is sold in this country remains mired in a ``prolonged and muddled transition,'' according to a study published this month by Cambridge Energy Research Associates and the Arthur Andersen consulting firm. It's unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed. In many parts of the country, public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with deregulation, given the high prices and other problems in California and New York. Some even harbor suspicions that California has led the nation astray by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed. California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque said he encountered that attitude during a summer meeting of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Los Angeles. ``I had other commissioners coming up to me saying, `What the hell is going on here,' '' Duque said. ``They were concerned. I think their thought was, did we in California see something that was wrong with deregulation but weren't going to level with them now that they had started down the path?'' Actually, the federal government bears much of the responsibility for initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets. Hoping to encourage new sources of electricity, Congress passed laws in 1978 and 1992 that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power they use from other, unregulated energy suppliers. In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also made it possible for other firms to ship their power over the high-voltage lines the utilities owned. Consumers were looking for a change, too. By the mid-1990s, the service provided by utility firms had become a sore subject. California had some of the highest utility rates in the country, and the electrical system's reliability was under fire. If only other companies could be lured into the market to compete, it was widely assumed, prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would improve. New York, New Hampshire and Rhode Island passed laws or made administrative rulings to deregulate slightly before California, where deregulation was approved in September 1996. Rhode Island and Massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to choose which company sold them their electricity. But because of its size and much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the 1990s, California was labeled the national leader on the issue. In many ways, however, deregulation in the state has been a flop -- at least, so far. Californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since March 31, 1998, when the electricity market was officially unfettered. That ability to choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and, ultimately, lower energy prices. But as of Aug. 15, less than 2 percent of California's homeowners, businesses and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier. By contrast, in Pennsylvania -- one of 13 other states that now let people choose -- 10 percent of customers have switched. Critics say that's a misleading comparison since Pennsylvania, unlike California, gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch. Nonetheless, Pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation is working. A study in August by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge concluded that electricity competition will result in 36,400 new jobs and a $1.4 billion boost in personal income across the state by 2004. ``We do not anticipate the problems in Pennsylvania that you have out there in California,'' said Kevin Cadden, a spokesman with that state's Public Utility Commission. ``I am not nervous at all.'' A study this summer by the non-profit Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets, which promotes deregulation, found that Pennsylvania has pushed electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state. Others listed in order in the top 10 were New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. California was 16th. But consumers may have a different measure of success: whether their lights will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls are removed. Unfortunately, in the two states where prices have been fully deregulated, the evidence is not encouraging. In San Diego, the first place in California to have its state-mandated cap on utility rates lifted under deregulation, electricity bills for many consumers this summer doubled, while power blackouts also rolled through Northern California. New York's experience wasn't quite as bad. But in the few counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this summer, the average residential bill rose 22 percent. Investigations are under way in California and New York to determine what happened. Nonetheless, the problems in both states have been largely blamed on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for electricity, which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever power-producing firms want to charge. ``It's the piece that the economists missed'' when deregulation was touted several years ago, said Mike Donovan, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., which supplies power to Susan Peckman's Pearl River liquor store, among other parts of New York. ``There isn't sufficient generation to really administer a full-scale competitive market.'' Ralph Cavanagh of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from competition. Once that and some other problems are fixed, he said, ``I'm confident we'll have a more orderly market in the future.'' Others are growing nervous, however. This summer's difficulties have spurred calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in North Carolina, Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama, among other states. A Wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read aloud a story about California's energy crisis, noting that such news made her opposition to deregulation much easier. ``I am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the choice model,'' said Ken Malloy, president of the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets. But he acknowledged that the experience in San Diego and New York ``is undeniably a bad thing that has happened to this movement, and it will set us back.''

 In Idaho, Western states press feds to act on power prices H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/04/10/nation al1812EDT0713.DTL (04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- High electricity prices pose a ``looming disaster'' for many states in the West, a federal regulator warned Tuesday, as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price controls on wholesale power. Officials from 11 Western states, including energy-ravaged California, engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over how to contain soaring power prices that are expected to go only higher this summer. ``Something has to be done to tame this market,'' Geoffrey Brown, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, told the three FERC commissioners. California anticipates paying $65 billion for electricity this year, almost 10 times its power bill in 1999. But after the daylong session, the FERC seemed to be not much closer to imposing price caps than before, although one commissioner, Linda Breathitt, said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed. FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, reiterated his fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power generation. Under FERC rules, it would be Hebert's discretion when or if to propose a price cap for deliberation. Commissioner William Massey, who has been in the minority on the commission in recommending price controls, said the ``passion for markets must be tempered with common sense.'' ``We face a looming disaster,'' he declared, if wholesale electricity markets are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of the West selling for 10 times what it cost just a year ago. Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million in refunds on California power sales. He also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of tracking market abuses. The chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided over whether the government should regulate electricity prices. Keeping tabs as each participant gave a presentation, he said three states were for them, five against and three uncertain. Hebert's anti-controls position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a telephone interview with Associated Press reporter David Ammons in Olympia, Wash. ``The problem with price caps,'' Cheney said, ``is that they don't solve the problem. Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&E into bankruptcy.'' Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had debts of $9 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. California, whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices throughout the West, urged FERC to immediately impose an 18-month cost-based price cap in the Western markets. ``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' said Bob Hertzberg, speaker of the California Assembly. He cited state actions to boost conservation, increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is ``no earthly reason'' why energy prices should be 10 times what they were a year ago. Still, California officials expressed little optimism after the hearing. ``It would take a dramatic, unprecedented change of direction'' for the FERC to adopt price controls, said Fred Keeley, speaker pro tem in the California Assembly, who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting. Breathitt, the FERC's third commissioner, who has not come out in favor of price caps, nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls. She said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price implementation plan.'' The issue may end up, however, being decided by two new commissioners recently nominated by President Bush -- Pat Wood, now head of the Texas utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator. Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control. Neither nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate. While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little to address problems in the power markets. The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging unreasonable prices. FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and reasonable'' wholesale power prices. ``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said. ``Politically we're getting beat up.'' Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to deal with the troubled electricity market. Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power prices have yet to hit consumers. In many cases state officials must still give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers. On the Net: FERC Web site: www.ferc.fed.us/ ,2001 Associated Press ?

 Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities   Updated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities.  Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a four-year deal with the California State University and University of California systems.  Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices.  Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers should pick up the tab.  "It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of dollars we can provide it for," Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He later described the case as being "all about money. It's all about money."  Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems.  Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a "marketing game" with the universities' promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times more than what the electricity cost Enron.  He said lawmakers may have "left the keys in the car" when they approved California's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy crisis, "But it is still theft to steal the car."  The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose the suit.  "I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on the breach of contract claim," the judge said.  UC's annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and $20 million for natural gas.

 This seems principally to be a "help Davis now" sort of exercise, but perhaps there's a business opportunity in it for EES.  Thoughts? 
 If you need me to, I can do it.    Susan J Mara 04/11/2001 05:26 PM 
 what day you planning on golfing? 
 nope, but prentice has informed me that we need to be at david and nina's (i think around 4 pm) on sunday.  so we could either play at 9 on sunday, or in the afternoon on saturday (say 2 pm?).  your call.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 04/12/2001 10:31 AM 
 FYI.  If you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate... 
 Wow. That's fascinating. Sounds neat.  I would be very concerned, though, given the current environment about having us listed as a sponsor.  In short, I would recommend against sponsoring, at least at this point.  Best, Jeff    Susan J Mara 04/12/2001 11:06 AM 
 Thanks very much.  And, yes, I did get a haircut.  She cut a TON off.

 I don't know about the roommate info, but I do know that they go back a very long way.  Then Gov. Jerry Brown (now Mayor of Oakland) appointed Bryson to be the President of the California PUC.  Way before out time---I think that it was in the early '80s.  At the same time, Davis was Brown's chief of staff---so their relationship goes way back.  Best, Jeff 
 Is it possible to get the call-in number for the 2:30 call?  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Which attorney is this info from? 
 Greetings:  I'll be bringing the beginnings of the valuation model and an idea (for folks to beat up on) for the approach in the presentation.  Best, Jeff 
 let's talk and figure out a time.  i'm off for school now. Best, jeff 
 Agreed.  That time works for me. Jeff    James D Steffes 04/12/2001 07:46 PM 
 Can't wait for the bullets to start to fly.  Do we know what the total $ amount is to EES (if they were to book the entire credit to Enron)?  Thanks.    Marianne Castano@EES 09/28/2000 12:39 PM 
 It would be useful for me to have the opportunity to listen in on these calls.  Let me know if that's a problem.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 04/12/2001 10:04 PM 
 FYI:  I listened in on the analyst call.  Bryson made it very clear that, under the agreement, Edison would re-assume the procurement role on 12.31.02 and would "administer" (i.e., takeover) the DWR contracts.  Seems pretty clear that the State is actively looking for a strategy to exit the procurement role.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 04/12/2001 10:36 PM

 Ralph: Apologies for taking so long.  Here's the URL for the details of the MOU. Look forward to reviewing your proposal.  Regards, Jeff 
 Lemme know how it goes. 
 Sorry, been on calls.  Just got your message.  From my perspective, you got it exactly right in the note.  If you have any additional questions, just holler.  Best, Jeff 
 As I feared, Belden's on vacation this week.  I've left a message with him to call, however.  Will let you know just as soon as (and if) I hear anything. Best, Jeff 
 Amen. 
 Were you on the call yesterday---I went ballistic.  And where are you now!?! The calls underway.    Karen Denne 04/13/2001 12:45 PM 
 Ralph:  Thanks.  Really looking forward to discussing further.  The proposal is very promising.  As you can imagine, Enron's going to have two concerns:  1) ensuring that eligibility for participating in the competition is as broad as possible (paragraph #1), and 2) ensuring that the "terms specified by the Commission that will ptrotect the regulated service and its other customers from financial harm" don't unintentionally (or otherwise) have the effect of killing direct access (like AB 1890 did).  Appreciate you sharing this.  You can count on Enron's support.  (Though I understand that Enron's support these days is not the most sought after commodity---I leave that up to your judgment.  We'll be prepared to help in away way you see fit.)  Have a nice weekend.  Jeff 
 thanks for looking.  when you leaving?  congratz on being the spokesperson. if you ever want to compare notes, just let me know. 
 FEA's asking for a uniform percentage increase on top of existing rate allocation structure. 
 CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company.  CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak, peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities.  The 3-hour period would be selected by the customer.  Specifically:  Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered accordingly.  Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc. and SCE's TOU-8, etc.  Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling, distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.  (As noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission may consider opening the option to others.)  Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures.  In the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.  Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time.  Hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability.  The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding.  Labor, harvesting schedules and coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc. All bear upon such an effort.  Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy.  The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality. In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality.  These rates would apply, as now, workdays of Monday - Friday.  Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service.  The 3-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified.  Start dates should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle.  Optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.  Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.  It appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities.  In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the following is observed.  For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.  Of the 163, all but 8 can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.  The 8 would appear to require a field visit.  For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or 3% of the total are SIC 20.  Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly interval meters.  The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming.  Conclusion:  Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a significant barrier to establishing the program. 
 This is unreal.  If TW ain't on the A list, who is? 
 I'll look at it and get back to you first thing Monday. 
 I'll be getting you stuff tonite or tomorrow.  Best, Jeff    "Jackson, James (JCJA)" <JCJA@chevron.com> 04/13/2001 04:46 PM 
 Dudes: Here's my my comments to Mark's answers to the questions, and suggestions to Jimmie's model.  I don't answer the bottom line question, since we have some talking to do on the model.  Jimmie, your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow (as opposed to NI).  I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow model.  All my stuff is highlighted in yellow.  It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions).  I get at 25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions.  I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.  Others agree?  Anyway, it gives me a $3.32 share value, so I think the model's got some work.  Take a look and let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff 
 Guess I was lazier still.  Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.  31% and 40% growth rates are (I would argue) wildly unrealistic.  In addition, the capex numbers would (presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there. Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 price (though "irrational exuberance" may permit Netscape to pull it off). Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for the memo.  Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.  Great job on the case.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff    JcjCal02@aol.com 04/14/2001 11:16 PM 
 no problem.  give me a call and we can go through your list. Best, Jeff    Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 04/16/2001 10:21 AM 
 Harry:  At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it as the "base case" to start running the numbers.  Idea being that before we shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine whether the thing's got any legs.  Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case  numbers shake out, we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial groups for buy-in.  We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look like by middle of next week.  How's this plan sound?  Few other points:  We assume that bullet 6's reference to "net" means that the deferral is calculated by taking any "overcollections" and subtracting them from any "undercollections" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year. What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date?  We're assuming it's commercially driven.  We correct?  If so, what's the driver?  Same goes for the 2004 ending date. Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an "Option 2" for folks to consider.  (Though we don't think that any numbers need to be run on "Option 2" until after having completed the analysis on option 1, since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct). Option 2 would: Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking treatment. Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers "noncore," similar to the gas model in California, and force those customers to choose an ESP. Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining "core" (i.e., rez and small commercial) customers.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that I want to throw out for folks to react to:  Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down and simple as possible. When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation? In option 2, by adding the "noncore" feature, and by implementing that feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the utility's position).  This is not to say that the complications can't be worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to highlight it for folks to consider.  Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and "Option 2."  Best, Jeff 
 OK folks.  It's about 80% of the way there.  My brains are oozing out looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well.  I'll continue to check it and de-bug it.  Mark, you and I should talk, too.  (You'll note that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to do.)  Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there).  If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know.  I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to start getting the power point presentation together.  And perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend?  In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios, including Dupont, for OAT.  Does this work for folks?  Other thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 These slides look very good and good to go from my perspective.  I have no comments.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies.  My dead just fell into a million pieces.  I won't have a chance to review Jimmie's fine work (nice name for the CFO, by the way), and I've just been informed that I'll need to have dinner with our bankruptcy guy this evening (turns out we're on the unsecured creditor committee for PG&E's banckruptcy).  So I won't be able to be in class tonite.  Again apologies. Great job Jimmie, particularly in light of the Easter holiday.  Best, Jeff 
 We'll be at the party, Overture, or no Overture.  The Squaw thing ain't a problem.  No worries.  But let's settle soon.  My accounts are a little wacky these days---I'll explain later.  Thanks for letting me know.  With the playing, there's a lot of little issues that I think are no big deal, but from our weekend at Squaw, it seems that there are some major fucking huge issues that you and the mighty C needed to work out.  If you've got those worked out, then I'm all fer playing again, though the next 2-3 weeks are pretty fucking ugly.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/16/2001 12:00 PM 
 Prentice and I talked.  She's going to come back from the sports gig for the dinner party.  Don't worry to much about the ganged-up-on-thing---Prentice is cool.  She's ready to play.  She and I have been playing together (though our respective repertoires, as designed by Avram, diverge more than they converge).  We're getting pretty hot on Earl's breakdown, though.  P.S. Comes a point in one's life (like, when you're an adult), that you take personal responsibility for your actions---"my dad made me do it" must simply give way.  And "my dad made me an exquisite perfectionist" must REALLY really give way.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/16/2001 01:37 PM 
 -FYI.  This is an internal email of the SVMG.  Please keep confidential. I'll be monitoring.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** **************************************  As you know, the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing, specifically Severin Borenstein's proposal, at its next meeting on Monday. A copy of his proposal is attached. As I indicated at last week's meeting, I believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal, with certain conditions, for the following reasons:  - It provides the broadest, most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage, thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments (blackouts).  - It creates a demand response to high prices, thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers. This may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable, stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention.  - It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods.  The following is a "strawman" draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion Monday. I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible, an issue of concern to some. Also, I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting.  Thanks.  Peter Evans  ____________________________  Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage (and high prices). This gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts. Getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers. We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels (and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels) at the real-time energy price.  Our support for this concept includes the following conditions:  1. Historical consumption levels, which would be served under regulated rates, would be based on last year's use, taking into account the customer's historical load profile. Adjustments would be made for increases/decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume. Historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio (say 75% to 95%) to build in some expectation of conservation.  2. Participation  All customer classes would participate. In the absence of real time load data (i.e. residential customers), monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price.  3. Alternatives for Above-Baseline Use  It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on their own if they choose to. This could include self-generation, bilateral forward purchases, or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR.  4. Sunset  This approach should automatically terminate at the end of 2001, requiring government or regulatory action to extend it.  - RTP proposal 32901.doc

 FYI.  The agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing tomorrow includes two Brattle Group consultants, Paul Carpenter and Matt O'Loughlin. They will make up the first panel, titled, "California's High Natural Gas Prices: Market Power and Other Factors."  In California's gas wars, Edison hired these folks--Carpenter in particular-- to show that SoCalGas has considerable market power in California and abuses it.  (Edison was a long-time, very unhappy gas customer of SoCalGas', until it sold off its power plants.  The animosity remains, however.)  Should be interesting to see where the committe goes with that panel.  CA PUC lawyer, Harvey Morris, is the sole witness on the second panel. Harvey is zealous in his assertions regarding market power in interestate markets serving California and is the PUC's lead attorney on such matters at FERC.  I plan on attending the hearing.  It's likely that I will also be attending a hearing on price caps at CMA's offices in the afternoon.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: I tried to log in and the system told me that I'm not authorized to use the system. Best, Jeff

 Thanks very much, Doug.  Good to see you yesterday. Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Steve.  I'll coordinate with Rosie.  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 04/19/2001 12:31 PM 
 Apologies.  I need to get off and do this new assignement that Kean just gave me.  Jeff 
 Greetings Professor:  Apologies for asking, but something has come up and I wanted to inquire about the chances of taking the E203 final on a day other than Sunday the 10th of December.  Preferably Tu, W, Th, the week of the 11th.  Best, Jeff 
 Bob:  I'm not going to be able to make this time (particularly given the assignment that I just got from Kean).  Can I catch up with you after?  Best, Jeff    Jan Cooley/ENRON@enronXgate 04/19/2001 01:41 PM 
 You mean fighting the MOU? 
 Jennifer.  I apologize.  I have to turn to assignment that Steve Kean just gave me.  I made it almost all the way through the document.  You did a fantastic job under the circumstances and given the time constraints.  If I can get Steve's assignment finished quickly, I will turn my attention back to this.  Hope it helps.  Best, Jeff 
 Crudely put (my apologies), I think it goes something like, "don't sacrifice the $200+ billion US electricity market for a $150 MM claim."  (Akin to the "domino theory" applied to the electricity market.)  That make any sense?  Best, Jeff    Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate 04/19/2001 02:13 PM 
 Hmmm. FYI.  Dear old Edison. 
 Shoot.  I'm sorry.  Is this what you called to discuss?  I'm here.  (with a "need yesterday" assignment from Steve).  Give me a call at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Will do.    Susan M Landwehr 04/19/2001 03:00 PM

 Greetings.  I'm back from vacation.  Trading voicemail with Jessie Knight (trying to get him to appear at the hearing).  If there's anything else you need me to do---call Ms Van Way, etc.---just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Look forward to it.  I've just had two "need them yesterday" requests that I need to complete today.  Are you available tomorow to discuss further?  Best, Jeff    Kurt Lindahl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/19/2001 01:13 PM 
 Folks: My apologies.  This is not proofed, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had a chance to review and comment.  Apologies for any unintentional omissions and errors.  I think it tracks closely with the direction agreed to on the call today.  All comments are encouraged and welcome.  Best, Jeff 
 Attached is the final.  Thanks to all for help and comments.  Best, Jeff 
 See email. All comments compiled/integrated.  Final just sent.  Jeff 
 Huh? 
 Today's the 7th anniversary of the release of the California Commission's now infamous "Blue Book" that launched Direct Access.  Would it be bad taste for Skilling to note the anniversary on the call with Bryson?  Viva Choice....  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, man.    James D Steffes 04/20/2001 12:22 PM 
 Karen: See highlited section of story below.  PG&E's got it right.  Recall that DWR was only buying power that it determined was "priced reasonably." Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy. Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.  So it's therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has increased dramatically---just not for any of the bogus reasons cited by Governor Backbone.  Best, Jeff

 More recipes.  The other part would be fun to read to everyone at dinner.   STRANGOZZI WITH BLACK TRUFFLE Ingredients (4 people): 500 g of fresh hand-made strangozze, 150 g of black valuable truffle, extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, sat, black pepper and parsley. br> Preparation: Fry slightly the extra-virgin oil, the garlic and some parsley. Take the pan off from the stove, filter the spices and mix the other oil with the grated truffle seasoned with salt and black pepper. The pasta must be "al dente". Pour the sauce on the pasta and mix it on the stove at light heat for a while, then serve it guarnished with truffles slices.    The TRUFFLE history of a typical umbrian product  For a lot of people, the word truffle recalls a tuberous entity, marbled on the skin, with a nice scent, tasting delicious and it is usually associated to a good lunch, generously wet by sweet wine; for the botanics, instead, this is just the fruit spreading device of mushrooms wich adapted living in the underground. Since from the beginning truffles interested philosophers and scientists, starting fighting and discussions to whom neither very strict thinkers like Savonarola could avoid to partecipate. It is not so strange then that in the first book scientifically talking about mushrooms which has been printed, the Opusculus de Tuberis di Alfonso Ceccarelli da Bevagna (1564), was about TRUFFLES. Almost 2000 years before the Greek philosopher Teophrastus (370-287 a.C.) turned on the discussion asserting that truffles were vegetables without roots, originated during winter rains, if there were thunders. Strange theory, without doubts. The Romans were really crazy for truffles and the Latin poets Apicious and Giovenal glorified the truffles and their taste, writing also a recipes book. During the middle age it was the king on the refined tables of every king's court. In a document from Baron A. Ancaiani (1761) about the "active and passive commerce of the town of Spoleto" huge quantities of truffles sent to Florence and Venice are described. It seems they were really requested. Rossini defined it the Mozart of the kitchen and it is told that Napoleon used huge quantities of the truffle to provide a successor to his kingdom. About its botanic constitution, instead, until the late 18th century the strangest theories continued to be produced. The celeber naturalist Plinio il vecchio considered them as they were ground corns and a miracle. Bornolz (1780) thought they were an intermediate class between the animal and the vegetal kingdoms. Revel, in 1857, said the truffles were the result of a fly bite on a oak root. Just after the second half of 18th century the idea that the truffles were autonomous organisms, or better mushrooms, started to be accepted. Our Umbria keeps a rich ipogeous flora and since centuries is the first country in producing truffles, especially the valuable black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) spread around the woods around Norcia and Spoleto. The mushroom has always different dimensions and it can vary from the width of a nut to that of an orange and it is very appreciated for the intensity of the smell and the rich taste. The collecting of the tubers happens during the time between December and March. Secondary is, in these same zones, the production of white truffle (Tuber Magnatum Pico) foun in Spoleto nearby valleys, but impressive is the production of summer "scorzone" truffle (Tuber aestivum Vitt.) and even of the "hooked" truffle (Tuber uncinatum Ch?teau), which have a peculiar taste and smell. what truffles are  With the name truffle are designed mushrooms belonging to the order of tuberales (Ascomycetes), because the mushrooms have a vegetal body formed by a white mold (micelius), constituted by thousand of very thin filaments (ife). This mold lives deep into the ground and it physically unites to the roots of several plants, originating a very peculiar symbiosis called "micorriza". When the ecolocical conditions are fine, the micelius generates the fructifer bodies which are formed in a variable range of 40-50 cm. deep in the ground. They are tuber-like shaped, or sheroidal or irregular and they are about 1 to 15 cm. long. The body is made by an internal substance called "gleba" in which you can distinguish the fertile zones (darker) which carry the "aschi", a peculiar kind of spore, and in which the spores (the vehicles of diffusion for this organisms) mature, and the sterile zones (lighter) which surround the fertile zones, originating in the most evolved species a characteristic venation system. The "gleba" is protected on the outside by a variable cortical layer called "peridio", inseparable from the "gleba". The "peridio" could have its surface smooth or rough or even warted. The color could be white, yellow-like, rusty, brown or blackish. These mushrooms have several different species (about 30 in Europe) distributed in all the continents. The valuable edible species, however, are very limited. chemical composition and nutritive value  In order to give some information about the nutritive value of this mushroom, two species of truffles have been examinated: rtuber melanosporum Vitt._ (valuable black truffle from Norcia or Spoleto) and rtuber magnatum Pico_ (valuable white truffle from Piemonte or Acqualagna). The valuable black truffle has been found in the Quercus Pubescens tartufaia in january. The white one has been found close to Citt. di Castello (High Tiber valley) in Populus Nigra tartufaia in November. These two different species of truffle are not so different about their chemical composition. The proteins are the main nutrient component for the metabolism: they are complete and rich, above all of lisyn, cystin and metionin, and they are very digestible. Even the minaral composition is great. The fat are essentially unsaturated and the most important is the linoleic acid. It is pretty relevant the fiber content. how to wash truffles  Before you can use truffles, you must gently clean it from the ground with a soft brush, in order to eliminate all the ground particles. It is suggestible, before starting the operation, to keep them under warm water for a couple of minutes. This will help the ground to fall from the space between the wrinkles. The skin is edible and it must be ate excactly as the rest of the truffle, and it is very aromatic and tasty. how to preserve truffles  Once it has been found in a good condition, it is important to process the tuber as soon as possible, because it is very easy for it to decay and lose its aromatic flavour. The soulution to this problem should be left to the specialized companies. Sometimes, however, you must do it by yourself, so here are some advice: before all don't remove the ground from the cracks because it will just accelerate the decaying process, but roll every truffle in a napkin and put it in a can or a jar, in the less cold part of your refrigerator. The paper must be changed every day. This procedure will allow you to save fresh truffles for about 5-6 days for the white one and for 10 days the black one. you can even save the truffles in a can containing rice, but this is not very smart, because you dry the tuber, taking the air off of it and helping the decaying. Another sytem is to deep fry the truffles in the oil, obtaining a sauce you can save in the refrigerator for about a month. Or you can crush it, if black, or slice it, if white, and then mix it with creamy butter and add some salt. Then you shape it as a brick or tube, as you like. Every time you would like to add to a dish the truffle aroma, you can just add a small flake of this valuable truffled butter, resting in the refrigerator. It is better to use the butter within a month from its preparation. truffles in cuisine keep always in mind that: a black truffle must never be grated or crushed in a mortar; it must never be cooked or too warm; never mix truffle and cheese; always use extra-virgin olive oil and salt; use it in dishes which are not alredy very flavoured (Ex. with boiled or grilled lake fish, with boiled or grilled poultry and so on.) 
 Greetings TJ: Well I'm in a pickle.  The memo you sent said we had from 11:30 AM to 10:00PM on 4.19, and from 7 AM to 9 AM on 4.20.

 I'll read it then call you. 
 Looks good, Scott.  One thing:  I admit I'm not a lawyer, so someone needs to show me the precise language in AB 1890 that 1) requires the credit (which, I believe was created by the PUC, not the legislature) to be based on market and 2) requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers.  Mike Day:  Do you concur with Scott's interpretation in AB 1890?  Like your arguments, Scott.  Just want to clarify that we're on solid legal ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief and/or protest.  Best, Jeff    Scott Stoness@EES 04/20/2001 10:46 AM 
 Hey there stranger: By the looks of your attire (very nice), and the pace of you walk the other night, looks like you're back in the working groove.  Hope work is fun and your classes are good.  I'm trying to get used to the "no life" thing again. And you slacked on the happy hour.  Best, Jeff

 You mean I can register in Telebears this Monday from 7 AM to 8 AM?  I have a 7 AM conference call on Monday, but I'll do my darnedest to register then. Thanks for being patient.  Best, Jeff 
 Harry: You clearly did a fantastic job, particularly under the circumstances described by Leslie.  Thanks a million for your help--we really needed it--and you managed to leave with your credibility intact, to boot.  And thanks. too, to Leslie.  The EES piece of the California puzzle is extremely challenging (as you know) and your and Harry's efforts are greatly appreciated.  I can cover the hearings on Monday and Tuesday.  Thanks again.

 Bradford's a former career--PUC Commissioner (I think he's now with Moskovitz' RAP group).  Severin Borenstein's the UC Berkeley professor who's been vocal on wholesale market power and the need for real-time pricing to encourage conservation.  Don't know the other consultant fellow. 
 FYI:  Here's monthly share price date over last five years for:  OAT, KO, PEP, S&P, BRKA, BRKB.  (I included Berkshire in the event we want to say something about Buffet's recent performance.  I've attached another file with a chart that shows Buffet versus S&P for 1, 3 and 5 year performance)  For the OAT, KO, PEP, etc. file, calculated year-on-year performance (excluding dividends).  Also, you'll see highlighted in yellow month-on-month performance for 2001.  But ain't done any chart for that stuff yet.  Thought we'd discuss first.  Best, Jeff 
 Christine:  My apologies.  My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.  Here's where folks came out.  There's some concern about size.  We're supposed to be no larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our "oversized" group.  The other folks in the group--who talked to him originally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.  Folks wondered if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up with.  Sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that I didn't think about when we spoke.  If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group, let me know. Fortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, we have been working with them.  Stephanie and I were asked to meet last week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at length.  It was a very positive meeting.  Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.  And I believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further in D.C.  I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it. I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to contact him.

 No smoking gun in natural-gas cost probe By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau (Published April 23, 2001) It strikes at the heart of an energy crisis that has caused multibillion-dollar losses and could plunge California's economy into a tailspin: Did private companies manipulate markets to get rich off consumers' pain? An Assembly oversight committee spent hours last week grilling officials of El Paso Natural Gas Co. and an affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy, companies that were accused by state regulators of anti-competitive practices that helped send gas prices soaring. Committee Chairman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said the hearing convinced him that El Paso exercised "market power" -- undue influence over supply, demand and prices -- even though no smoking gun surfaced in the testimony. "You have to look at this from a common-sense perspective -- the price spikes were astronomical," Steinberg said. "Could they have occurred in such an extraordinary fashion absent market manipulation? The answer, to me, clearly is no." No wrongdoing has yet been proved, however, and El Paso officials contend they have acted legally and ethically. State regulators have complained to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that El Paso and its affiliates made it difficult for others to use pipeline capacity into California so that El Paso could constrain natural gas supply, increase demand and enrich itself in domino-like fashion. Attorney Harvey Morris of the state Public Utilities Commission told legislators that El Paso improperly sold 40 percent of its California pipeline capacity to an affiliate, which set unrealistically high shipping prices to discourage use by others and drive up the market. "To us, it was pretty obvious what was going on," Morris testified. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate pipelines, has dismissed a PUC allegation that El Paso illegally gave preference to an affiliated company. But the federal agency has scheduled its own hearing into complaints of anti-competitive practices. FERC officials declined to testify at the Assembly hearing. El Paso executives say gas prices have been affected by weather, storage levels and other factors beyond their control, primarily extraordinary demand for natural gas needed by power plants to generate electricity. "We're not withholding capacity -- no one is," Ralph Eads, president of El Paso Merchant Energy, told the oversight panel Thursday. "With these prices, you want to sell every molecule." The controversy is fueled by records showing that natural gas prices at the Southern California border skyrocketed -- far exceeding national averages -- soon after El Paso Merchant assumed control of 1.2 billion cubic feet of daily pipeline capacity from its corporate parent. The El Paso pipeline, one of two key arteries to the state line in Southern California, stretches from Texas through New Mexico to the border town of Topock in Arizona. Prices more than quadrupled at Topock during the one-year period ending in March of this year, records show. Much of that rise stemmed from transportation rather than production costs. By February, prices at Topock had jumped from about $2.59 per million British thermal units to $12.69 per million Btu. Nationally, prices had risen from about $2.61 per million Btu to just $6 per million Btu in that same period, records show. But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, a member of the oversight committee, warned against using such statistics to conclude that El Paso violated any federal pipeline laws or regulations. Making money off a crisis is not necessarily illegal, he said. Market conditions can place private companies in the catbird's seat, allowing them to reap big bucks. Are they obligated -- legally, not morally -- to restrict their profits? "To make the jump from profiting from a shortage to market manipulation is not something that should be done cavalierly," he said. The El Paso case is being watched closely by legislators and consumers. The PUC says that El Paso's market manipulation will cost California gas and electricity customers more than $100 million annually. The Brattle Group consulting firm has placed the figure much higher, estimating that cost increases for electricity customers of Southern California Edison Co. alone totaled about $750 million during the past year. El Paso and its affiliates are involved in selling pipeline space to other natural gas companies, selling gas themselves at the California border and generating alternative sources of electricity whose price is tied to natural gas costs. Shareholders stood to gain handsomely as gas prices shot upward, according to the PUC. El Paso Merchant's earnings before interest and taxes rose from $3 million in 1999 to $563 million in 2000, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report gave no breakdown, however, of profits tied specifically to California. A research firm hired by El Paso, the Lukens Consulting Group, concluded that a complex chain reaction of factors -- not manipulation -- has rocked the state's natural gas industry and affected market dynamics and economics. "Higher electricity prices have caused an increase in demand for gas, which has led to higher prices of gas, which increased demand for pipeline capacity, which caused an increase in the price of pipeline capacity," the group said in a report distributed to legislators. But electricity generators, themselves under investigation in the Legislature for their pricing practices, make the reverse argument: Higher natural gas prices contributed to a rise in their costs for producing electricity. To support claims that El Paso acted unethically, the PUC says the company gave its affiliate an unfair competitive advantage in bidding for pipeline capacity to Southern California by: Structuring the auction to favor awarding the entire bloc to a single bidder. Twenty-four companies submitted bids for portions of the pipe. Only El Paso Merchant sought all of the capacity, offering $38.5 million for a 15-month contract. Failing to disclose to other bidders -- except El Paso Merchant -- that another affiliated company would soon offer discounted rates for use of an interconnection line extending from Topock into Southern California. Testifying before the Assembly committee, El Paso officials scoffed at the suggestion that their auction for pipeline capacity was rigged. The minimum price set for the pipeline space -- $37.5 million -- was a fair one. Auction terms stipulated the capacity would be parceled out if the total of all small bids exceeded the highest "total package" bid, the officials noted. There was nothing unusual about the El Paso affiliate, Mojave, offering a discount to its interconnection line. The line wasn't crucial to bidders. And all companies had the same opportunity to inquire about discount possibilities prior to submitting bids, the officials said. Attorney Peggy Heeg, an El Paso corporate vice president, said FERC strictly regulates relationships among affiliates. But it doesn't ban the types of rate discussions that an unrelated company might have with the corporation, she said. El Paso firms would and could not collude with each other to discourage competition, Heeg said. "(Affiliates) have to operate completely independently -- even if they have the same shareholders," she said. 
 Delainey/Whaley buy off on the approach?    James D Steffes 04/23/2001 07:52 AM 
 I mean on the approach for dealing with Edison re: alternative structures for payment.  When's the drop dead for getting edits to Jennifer's "solution" piece.  You looking at it?  Best, Jeff 
 Not a problem.  My concern is less about you and me---we both have views and are comfortable with the back and forth banter.  I'm actually concerned about Carolyn.  She has worked hard on this, and I think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking a piece of the presentation for Thursday.  I was sensing that she was frustrated.  Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on his plate right now.  My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really expect to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product, given the nature of group dynamic.  I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about, which is a pretty good goal to go after.  Thanks a bunch for the note.

 Appreciate the speedy response.  Actually, it's a "personal" event opposed to a business reason, and though important, I don't think it clears your hurdle.  No problem.  Never hurts to inquire, and I appreciate the consideration.  Best, Jeff    "Jonathan Berk" <berk@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 09/28/2000 04:01 PM Please respond to berk 
 Please include Sue on the call-in info. Thanks.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 04/23/2001 11:31 AM 
 Carolyn:  I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I apologize.  You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point, though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me that, in a group, everyone should have some of their views included---that's what groups and compromises are all about.  After all, it's school.  We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to learn.  Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point, I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much use going to the mat.  Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has been, well, bumpy.  But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the presentation is better off for it.  Best, Jeff 
 In all week (as best I can tell right now).    Joseph Alamo 04/23/2001 11:58 AM 
 u still on call w/Edison?  jeff 
 when u get a chance, can you call and let me know how it went?  thanks. jeff 
 Dude: Two things.  First, in the midst of the craziness on Friday, my black, Northface parka ended up getting put someplace at Sarah's that I wasn't privvy to, and consequently I couldn't find it.  My house keys are in it, so it would great to get it back.  Could you check with Bob/Sarah and see if it's floating around someplace over there?  Muchos gracias.  Second, could you do me a favor?  Could you pay me the full amount for Squaw and then collect from Cameron for what she owes you?  Sorry to be a pain in the ass, but I think logistically, it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to manage it that way (at least from my end).  And to be an even bigger pain.....since my schedule's a disaster with school coming to a close, could you stick the check in the mail?  My address is:  366 Dolores St., #3 SF, 94110  Sorry for all the hassle.  Happy birthday, man.  Best, Jeff 
 Do you have a copy of the order? 
 Here are my comments.  Great job.  I think that the rate design table is a little impenetrable for folks who ain't close to it.  It might benefit from an addition bullet of explanation.  Best, Jeff 
 You have specific questions about the order?  Perhaps the best thing to do is jot down the specific questions, then we can route them to folks in the know (which is likely to be more than one person).  That make any sense? 
 FYI.  Her take on the Senate going after the creditors' dedicated rate component as the first (and most important) change is on target in my view. Best, Jeff    Kristin Walsh/ENRON@enronXgate 04/23/2001 02:07 PM 
 FYI.  The weekend of the 9th/10th is definitely out for me.  I'm sorry, honey. 
 FYI.  From our folks in Sacramento:  AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.  It's not an emergency bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and summer. AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be "regulated."  Also no an emergency bill. AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.  Best, Jeff 
 My apologies for getting the sponsor incorrect.  I'll notify folks.  We'll need to discuss tomorrow on the call what position, if any, we (Enron) takes vis-a-vis New Power's attempts to get default provider.  Thanks very much for the info.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies.  The competitive default provider bill is actually being sponsored by our brave compatriots at The New Power Company. Best, Jeff 
 Carolyn:  If you'd planned on making a chart similar to the one that you did previously, the symbols are STISPBEVA for the S&P 500 beverage index and ?STISPFOOD for the S&P 500 food index.  Best, Jeff    "Guinney, Mark" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 04/23/2001 12:17 PM 
 You available to talk today? 
 I'll be going to everything, whether it makes sense or not, and spending a lot of money. 
 Thanks, man.  Up until the trauma and the drama (the genesis of which remains a mystery), I had a great time.  Please thank Sarah and Bob---great food, great company, etc.  Tell them sorry for leaving all my stuff lying around. Thanks for sending a single check.  $736 is the amount.  Talk to you soon.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/23/2001 04:23 PM 
 My apologies.  It ain't proofed.  Let me know if this is what you're looking for.  Best, Jeff 
 you know, i'd have to be in a store and have the opportunity to look at a bunch of styles in order to choose a pair.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 09/28/2000 03:50 PM 
 While I, too, am frustrated at how things turned out, I'm glad your content overall with the course.  Definitely one of the best--if not THE best--classes I've taken.  I really think that we need to get together tomorrow nite to finalize, but I don't feel like pushing it too much.  Your thoughts?  Best, Jeff    "Vavrek, Carolyn (US - San Francisco)" <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 04/23/2001 07:08 PM 
 Hi. Is there a reason I keep getting this stuff from these guys.  Sincerely, Clueless 
 I'm available. 
 Nice job.  You take a self-promotion course over the weekend?    Susan J Mara 04/24/2001 10:33 AM 
 I love you very much and of course want to be together, but some things need to be worked out because there's too much depression and pain associated with those incidents.  They have to stop.  I have never been embarrassed to be with you.  I'm as proud as can be.  I think that's something coming from within you that you need to work on, but I'm willing to help.  I don't want to end anything, but we need to fix it, or we'll have have to end it.  I love you and miss you.    Prentice Sellers <psellers@pacbell.net> 04/24/2001 10:56 AM 
 FYI.  Bob Williams should be touching base with you; or it would be useful for you to touch base with him.  Edison appears to be staking out it's negotiating position with us through their filing.  In short, they "recalculate" the PX credit post-Jan. 19 (when DWR took over procurement).  That recalculation turns our $125 MM dollar PX credit claim into $63MM.  So we're pretty far apart.  We agreed at this point to oppose the filing and say:  1) through the end of the rate freeze, or end of 3.31.02, the status quo remains--"PX credit" based on market price (Dow Jones index). 2) however, if you want to go "utility purchase" price as the basis for the credit, then it must be the utility's full cost of power (retained gen+QFs+DWR+ISO real time). 3) negative credit during the transition can still occur. 3) Edison's proposal should be rejected.  Best, Jeff 
 The "big" meetings, which happen about every quarter, are de rigeur.  The summer "big" meeting is an absolute must (and generally very fun).  I'll be there.  Hope you're there, too.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  Did you hear from Sue Mara re: how the California ISO works? 
 Plz look up decision no. 01-04-006 on the commission's website.  it has to do with interruptible and curtailment issues and rotating outages, i.e., blackouts.  Thanks a million, Jeff 
 Carpenter is saying that prices went up due to manipulation, pure and simple, we're saying that it's the reasons listed on the 1 1/2 pager that I sent. Give a call and we can discuss further.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Could you email me the final version of the stipulation.  Thanks a lot.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 FYI.  Might be useful to have the bill forwarded to the larger group, in addition to Gavin. Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Please also fax copies to Jim and Rick in Houston at 713.646.8160.  Best, Jeff    MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 04/24/2001 04:31 PM 
 The interim settlement never got voted out.  Therefore it ain't official, so there's no requirement yet to refile anything.  (Welcome to California.)  In fact, folks are still trying to get the Commission to reject the IS and approve the one that we worked on (though the chances of that are not huge, at this point).  Give a holler if there's anything else.  Best, Jeff    Stephanie Miller 04/24/2001 02:00 PM 
 Greetings all: I'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to all this evening.  I have a conference call at 7 am tomorrow.  Apologies. But I think it's very important that we get together one last time to ensure that we're all on the same page, that folks understand clearly what slides they're responsible for presenting, etc.  What about lunch tomorrow (we're all in the city), or at 5 PM (before the ball game)?  Lemme know.  Best, Jeff    "Guinney, Mark" <Mark_Guinney@watsonwyatt.com> 04/24/2001 09:51 AM 
 Gang:  I'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t. siting reform.  One of our key messages in California and nationally is that price spikes are due in no small part to outmoded, arcane siting rules and a shortage of power as a result.  Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps, investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back de-regulation, to name a few.  Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this session is a fairly high priority?  I'm not sure what the answer is, but it struck me as I was pretty-ing up the document and I thought I'd put it out there for reaction.  Best, Jeff 
 could you send my the slides that you put together on Saturday?  Muchas Gracias.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Ms Hunter: I'll be participating via conference call.  Best, Jeff

 Actually, could you call me on my cell phone @ 415.505.6633?  Best, Jeff 
 I cleaned this up a little bit.  Best, Jeff 
 merci. 
 Can't wait to meet the little bundle of joy. 
 Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their message was simple (and simplistic):  El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to "obscene" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.  Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics.  Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling.  Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.  Best, Jeff 
 Any of those days work EXCEPT the 22nd.    Prentice Sellers <psellers@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 09/28/2000 03:19 PM

 Harry:  Per my voicemail.  Let's talk first thing in the AM to discuss.  Best, Jeff    JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 04/24/2001 07:36 PM 
 Here's the ratio analysis.  Let me know if you'd like me to put it into a text table for the presentation.  Best, Jeff 
 It was only a draft.  The commission has to vote it out for it to become effective.  They've delayed doing that.  Therefore it's status quo on the SoCalGas system.    Stephanie Miller/ENRON@enronXgate 04/25/2001 08:58 AM 
 Apologies.  My schedule's been difficult to control.  I am in fact in the office this morning, so you can call me here at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff    Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate 04/25/2001 08:29 AM 
 This is a very good synopsis of the gas crimes trials in California.  Pleas= e=20 note comments of Assembly Republican John Campbell---perhaps the sole brigh= t=20 spot in the California Legislature...  Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation  Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20 California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the= =20 state=01,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane= d=20 heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility= =20 Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.  But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu= ral=20 Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i= t=20 recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.  As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP= UC=20 are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde= r=20 prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against = El=20 Paso is The Brattle Group=01,s study of the California market.  Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman= =20 of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20 Group=01,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not= =20 caused by normal market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during= =20 which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in= =20 the California market.  El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor= t=20 presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence= =20 of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up.  Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa= so=20 to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20 concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the= =20 main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio.  Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,= =20 said he "didn=01,t see any smoking gun" in either report.  "We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20 Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20 legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell=20 said. "I believe FERC is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that=01,s the= =20 appropriate place."  Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to= =20 give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It=01,s being pushed=20 basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by=20 pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said.  The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: "There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission."  Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own.  The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily= =20 litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20 participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out= =20 The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20 major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.  Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the= =20 requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20 process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting= =20 access to evidence (GD 4/23).  Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their= =20 case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a= =20 large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20 addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th= e=20 California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation.  The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a= =20 hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv= e=20 up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place= =20 this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.) NH 
 Yes, I can do the call. 
 Wanted to make sure u knew:  S&P downgraded CA rating--two notches--from AA to A+.  Only Louisiana is lower.  AND S&P kept CA on cred. watch--could go lower.  It's slipping thru Davis' fingers.  Jeff 
 Also, talked to M. Day.  those one-pagers should be coming in the next hour. jeff

 No thanks necessary.  My pleasure.  Hope that it helped.  What was the gist of his comments regarding the gas side?  Best, Jeff    Rob Bradley 04/25/2001 03:43 PM 
 If Ken Lay's going to be in Sac, seems that he should meet with John Burton. You agree?  Jeff 
 You're a saint(esse). 
 Yes.    Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate 04/25/2001 04:10 PM 
 i wouldn't worry about that....    Leslie Lawner 04/25/2001 04:24 PM

 If Ken Lay's going to Sac to have meetings, seems that he should meet w/Burton.  You agree?  Thx, Jeff 
 Rosalee: Thanks very much for helping arrange the meetings.  Here is the list thus far.  There may be additions.  I've also suggested dates for the meetings.  May 3rd in Sacramento (after the meeting with David Freeman):  Governor Davis (he spends a lot of time in Los Angeles and you may find that he prefers to meet there). House Speaker Robert Hertzberg House Republican member John Campbell (Republican's point person on energy issues) House Minority Leader David Cox Senate Majority Leader John Burton Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte  May 4th--Morning, in Los Angeles John Bryson, CEO Edison International Governor Davis (unless the meeting occurs on the 3rd in Sacramento)  May 4th--Afternoon, in San Francisco Bob Glynn, CEO PG&E  Joseph Alamo from our office will provide you with the phone numbers for John Campbell, David Cox, John Burton, and Jim Brulte.  I assume that your office has the numbers for John Bryson and Bob Glynn.  If you do not have the numbers, let me know and I will get them for you.  Thanks again for your help.  Best, Jeff     Rosalee Fleming 04/25/2001 03:09 PM 
 call when you're ready to start up again. jeff 
 make sense to do this if sanders can't make it? jeff 
 Got your message.  Thanks. I think that 2 hours is the most we'll want to take with Freeman.  Might be shorter, but I can't imagine that it would go any longer.  Best, Jeff 
 note from linda sez he can't make it.  jeff 
 You got it. 
 Thanks. jeff 
 I think this captures it.  I've also attached the "Posture" document Sue wrote up.  While Paul takes a first crack at the cover memo, please review both documents and see if there are any changes that either needs.  Best, Jeff 
 Breathitt's hanging tough, siding w/Hebert, standing for markets.  Jeff 
 sounds like cap on stages 1-3 based on least efficient, marginal unit.  jeff 
 "Must-sell" provision for "participating" generators in real-time markets. Jeff 
 Demand-side bidding in real-time markets to pay for curtailment.  "Study" WSCC to see if "mitigation" needed throughout the West.  jeff 
 Let's get back together first thing in the AM to finish the "solutions" doc. I've done some more editing.  Off now to school stuff.  Jeff 
 Here are my brief edits to the presentation--added a couple of bullets to the Quaker slide and tightened up the deal summary slide.  Also attaching a word doc of additional info for everyone for use during the presentation and Q&A. Also attached is the deal comps table.  Best, Jeff 
 hey buddie.  our stock's up (so FERC order ain't so bad?).  w/the lay thing, Vickie's memo's gotta wait.  You concur.  best,jeff 
 See my note and Christine's response.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Jimmie, apparently she's had a crush on you ever since she heard you say, "Cash-sucking machine." 
 thanks. jeff 
 poor thing.  what else is there after dual 790s?    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 04/26/2001 10:29 AM 
 looking at it right now. 
 One minor edit---it's the PX, not the ISO, that's taken itself into voluntary bankruptcy.  See redline version attached.  Only other comment:  I'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered into transactions with the PX (in the same way that I don't think that folks enter into transactions with NYMEX).  (See opening line of last paragraph.)  We have exposure to thePX based on our commercial activity that took place through the PX, and that exposure depends on how the PX /FERC decide particular issues.  In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and exposure to the PX based on transactions that we entered into with other counter parties via the PX market mechanism.  That said, seems to me that, for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise the flag. Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders.  Hope this helps.  Best, Jeff 
 I thought that you're going to be at pacbell park all weekend. 
 10,000 creditors seek PG&E billions Confidential list reveals each vendor's claim David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, April 26, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/26/M N229624.DTL The plight of PG&E's vast array of business partners, many of which are owed millions of dollars, is made painfully clear in a confidential list of creditors now being compiled for the utility's bankruptcy proceedings. A copy of the list, obtained by The Chronicle, illustrates the impact of the third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on PG&E's thousands of vendors. This also is the first time the monetary value is being revealed for each Pacific Gas and Electric Co. contract. "It's going to be a cat fight," said Cathy Moran, a Mountain View bankruptcy attorney. "They'll be fighting over a limited pot of money, and each party will be seeking preferential treatment." The $9 billion owed by the utility to its more than 10,000 creditors constitutes the largest-ever bankruptcy involving a utility. The need to keep California's lights on adds a virtually unprecedented level of complexity to the proceedings. Companies on the creditor list run the gamut from huge to tiny. IBM Corp. and Pacific Bell are joined by the likes of Pete's Auto Body Shop in Merced and Sponges Car Wash in San Ramon. "We provide gas and electricity to 13 million people," said Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman. "Behind all the poles and wires are thousands of employees and the thousands of vendors who support them." He said every department at the utility had spent weeks pulling together information for the creditor list, to be submitted to Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali by mid-May. 'REPAY ALL OUR CREDITORS' "We've had to look at all the contracts we have with companies and individuals," Low said. "It is our intention to repay all our creditors." Whether the various creditors receive all, some or none of the cash owed them will be determined once a reorganization plan is worked out, perhaps years down the road. The Bankruptcy Court will contact all PG&E creditors and invite them to submit what is known as a "proof of claim" -- evidence that the creditor indeed is owed money. This is a matter taken very seriously by San Martin's Allwaste Transportation, a chemical disposal firm, which relies on PG&E for about a quarter of its total revenues. As it happened, an Allwaste technician was pumping hazardous waste out of PG&E's Humboldt Bay power plant near Eureka at the exact same time that the utility was filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. Payment for that service, as with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of other jobs, is now in limbo as a result of PG&E's bankruptcy. 'THEY STUCK WITH US' "PG&E is very important to us," said Lee Soares, Allwaste's operations manager. "This is definitely a hit." He added, however, that his company would stand behind the utility. "They stuck with us when we went bankrupt," Soares acknowledged. Many of PG&E's creditors reflect the utility's core operations. For example, the list contains numerous affiliates involved with power poles, trimming trees around electricity lines or laying pipes for natural gas transmission. Meanwhile, other creditors speak to the nuts and bolts of running a business with 21,500 workers and far-reaching activities. If a PG&E truck is involved in a fender-bender in the East Bay, it might be taken to The Masters body shop in Hayward, which has a contract with the utility valued at $28,800. "We do a lot of work for them," said co-owner Jan Masters. "We'd miss the account if they stopped coming." That hasn't happened yet. Masters said PG&E had continued bringing its vehicles to her two-person shop since the bankruptcy filing. So far, the utility has paid its bills promptly. "They don't get the vehicle back if we don't get paid," Masters noted. One of the most prominent creditors on PG&E's list is Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. The utility's $13 million contract makes it Hertz's single biggest corporate client in the Bay Area and one of its largest in the nation. 500 PAYMENTS DUE HERTZ According to the creditor list, PG&E has nearly 500 payments for various equipment and vehicle rentals outstanding with Hertz. The individual transactions range in value from as much as $97,539 to as little as $1. "We provide a lot of equipment for them, heavy construction equipment to build things," said Diana Kirby, who handles the PG&E account at Hertz's Rohnert Park headquarters. "Basically, they couldn't afford to purchase all the items they rent from us. "Their filing for bankruptcy will have a large impact on us," she added. "But we'll weather the storm. What else can we do?" That's the dilemma facing all PG&E creditors, large and small. A select committee of the utility's largest creditors will seek to represent other vendors during the bankruptcy proceedings. In typical Chapter 11 cases, this arrangement tends to work smoothly for all concerned. But in a case as sprawling and complicated as PG&E's reorganization, there is a possibility that the interests of smaller creditors can get lost in the shuffle. The bankruptcy judge could seek to simplify things by addressing the claims of PG&E's smaller creditors first, thus reducing the size of the playing field when the big guys begin duking it out. "This case is going to write its own rules," predicted Moran, the bankruptcy lawyer. "You've got a very large number of dollars and the public interest involved." STRANGE BEDFELLOWS You also have a situation in which PG&E's financial demise has made bedfellows of companies and individuals that might otherwise have never crossed paths. Xerox Corp. now stands arm-in-arm with Hayward's A-1 Septic Tank Service. Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a comrade of Modesto's Jack Frost Ice Service. Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto has more than 40 claims outstanding for computer services ranging in value from $22 to $72,583. But the company already is looking ahead to new deals. "PG&E has been a good customer," said Randy Lane, an H P spokesman. "We would expect that, after the proceedings are done, they'll continue to be a good customer." On the other hand, freelance photographer Steve Castillo in Menlo Park has a contract with PG&E valued at $25,000 to shoot pictures for the utility's in- house newsletter. That was when times were good. "I assume I'm not going to get any more calls from them," Castillo said.

 Greetings folks: Just checking in to see how we're doing and if folks got the files that I sent last night.  Should we try to meet at 5:30 to do a final run through?  I think that we might be the very first presentation (yikes).  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Ms Guerrero:  I'd suggest that we set up the briefing with Ken for Tuesday afternoon, given that we've got a lot to do between now and then.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks a bunch for all the work you've done on this bloody thing.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  As you recall, based on the meeting that I attended at SVMG with Karen Denne and Jeff Skilling, they put me on their internal distribution list (though I'm not sure that they realize it).  Here's the latest from Carl Guardino, the groups Exec Dir, and Davis appointee to the ISO.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the note.  I'm going to pass it along to the others.  Will get back to you very soon.  Remember that there's no team case due on Monday because class is cancelled and everything got pushed back.  But the first individual case has to be done by Tuesday.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Report by the business community of the impact of blackouts on the Cal economy.  Getting a considerable amount of play here.  Best, Jeff  P.S.  Karen, could you forward to our buddies at Marathon?  Thanks very much. 
 o mah gawd, you're kidding, right?    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/26/2001 01:03 PM 
 Jim: Am doing my final edits to solutions.  Know Jen and Robert are still working, but I'm continuing through.  Will email to you within hour.  Then turning to SCE MOU.  Best, Jeff 
 electronically tagged prior to departure, though, I'm sure.  Hey, did you sent the check yet?  (signed, scrooge)    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/26/2001 01:25 PM 
 ain't got anything yet.  you get the stuff that i sent last nite? 
 Yeah, gave the disc to Prentice.  Also (and don't ask me how this happened, cuz I couldn't tell ya), Cameron put the battery to her camera (I think?) in my shirt pocket.  I gave that to Prentice last night, too.  So she's got both of them.  Thanks a million (or at least $736) for the check.  Best, Jeff 
 call me on my cell phone (415.505.6633) when you get a chance.  thx, jeff 
 Looks good to me.  See you at 5:30 at Mr. Beans.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds great.  Could you touch base with Paul and coordinate?  Muchas gracias.  Best, Jeff 
 CEO of Edison.    Susan M Landwehr 04/26/2001 03:37 PM 
 Hi Scott:  Thanks for the note.  Hope things are well.  I'd like to call the El Paso person if that works for you.  Yep, moratorium's still in place (at least to build your own---you can always get someone who previously received authority to do it for you).  I'll keep you posted.  Best, Jeff    Scott_Pleus@enron.net 09/28/2000 11:17 AM 
 Buddie:  Solutions doc is in your in-box.  I'm moving on to SCE MOU analysis.  Call if need anything. Best, Jeff 
 You gotta go.    Susan Scott/ENRON@enronXgate 04/26/2001 03:49 PM 
 Don't have my car here.  Planned on taking BART, but if possible, might be useful to carpool--give us additional time to discuss the presentation.  I'm game.  Best, Jeff    "Sama, Anil" <anil.sama@intel.com> 04/26/2001 04:07 PM 
 yes, you ain't seen it? 
 faxed at noon california time. 
 Greetings Rosie:  As you confirm meetings with Mr. Lay next week, could you drop a line to Maureen, Janel and me?  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 let me see what i can do.    Lisa Yoho 04/26/2001 04:49 PM 
 I think that there's something wrong with your email.. I'll be at market and beale.  best, jeff 
 what time you picking up? 
 Thanks.  If you'd like to have a conversation that doesn't include the whole gang on the conference call about the Brattle Group stuff, give me a call and we can have a calmer, more detailed discussion without all the noise.  Best, Jeff 
 OK, I'm a mindless idiot.  And an embarrassed one at that.  To which offer are you referring?  Also, learned that PG&E's big "want" in the Son of Gas Accord is a few hundred million to build more Tx and Local Tx.  Sounds like this could have an IMMENSE negative impact on TW.  You better get your fanny out here, like pronto.  I sense death and destruction. 
 thank you.  nice job on the call today. 
 FYI.  This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group= =20 that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t= he=20 legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California= =20 Border.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20 presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El= =20 Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20 presentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've= =20 seen in the press.  Best, Jeff ***************************************************************************= *** **************************************************** Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation  Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20 California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the= =20 state=01,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane= d=20 heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility= =20 Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.  But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu= ral=20 Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i= t=20 recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.  As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP= UC=20 are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde= r=20 prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against = El=20 Paso is The Brattle Group=01,s study of the California market.  Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman= =20 of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20 Group=01,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not= =20 caused by normal market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during= =20 which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in= =20 the California market.  El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor= t=20 presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence= =20 of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up.  Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa= so=20 to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20 concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the= =20 main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio.  Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,= =20 said he "didn=01,t see any smoking gun" in either report.  "We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20 Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20 legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell=20 said. "I believe FERC is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that=01,s the= =20 appropriate place."  Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to= =20 give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It=01,s being pushed=20 basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by=20 pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said.  The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: "There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission."  Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own.  The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily= =20 litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20 participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out= =20 The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20 major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.  Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the= =20 requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20 process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting= =20 access to evidence (GD 4/23).  Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their= =20 case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a= =20 large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20 addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th= e=20 California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation.  The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a= =20 hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv= e=20 up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place= =20 this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.) NH 
 Just for the record, I just reviewed my "Jeff's Goals for 2001" that Paul and I worked up, and "doing time for the company" didn't make the list this year.  Paul, I double-checked and "dating Loretta Lynch" is, likewise, not on the list.  Best, Jeff 
 There a  call-in number for this? 
 I'll make sure that you're on this distribution list (you're not currently = on=20 it, right?).  Best, Jeff

 Thanks to all.  Ended up working out pretty well.  We may have been the only folks thus far that finished within 20 minutes (or 45 minutes, it seems, for that matter).  Best, Jeff 
 you still ain't got it?  I sent it to you twice yesterday.  You think we have an email problem?  Best, Jeff 
 thank you 
 The Bryson meeting will likely be Steve and Ken, or me and Steve and Ken---at least that's the poop that I've received thus far.  Best, Jeff 
 Give me a call.  I'm thinking that from your note, the CA meetings are getting in your way.  I was hoping that KL could meet with Bryson on the 4th, but looks like they already scheduled.  I just want to make sure that Rosie doesn't get all crossed up with many of us sending her stuff.  Let's talk and maybe I can get the Bryson meeting rearranged.  Your pal, Jeff 
 Hey buddy: I'm going to have to bail on the solutions doc at this point so that I can focus on the backgrounder, the MOU and the buy down.  Also, I'll be in Houston on Monday. Best, Jeff 
 you get a chance to see the work that I did on the document and sent you yesterday? 
 Hi: I'm going to call you in a bit--I'm on a conference call right now.  We need to coordinate just a wee bit.  Landwehr's all over Rosie, and we're getting mixed up between her RGA meetings and the CA meetings. I talked to her a little this AM and expressed a concern that we not get poor Rosie all wrapped around an axle and confused.  We may have several points of contact here for various issues.  No big deal, but I want to make sure things don't get more complicated than they need to be.  I'll forward you a note from Sue to Rosie (and me) that you weren't on.  Also want to talk about your voicemail last night--i.e., I may need to travel with KL, which is fine by me if that's necessary.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  We need to reign Sue in just a teensy bit. 
 oh man.  I sent to you yesterday---the solutions piece.  did a bunch of work on it.  here it is. 
 chk email for the stuff i did yesterday on solutions doc.  lots of edits and did consistent formatting.  jeff 
 on interminable conference calls.  i'll call les.  best, jeff 
 Jim: Here's the DG stuff from the Hertzberg letter ***************************************************************************= 8  Key Barriers to the Development of Distributed Generation and Proposals to= =20 Remove the Barriers  Barrier:  Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges  Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a step in= =20 the right direction, but don=01,t go nearly far enough.  Utility stand-by= =20 charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopol= y=20 position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both.  They must be=20 eliminated for all distributed generation applications.  There is no reason= =20 to limit the elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are= =20 less than 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it= =20 takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand= =20 and reduce the risk of black outs this summer.=20  The provisions of SB27X eliminating stand-by charges were stripped from the= =20 bill.  This will likely thwart any attempts to encourage the near-term=20 development of distributed generation and reduce the severe supply-demand= =20 imbalance in California.  The language eliminating stand-by charges should be re-inserted into SB27X= =20 and modified to remove all caps on plant size.=20 =20 Barrier: Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities= =20 with investor-owned and municipal utilities  Solution:  =20 The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in th= e=20 right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection= =20 studies within 7 days.

               PR01: 174 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 04/26/2001  GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO PROVIDE POWER TO CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis has signed three executive orders to increase stabilization, conservation and generation of power in California. Executive Order D-34-01 Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago. Executive Order D-34-01 will speed up implementation of the measures. Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this summer. With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding. The programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included: Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA); Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters; Municipal Program; and Cool Roofs/Building Materials Executive Order D-33-01 Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation rebate of the "20/20" program to the customers in the territory serviced by the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The program is designed to help the state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who significantly conserve energy. In addition, it could save the state up to $1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state must buy during expensive summer peak periods. Executive Order D-32-01 In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation of the power plant construction incentive program. Incentives will include: $5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line by July 1, 2001; $4,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,000 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between July 2, 2001 and August 1, 2001; and $3,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $1,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between August 2, 2001 and August 31, 2001.

 you ever get the Brattle prez?  jeff 
 are u serious?  jeff    7409949@skytel.com 04/27/2001 02:06 PM 
 let me no when you hear from SK re: accompany lay, so i can re-arrange schedule if necessary.  thx,jeff (want to see if you really wear pager :)) 
 u ah dead. 
 I'm assuming that you're in the loop on this decision making?  Best, Jeff    Janel Guerrero 04/27/2001 02:39 PM 
 the offer's still good...    Susan Scott 09/29/2000 09:20 AM 
 i got an email bounced back from your address.  let me know if you get this one. 
 Greetings:  On the call between Ken Lay and Bob Hertzberg, Hertzberb asked us to resend any thoughts (and any more detail) we have on demand buy-downs.  I've combined our on-line auction proposal with the "federal" solution recently worked up for the Cheney meetings (I tailored it for California consumption).  Hertzberg wanted it today in advance of meetings that he's having in Washington next week.  Scott Governor will deliver this to Hertzberg's office today.  Sorry for quick turn around, but if folks have comments, could you send them to me pronto so that Scott can deliver to Hertzberg's office before COB?  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 I have cleared my calendar, so any time in the morning works for me.  Best, Jeff    Janel Guerrero 04/27/2001 04:30 PM 
 Here's the final that Scott Governar will deliver to Hertzberg today.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  What's "the report."  Best, Jeff 
 u need to participate by phone if you can.  Best, Jeff 
 Rob had Robert Michaels give me a ring re: potential panelist at the field hearing.  Be happy to pitch him to Ms Van Way.  Thoughts? 
 This mean we'll be toning down our criticism of the utility's behavior in the California market in our filings at FERC regarding the price spike investigation?    Mary Hain@ECT 09/28/2000 05:38 PM 
 Thanks very much.  I think, rather than Crawford, you might be referring to David Cox, Republican leader of the California Assembly?  Really can't thank you enough for you help on this.  Have a great weekend.  Best, Jeff    Rosalee Fleming 04/27/2001 07:25 PM 
 FYI.  given this info, there's a chance that i might try to get in.  how's the sign-u look at this point?  Best, Jeff 
 Dudes: I'm am officially responsible for the case and of course appreciate all Dylan's (and everyone else's) efforts.  Here's my game plan.  I'm going to spend the day working on it---adding to what's already been passed around. Dylan, I'll look at the numbers and perhaps send you (and others) thoughts regarding the crunching, since you've already starting crunching.  I'll try to do as much of the write-up (building on what others have done) and send around by COB today.  Once everyone's had a chance to comment, etc. I'll finalize tomorrow night.  I have to fly to Houston at the crack of dawn on Monday and therefore can't go to class, so I'm hoping that someone else can turn it in.  Let me know if this works for folks.  Best, Jeff    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 04/28/2001 01:02 AM 
 Thanks.  If you need to talk just page me at 888.916.7184.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the gov's analysis of the MOU.  Have a good weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 Left you a voicemail last nite.  I get on the plane Houston at 6:30 AM PDT, so you'll have to do it solo.  I'll get to the office around 130-200.  I'll come to your office and you can fill me in on how it went.  Best, Jeff 
 OK Gang:  Well, I=01,ve been crunching numbers all day, and haven=01,t yet gotten to = the=20 writing.  I've attached Dylan's original responses for reference.  Figure= =20 it'll be a memo from Time's CEO to the Time Board.  I=01,ve leaving now for Mendocino, but will be back early tomorrow to finis= h=20 this up.  Please check out the spreadsheet.

That doesn=01,t jive.  Are they saying that, absent synergies, the= =20 combined Time/Warner is worth the enterprise value of Time at 189-212 plus= =20 the enterprise value of Warner at $63-71 (again, the analysts valuation)? = =20 That just seems ridiculous, give where they=01,re trading.  Anyway, here=01,s where my analysis is heading----tell me if I=01,m smoking= crack.  The deal isn=01,t really $175 per share.  It=01,s $175 LESS the taxes that = will=20 have to paid (since it=01,s a purchase deal) PLUS the value of the tax shie= ld=20 created by the net increase of $8.9B in new debt that Paramount will take= =20 on.  Does this seem right?  Could folks look at my spreadsheet?

In any case, I=01,ll be back around Noon tomorrow and will crank the puppy = out.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks to all for your comments.  I've tried to weave together the various (and insightful) comments I received from folks with the great stuff that Dylan put together initially and the stuff that I whipped up. They're attached.  Please proof the thing---I fear that there's a typo, or two. Since I'm off to beatiful Houston at the crack of dawn, Dylan has graciously agreed to take any further comments, integrate them,  and print the final thing out to turn in at class tomorrow.  Thanks a million, Dylan.  You folks should discuss whether you want to include the Excel exhibits as I've included them in the memo---no pride of ownership, so don't be timid.  Dylan, they are formatted for printing, so all you should have to do is print away. See you all soon.  Best, Jeff 
 I'd vote to let Hap do it. 
 Ms Fleming: No apologies necessary.  Anybody would be confused with what we've thrown at you.  Just to be sure, it's David Cox (new Republican leader in the Assembly) and John Campbell (Republican Assemblyman).  Can't thank you enough for you help.  Hope you had a nice weekend.  Jeff 
 Thanks, Lee.  Is there a firmed-up agenda yet?  If so, could you forward to me? 
 Yes (sort of).  I'm in Houston.  Up on 47.  What's up? 
 Hey!  I'm in Houston.  You'll have my backgrounder tomorrow.  (The way things are going today, I'll be working on it till the wee hours tonite.)  Best, Jeff 
 You can reach me on my pager at 888.916.7184, and during the day, Ginger and Maureen can get a hold of me as well.  All the offices in the Capitol are in the same building--so it's possible to get from one to other in about 5 minutes.  If there's anything else, don't hesitate to contact me.  Best, Jeff 
 Yep.    James D Steffes 04/30/2001 09:05 PM 
 So was his angle, the shareholders should take the $175 and run?    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 05/01/2001 11:39 AM 
 there was a strong case for that. only thing preventing was the internal DCF of the time-warner deal being 183-212 (or something)---so why didn't the market put that value on it?  I went with what i thought the flow of the group was, but it was a tough row to hoe.  where were you on it? 
 Hi Anita: Thanks again for you help with the questions I had about the deals going on California.  I'd like to follow-up with you and Steve, particularly regarding the "not a telecom" aspect of the deal.  These deals are going to accelerate--very confidentially, they are directly linked to getting the universe connected to Enron On-line, our very successful B2B website.  I'd like to discuss with you two as soon as possible.  Could you let me know when a convenient time is?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Subject: LADWP, BC Hydro, Bonneville Accused of Gouging California  Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation.  By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers  ????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall, according to public and confidential records. ?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into darkness and economic chaos. ?????But they are just part of the equation. ?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized profits in the volatile spot market. ?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's BC Hydro in British Columbia. ?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas & Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. ?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in the spot, or "real-time," market from May to November. The study accounted for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. ?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. ?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show. ?????"They were the most aggressive bidders," said Anjali Sheffrin, author of the coded study. ?????"They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in," said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. ?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged inflated earnings. ?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the state's troubles. ?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium. ?????"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time," said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. "We helped keep the lights on in California." ?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a "rainy day" account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. ?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market, where emergency purchases are made. ?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them from falling. ?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy market. ?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. "The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions." ?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings "outrageous," insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. ?????"These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state," Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state. ?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce. ?????"We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%," he said. "It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats." ?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never took it personally. "If you're innocent," he said, "you don't look at the criminal file." ?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. ?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits. ?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon recovery program. ?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. ?????"From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we operated precisely within the terms of their rules," Oliver said. ?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act responsibly, has bailed out. ?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, the highest. ?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers offering power received the highest price paid in any hour. ?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to sell at a single-digit price. ?????"They weren't the culprits," said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. "Someone else drove that up." ?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. ?????"We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw," he said. ?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because the overall prices are still excessive. ?????"We're saying the patient is sick," Sheffrin said of California's electricity market. "It needs help [and] may die." ?????

 As of right now, I'm available, but with the crisis in California, I might be called away.  At this point, though, I'm clear and will plan on meeting.  My apologies for the uncertainty.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the note.  We'll need to to discuss this a bit further, since it could be a very sensitive issue for us (e.g., "Enron's answer to the electricity crisis in municipalization).  If spun right, could provide an interesting opportunity, however.  Best, Jeff    Robert Davis/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange 05/04/2001 04:08 PM

 You're welcome, but no need for thanks.  I was just telling it like it is. You do a great job for us, and we appreciate it a lot.  I'm going to be up on there on Monday.  I'm going to need for you to get me up to speed a little bit on the gas bills.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 decided i ought to ask around first..... 
 Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue Book).  He was following up from the meeting this morning with Bob Glynn.  He was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to Glynn at this morning's meeting.  He was particularly positive about the core/noncore proposal.  He asked to meet to discuss it further.  I have an appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.  He offered--as a board member of the California Chamber of Commerce--to help bring the Chamber along, and he also said that he can help with the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Ass. I'll report back after the meeting.  And may have already mentioned that I have a meeting scheduled in Sacramento Monday with the CEO of the Chamber and the President of CMA.  Will report back on the meetings.  Have a good weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi folks: Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.  Worse, some nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time) deleted my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed up)---year's worth of work and school gone, kaputt.  Anyway, if there's any chance that someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me, I would be greatly indebted.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and see you on Monday.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings Laura and Marybeth:  Laura: If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour briefing you on the energy situation.  I apologize for the brevity of this note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.  In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of center).  The deal would be bi-partisan.  If successful, the deal would:  Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right price signals for efficiency, but fall short of "shock therapy." Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates. Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the solution Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate changes. Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market. NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal). Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers. Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc.  Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of "wise persons" to help get the deal done.  L. Summers is willing; others are being considered.  Your name has come up.  But that issue can be addressed later. The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events, which are breaking quickly.  Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.  Congratulations on Haas' #7 ranking in US News and World Report.  Best, Jeff  Office 415.782.7822 Pager 888.916.7184 Home 415.621.8317 Cell 415.505.6633

 Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up doing more work on my property.

 Greetings:  Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California Chamber of Commerce.  Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.  Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read "grow up") and do a comprehensive deal.  Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.  We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support and pitch:  1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve this now, and 2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've described.  They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly didn't reject the idea.  Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm serious.  Are you referring to the proposal that no one knows about that everyone knows about?  We going to celebrate?    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/08/2001 06:27 PM 
 Marybeth:  My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter returning to Houston.

 FYI. Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).  This is the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.  Will check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes were made.  Best, Jeff 
 Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea (lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:  They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut. McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore ("why should it be mandatory to go the market?"), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for core/noncore has a lot of merit. Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) should pay for DWR's "past" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates the core's "net short" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would not have to pay for any of DWR's "going forward costs" (since core gets them, in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation) I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects would be and would share it with them when we're done. While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do. They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the Legislature. Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to CMA. Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved. 
 My apologies.  I took a vacation that I was in much need of, and as you know, it's more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the day-to-day mess.  And I came back to utter chaos.  Regarding my homework assignment, I checked my records and, lo and behold, I am completely vested.  That said, I also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to make leaving a compelling proposition.  Of course, it goes without saying that working with you is about as compelling as it gets, but when I stack up the other pieces of the puzzle, they seem somewhat less compelling than the opportunity to work with you.  It is so enticing.  But it is with extreme regret that I am inclined to decline your gracious offer.  Would be happy to discuss it further, and you know without me saying that I am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative.  Give a holler when you find a minute.  Best, Jeff

 Marybeth:  I apologize. As I mentioned, this situation is extremely fluid.  I also mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the Governor, it was agreed that the meetings would continue, every day, until the thing got resolved.  I was just informed that I've been elected by my management to be on today's call (Steve Kean and I will be our representatives).  It starts at 1PM.  We are scheduled to talk at 2:30 PM.  I'm hoping--but not altogether hopeful---that the call will end before 2:30.  I can't apologize enough for the scheduling problems, particularly since I'm the one who originated the request to chat with Laura.  We can do it one of several ways; it's completely your call:  1) play it by ear, and I can let you know around 2:15 if I think the call's going to wrap up by 2:30.  2) we can reschedule (I would of course very much like to brief Laura on what's going on). 3) you can decide it's too much trouble and throw up your hands, which I would understand.  Let me know how you 'd like to proceed and please give my sincere apologies (and best) to Laura.  I have to get on the call right now, so if you need to speak to a live person, give Joseph a call at 415.782.7841.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Alan:  In our ongoing analysis of the MOU, and in our attempt to put together a solution for California, we need to do a reality check on the implied curves the Governor's consultants are using to arrive at their rate proposals.  To ensure an "apples to apples" comparison, we're hoping to get our curve data for 24X7 power, averaged on a quarterly basis, from 2001-2010.  Hoping that you can get that for us.  That possible?  Let me know.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 1) if he's got 30 minutes, then he should join for 30 minutes. 2) quite urgent, since the analysis needs to be done pronto. 3) if he can't join, that's ok.  we can fill him after the meeting.    Joseph Alamo 05/10/2001 03:11 PM

 OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is the analysis that you're already working on:  Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03. Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 years). Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the short for the core) Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.  Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Maureen:  Could you ask Steve if he will be able to make the 4:30 (CST) with Laura Tyson?  I think you 've got the call-in number. Tell him it's not big deal if he can't--I can handle--but if he can, it might be useful for him to be on the line.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group ain't happy about the rate increas= e=20 (surprise). 
 So does this mean we're right where we left off with respect to status of bills like wind-fall profits, jails for generators, etc.?    Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 05/10/2001 05:28 PM 
 You are so sweet.  Thank you.  WHAT are you doing working so late????!!!!! 
 See Riordon note below. 
 Thank you.    James D Steffes 05/11/2001 09:10 AM 
 Will do.    Steven J Kean 05/11/2001 08:35 AM 
 Great.  Thanks.  I intended, and will be sure, to include Karen on the stuff that I pull together today.  Karen, if there's anything else I need to do to coordinate.  Best, Jeff    Janel Guerrero 05/11/2001 10:56 AM 
 Take a look.  Interesting stuff.  I'd say it further adds to our momentum. 
 The world is mighty small.  As an undergrad at Berkeley, I worked as a paralegal at Brobeck.  One of the "associates" I reported to was, you guessed it, Gary Fergus. Haven't seen him since.  Will be interested to compare notes.    MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> 09/29/2000 06:26 PM 
 I don't have an attachment. 
 plz see email for hertzberg talking points for phone call.  turning to CEO materials now. jeff 
 This looks fantastic.  I apologize profusely. I've got a dozen assigments to finish by COB.  But having read this, you obviously needed no help from me. Let me know how the call with Riordan goes.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 05/11/2001 02:16 PM 
 Got message re: letter from Sherman to OPIC.  I'm in all day Monday. Best, Jeff 
 Hi Maureen: Could you please make sure that Steve gets these? Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Michael:  did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers?  I would worry about that (particularly since we use the MOU QF/IOU gen numbers).  I suggest that we use the MOU load numbers for the three utilities, since the PUC numbers seem real screwy e.g., they have PG&E's load being smaller than Edison.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI, another arrow in our quiver:  ? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed California that "the only way the state will improve its credit rating and look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the undercollected." 
 Yes, please submit my name.  Thanks a bunch.  I'll be talking about everything.    MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 05/11/2001 04:50 PM 
 I am swamped.  Please call me from your car when you start driving to the= =20 City (preferably when you're close to the City so that I can get some more = of=20 this work done). 
 Bibi's the man---he's the guy I mentioned when we discussed the other night. 
 Hi:  O lord.  You know, the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have time to think about things and absorb it.  But work has gotten so insane that I sympathize with your plight (since mine's the same).  I think I've maybe made it to 1/2--that's 1/2--of the finance classes.  NORTH of Sacramento.  Are you driving to Sacramento every day?  Say it ain't so.  That's brutal.  When you say full time, you mean school full time?  That, I assume, means leaving your job?  Be happy to talk about it.  You know me---believer in always keeping all options open and active.  If full time makes sense, you ought to do it.  Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'll be missing class (again) on Tuesday because I have to be in Portland.  If you're not going to Sac on Monday, coffee in SF during work hours works.  Or I could meet you during break on Monday.  Or we could have lunch or a beer after work on Thursday or Friday when I'm back from Portland.  Hang in there.  I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground again.  Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.  Let me know what works for you.  Best, Jeff  PS  I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case. Hope that's modest consolation.  "Strategizing?!"   (I don't think so.)    Courtney Abernathy <courtney_abernathy@yahoo.com> 09/30/2000 07:52 PM 
 can we use the MOU total load numbes (e.g., 93 GWH for PG&E) and divide it up using the proportions in the PG&E numbers? 
 Greetings Piper:  My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.  I think you've spoken with Karen Denne.  Scott asked for some background materials on our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.  I'll be forwarding those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.  Does that work for you?  Best, Jeff Dasovich Enron Corp 415.782.7822 
 agreed.    Michael Tribolet/ENRON@enronXgate 05/11/2001 05:33 PM 
 Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.  Said she'd heard that Ken Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron buying Edison's transmission system.  I told her that Enron is not in the market for transmission systems.  Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the nukes.  Best, Jeff 
 Amen.    Mark Palmer 05/11/2001 06:36 PM 
 Please, please keep Dave out of it.  Note to follow.    Karen Denne 05/11/2001 07:02 PM 
 It'll be to you in about 10-15 minutes. 
 Attached is additional background on the solution that Ken Lay discussed today and that Enron is proposing as a comprehensive solution to California's electricity crisis.  If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822 or on my pager at 888.916.7184.  Best regards, Jeff 
 chk vmail when you get a chance. best,jeff 
 Thanks.  That certainly puts things in perspective. 
 You're much too kind.  Thanks for the feedback.  My brains just about spilled out end of the day Friday.  Spent the weekend in a haze.  Best, Jeff 
 coincidentally i did see governor backbone on the show.  i don't think that we can count on him toning it down anytime soon, which will not be helpful in getting a solution out here.  best, Jeff 
 OUR christi nicolay?    Susan M Landwehr 05/13/2001 10:19 PM 
 I'll be on the call.  Hope all's well on your end. Best, Jeff    Jeffery Fawcett/ENRON@enronxgate 05/14/2001 09:15 AM 
 I saw "the event" re-reun on local cable access TV (randomly viewed on Saturday).  It was not pretty and Jeanne did a great job of remaining calm and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence!  Unfortunately, I wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers, but a large bouquet is certainly in order.  Best, Jeff    Leslie Lawner 05/14/2001 10:17 AM 
 Thank you very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Piper: The email I sent on Friday to Scott McNealy's address (listed below) got bounced back to me.  Just wanted to make sure that you folks received the materials.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East. As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try to advance the ball.  I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Hello Sarah: My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I work for Enron in Enron's San Francisco office. Last Friday, the Chairman of our company, Ken Lay, met with Kevin Sharer and other CEOs from California to discuss the energy crisis in California and the need to develop as soon as possible a comprehensive solution to the problem. Mr. Sharer asked for some additional background on the issues and the solution and asked that you be contact person.  That information is attached. If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822 or on my pager at 888.916.7184.

 Ditto.  I vote that we suggest to Christine that 5's too darned unwieldy and that she look for another, smaller group.  And if she's unable to find one then we can talk.    Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 10/02/2000 11:19 AM 
 I'll assume that you'll follow up with Piper on this? Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Can we meet at 5 pm CDT/3 PM PDT to see where we are on the analysis? Best, Jeff 
 Hi Twanda: I can make the call.  Best, Jeff

 Thank.  Talk to you then.  Best, Jeff    Kortney Brown/ENRON@enronXgate 05/14/2001 03:00 PM 
 Your call.  Let us know what we can do to help.  Best, Jeff 
 Simon did a nice job on the presentation, but I need some things re-arranged, added, etc.  Should I call him directly, other?  Let me know.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 you getting pages in Tokyo?  jeff 
 thx for call.  no about plan "B" but haven't seen anything on paper.  jeff 
 s. govenar is faxing me a copy.  thx very much for the info.  jeff 
 Man, you rule!  Good job.  I'll give you a call. 
 Thanks.  Will be very interested to hear how the meeting goes.  My sense is that the timing could be just about right. Best, Jeff    Hedy Govenar <hgovenar@govadv.com> 05/14/2001 05:51 PM 
 I can make either time.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Scott Reblitz@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/14/2001 05:48 PM 
 It was a beautiful day (and evening).  Congratulations to you both.  It is a very sweet thing for two very sweet people, and I'm sort of choked up for being asked to be in the wedding party.  It was a great day for everybody. Congratulations.  Best, Jeff  Beware, the mighty reefer.... 
 Maureen:  Few things.  I was on the call with Steve today and he asked me to do a couple of things.  1) Send a summary of today's call to the email list that you've put together.  I've got the list from the note you forwarded to me with the call-in info for today's call.  Is that the complete list?  If not, could you foward me the most recent one, which I'll use to distribute the summary?  2) Could you set up another call for this Friday (May 18th) for 60 minutes at 10 CDT/8 AM PDT, and distribute to the same bunch of folks that were on today's call?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Best, Jeff 
 Plz call.  Any numbers yet?  Skilling talking to Gov today?   415.782.7822. 
 Got a message from PG&E.  Open season will be for 2003 and beyond and they'll be accepting bids up to 30 years.  Will talk to PG&E and get back with more information.  If you having any questions give a holler at 415.782.7822.  Best, JEff 
 FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail that wags the dog.  P.S.  I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.  Looks like about $75K for three months.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/14/2001 08:07 PM 
 Great suggestions.  Thanks so much for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.  Best, Jeff  SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.  The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) 
 FYI. 
 I can do tomorrow. 
 Thanks a million.  FYI, I meant to send you a "thank you" note in response to the note with Friday call-in info, but it went to Steve instead.  Best, Jeff    Maureen McVicker 05/15/2001 09:30 AM 
 Rick/Paul:  Message(s) received loud and clear.  I'll await Paul's email and proceed according to that plan.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 10:44 AM 
 FYI. 
 Wow.  Don't worry about it.  Have a great time in Montana.  It will be gorgeous up there.  You're camped out in Roseville?  You don't deserve that, Courtney.  Good idea to find out when the deadlines are.  When you get back, give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or something.  Considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea and the right thing to do.  Don't stress too much.  Good luck and can't wait to hear about Big Sky.  Best, Jeff    Courtney Abernathy <courtney_abernathy@yahoo.com> 10/01/2000 09:56 PM 
 Enron will very vigorously support the CS and I would hope that we could get as many people as possible to do the same.  Let's face it, California's gas industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess (despite, and perhaps contrary to, the substantially more narrow reasoning offered by the Brattle Group).  The CS is a well-thought-out, well-designed program for moving forward; unlike the "interim," which takes two steps back.  Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call them and try to get them to show up in support?  Best, Jeff    Tom Beach <tomb@crossborderenergy.com> 05/14/2001 11:37 PM 
 How's this look?  Steve Kean Rick Shapiro (GA) Paul Kaufman (GA) Vicki Sharpe (EES) Mike D. Smith (EES) Chris Calger (ENA) Karen Denne (PA) 
 Thanks.  I'll get you one more name then.  FYI:  To use a Kaufman phrase, "I'm a little frosted."  I'm on a litigation call, on which I mentioned the Plan B (which I got only because I searched out Scott Governor yesterday).  On the call Sandi said, "Jeff, there's a response from the Governor to the Plan B, which I faxed to Steffes yesterday."  I want you to know that I took a deep breath, and asked Sandi to fax it to the San Francisco office.  Unreal....  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 11:38 AM 
 Thanks Robert: One caution.  It's important that the first-cut analysis be "simple" and uses, to the maximum extent possible, the MOU numbers and modeling.  This allows us to explain a complex situation to people who aren't necessarily "numbers oriented" and to do so with an "apples-to-apples"  comparison. That's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's important to have, at the outset, the cleanest, simplest version of "here's what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model."  That said, I understand that even with the simple base case, some tweeks are likely.   Talk to you in an hour.  Thanks again for the help.  Best, Jeff     Robert Neustaedter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/15/2001 11:24 AM 
 I am on back to back conference calls.  What would you like me to do to help get materials prepared for Ken Lay?  I'm available at about 11:45 AM my time if you'd like to try to talk then.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 What are the details for tomorrow? 
 Looks complete to me.  No comments.  Best, Jeff    Paul Kaufman/ENRON@enronXgate 05/15/2001 11:30 AM 
 sorry to bother you with this, but could you please fax me the governor's response to plan B?  thx, jeff 
 Monday--In office Tuesday--Portland--Meet with ENA Wednesday--Portland Thursday--In office Friday--Vacation day possibly 
 My apologies in the delay getting this to you.  Best, Jeff 
 Was a pleasure.  Never hesitate to get in touch if you need anything.  Best of luck.  Look forward to working with you folks.  Best, Jeff 
 As always, can't thank you enough.  I get the sense that Loretta's decision will have to get somewhat friendlier to business (and our poor economy).  Best, Jeff    Hedy Govenar <hgovenar@govadv.com> 05/15/2001 01:57 PM

 You going to brief me tonite on tomorrow's meeting? 
 You did an absolutely fabulous job on Sunday.  It was a great time, the food was extraordinary, and the wine was better still.  Thanks so much for it all.  You're very sweet.  Almost makes any more engagements superfluous, don't you think.  (kidding!)  Don't forget to water the tomatoes!  Best, Jeff    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/15/2001 11:27 AM 
 Thanks for the commnets, Lynn.  I've faxed you a copy of "Plan B."  I'll let others chime in, but ideally it seemsthat we'd want to start the meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed, comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion.  But at a minimum we'd want to get "the process" nailed down by very early next week.  Best, Jeff     Lynn.A.Lednicky@dynegy.com 05/15/2001 07:34 AM 
 will do.  Thanks. 
 Thanks very much.    Joseph Alamo 05/15/2001 05:24 PM

 "Plan B" As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that has been working on a "Plan B." They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's MOU with Edison. The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU. First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis may be emerging. Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to require a lot more work to get right. Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable. On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it to the Legislature to take the lead role. The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter. Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of the discount that suppliers would be willing to take. The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable. The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the process of negotiations underway. Next Steps If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet separately to discuss next steps. Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies. Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."  Sandi mentioned that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor hired to advise him on the crisis. If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll get it to you.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem.  We will fax it to you.  Best, Jeff    "Edmonds, Sonnet" <sonnet.edmonds@mirant.com> 05/15/2001 02:43 PM

 Greetings.  Will there be a call-in number?  Best, Jeff 
 never mind.  I actually bothered to read the ENTIRE note and answered by own question.  Apologies.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry, but thanks. 
 Here's the edited version (word document format).  If you have any questions, just give me a ring at 415.782.7822.  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff

 Very nice touch; particularly the opening paragraph.  You do good memos. Should one expect any fireworks?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Maureen:  Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.  The letter 1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key components of a comprehensive solution.  Could you please get a copy of the letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken Lay?    Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll buckle up.  P.S. 1Scott faxed you a letter from Cox and Brulte to Hertzberg and Burton. Check  it out.  It's a pretty darned smart letter:  1) very cooperative 2) substantively attractive and rational.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry I had to get off the call early.  Hope it helped.  If there's anything else you need, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 yep.  it's on its way. 
 aye aye.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/16/2001 10:06 AM 
 FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go figure.  Best, Jeff 
 Ok, cut the shakespeare.  What's your vote?  She wrote again in inquiring. 
 Thank you for the feedback.  We're "sanitizing" the document a wee bit (taking out the "opposing view--response" part).  When that's done, I assume it will OK to distribute.  Karen?  Best, Jeff    Susan M Landwehr 05/15/2001 11:12 PM 
 I'm trying to meet a deadline at the moment, but are you free this afternoon?  I have some information that can help a lot in that analysis.  Best, Jeff    Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 12:19 PM 
 I'll give you a call then.    Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 12:26 PM 
 Few changes made.  Here it is.  Best, Jeff 
 The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that old wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).  Possible for you guys to come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on Thursday.  I'm going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul it away.  If Cameron has to work are you available?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll do it, babe. 
 Apologies.  Can we make it 4?    Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate 05/16/2001 12:26 PM

 got message.  thanks. will talk to michael tribolet.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks.  talk to you then. 
 Hi Christine:  Yes, forwarded the email you sent last week.  Here's where folks came out. First, we think that the folks in your first group are mean.  Second, it's a real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will break the camel's back.  Suggestion came up that it might be much more mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first.  If there's a problem finding a smaller group, then we could try to do five and hope the ship don't sink?  Sound reasonable?  Best, Jeff    Christine Piesco <christine.piesco@oracle.com> 10/02/2000 01:14 PM

 The dinner was incredibly delicious.  Thank you very much.  I apologize for being so late--increasingly I have less and less control over my schedule. Would have much preferred to have spent it with you guys.  And sorry that I pooped out so early---I'm running on zero sleep and had a 7:30 conference call this morning.  That said, the dinner was really extraordinary.  You guys outdid yourself. Made an others tough day very nice.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 u see letter from barry goode to u re: lawsuits NOT on table?  jeff 
 PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado. It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines. The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord. The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31. Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03. Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want). Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103. About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed "Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02). As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03). PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date. In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date. The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado. How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing. No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).  Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.  Best, Jeff 
 it was really good.  how'd you cut up those damned potatoes like that?    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 05/18/2001 12:16 PM

 I have to go to Portland tomorrow, coming back Wednesday afternoon. I'd like to see you tonite before I leave if you're available. 
 Michael Tribolet and I (about 99% Michael) have put together a rough cut analysis of the core/noncore structure, and some scenarios Hertzberg has asked for.  Hertzberg's expecting some info from us on Monday (and I'm sure that he'll want more scenarios, too).  Are you available first thing Monday morning to be briefed on the analysis, my conversations with Hertzberg, what Hertzberg's strategy is, etc.? 
 Can you talk early Monday AM w/me & Tribolet re: core/noncore analysis for Hertzberg?  Jeff 
 Thank you.  I will participate in the call.   Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Can you join? 
 need to chk w/Tribolet, but does 9:30 AM CDT on Monday work for you?  jeff 
 Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the issue......  Davis announces four new energy advisors   Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m. Gov. Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team.  Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new director of communications.  Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months.  Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal regulators and with generators.  Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.  Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers, Maviglio said.  -- Associated Press 
 No word from Steve.  Ken thought the meetings were very worthwhile, though he was pooped by the time he got to the airport.  We laughed (cried?) about Riordan during the car ride.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 05/18/2001 06:58 PM 
 8:30 AM PDT, every monday.  call-in = 800.998.2462  code = 4912753  be great if you could join regularly.  Best, Jeff 
 Nice job.  Only comment is that the crazies in California now find market power under every rock and in every pipeline.  I think there's a chance that someone might assert that 20% share equals market power.  Might want to say "significant supplier" or something similar.  No big deal, but I thought I'd flag it for your consideration.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes.    Jennifer Thome 05/21/2001 10:03 AM 
 On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to try to resolve it.  Attached are:  A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last week A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more detailed "backgrounder."  If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Seem like it's up to Cameron.  In the past, she's said that she doesn't like her B-Day to be included in the weekends' festivities.  I'm happy to celebrate then, though?  And happy to do anything else that anyone wants to do to celebrate.  Signed, Ooooolllll' Easy Goin'    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/21/2001 09:58 AM 
 You guys are stars.  Thanks so much for all you did for Prentice.  I think she had a really, really good time and felt really neat about the whole thing.  She's wonderful and you guys gave her the wonderful day that she earned and deserved.  Thanks so much.  And, as usual, thanks for being great hosts yesterday (Nancy, you outdid yourself with dinner).  OK, so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday night.  If you guys want, we can pack up the Suburban with everything that needs to go up ( or at least just about everything), and we can drive it up and then you two can take my SAAB up.  Then, coming back, you can drive the Suburban and I can drive the SAAB.  What do you think?  Finally, Eldon, do you have the Blue Book at your house?  I'm looking for the number of someone I can get to haul away all the crap (junk from around the generator shed, that rotten ol' pile of wood by the driveway, the un-salvagable wood from the old deck, etc.).  Can you find a couple "hauler" numbers in there and send me the numbers?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, my trunk can handle that easily.  Sounds like a plan!  I'm going to inform folks that I will be off Thursday/Friday.  I'll let you what reaction I get.     Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/21/2001 11:30 AM 
 Thanks. I should be there about 7.  You know that I love you very much, Prentice.

 Power shortage shifts attitudes Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001 BY NOAM LEVEY Mercury News Sacramento Bureau California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new poll shows. Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll. ``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very dramatic.'' Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide. Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and 6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top issue. And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply, demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great deal.'' ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a 46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose. Results dismissed The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very hard to communicate that in this state.'' South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004. The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's landmark deregulation five years ago. ``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose. Criticism for Davis But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading California out of its power troubles. Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the governor for not doing more. Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to control the price that California is being forced to pay for power. The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support price caps on electricity. Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power. The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the crisis. But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18 percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8 percent favored federal price controls on generators. That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of power to mine the California market for excessive profits. ``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants. Backing re-regulation Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will come when Californians' power bills start rising next month. ``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the only solution will be re-regulation.'' Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear, however. ``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people worry. ``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''    Mercury News Staff Writer Mike Zapler contributed to this report. 
 No problem.  Let's talk.  I'm really comfortably having you and me and your mom and keith talk about.  I'm very interested in buying Jay's property, but I don't even the details yet.  Here's my suggestion.  If they want to come up that bad, they should.  My agent is a very cool person up there.  Here name is Sharon Burningham.  She is with Coldwell Banker.  Her number is 707.884.5270.  ext. 308.  You should feel free to tell your mom that Prentice and I have always have the intention of buying Jay's place, and we've had a sort of unspoken agreement that he'd give us the first "head's up" when he decided to sell.  To be honest, we didn't expect it to be this quick, but hey, it is what it is.  You can also tell your mom that I'm very happy to talk about partnering with her.  But it's WAY to early right now.  As we discussed, I need to spend some time with Jay---the other very important thing for me is that Jay's a very good friend, and I want to protect that, too.  In the meantime, I think that it would be great for your mom and Keith to have Sharon take them around and show them some killer million--plus--dollar homes and have some fun cruising around and seeing what the area has to offer.  I'm real happy to call Sharon, too.  That sound like a plan?  Where can I call you?  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 05/21/2001 02:38 PM 
 Ditto.  Hope to get to see you in person again soon.  Lay said the CSU meeting went pretty well.  Best, Jeff 
 Oversight.  No other reason.  Thanks for noticing and letting me know.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 05/21/2001 04:03 PM 
 FYI.  Apologies for the oversight of not including you on the list.  If you have any questions, etc. just give a holler (415.782.7822).  Best, Jeff 
 Though I had a somewhat different notion when I initially raised the idea of co-sponsorship, I agree with Lee's observations and think that we should proceed the way he suggests. 
 OK gang, she's hell bent, and I've spent about as much time as I'm willing on this.  Sorry about the hassle---Jimmie, if you hadn't used that colorful language, we wouldn't be in this mess.  Anyway, unless I hear strong protests in the next 30 minutes, I'm writing back to say she can join (and has to do the next case all by her lonesome on the team's behalf as payback).  Lemme know.  Best, Jeff 
 Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file confidential.  Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers. Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates significantly above the Lynch rates. Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates again soon. In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which will require yet additional increases. I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive market and out from under Loretta). I will report back after we've spoken. All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 So far there's Wild Goose, but there in Northern California--have to go through the Wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt.  Lodi's a possibility, but it's well inland, unlike the significantly more strategic storage assets on the coast.  In addition, Lodi's in the process of selling, so there's some uncertainty in the short run.  Bottom line, folks are trying to build competitive storage, but it's in the "emerging" phase in a very hostile environment.  We should discuss further, though; very interesting idea.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 05/22/2001 08:45 AM 
 I'll have Joseph clean up the letter and send you the email/fax #'s etc. for the list, for the cards that I gathered.  Best, Jeff 
 The advocacy ad blitz has started.  I don't know if I have the title correct, but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).  The head of the committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, "the Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and "we" want to make sure that they're held accountable."  Best, Jeff 
 plz call as soon as you have a second.  thx, jeff 
 I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with pro bono financial advice on the crisis.  Hertzberg is still hot on putting all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south of 100% (if this thing gets legs).  Hertzberg asked for, and we provided today, a "fifth scenario," which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.  It's attached.  Will report back with any further developments.  Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with this one.  That file accidentally had the same cents/kwh, noncore rate for both Edison and PG&E.  Edison's rate should be 12.98 cents/kwh NOT 12.21 cents/kwh. It's the line that reads "Total cost to Noncore under CPUC's Recent Decision."  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is. 
 sigh....    Susan M Landwehr 05/22/2001 12:27 PM 
  Greetings Hap: Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.  Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up on filings like these in California prior to filing.  As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous forums.  Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.  Want to make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to get this ridiculous state back on track.  Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical. Thanks much.  Best, Jeff 
 Have messages in to him.    James D Steffes 10/02/2000 02:50 PM 
 Congratulations sweetie:  Everything OK?  So glad to hear.  All the best to all three of you.  Best, Jeff 
 Ideally, we'd leave earlier--gotta go to Napa to pick up the Suburban, Annie, etc.---but otherwise, let's try to leave as close to 9 pm as possible.  Best, Jeff 
 Duly noted.  I'll send you the latest.  I'll include you from this point on in the distribution list.  If it gets to be too much in your in-box, just let me know and I'll try to pare it back.  Here's the bottom line.  Folks have asked me to coordinate California to some degree and there'll be an expectation that we're well coordinated.  Again, this is not at all about making your life more difficult, just a case of being well-informed.  And my apologies for not having included you on the email distribution list sooner.  Best, Jeff    Hap Boyd 05/22/2001 03:01 PM 
 FYI.  We're trying to keep the stuff confidential.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much for the info Scott.  I'll give Allan a call.  Best, Jeff    Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 05/22/2001 04:22 PM 
 Was it an emergency bill? 
 plz call when you can. 415.782.7822. thx,jeff 
 To get from the California border down to Mexico, you would get service off of SoCalGas' and SDG&E's tariff (i.e., you have to wheel through SoCalGas and SDG&E to get there.  There may be a single tariff for that service, however (rather than taking service off of two tariffs).  I'll try to get the tariff numbers and get back to you.  All the tariffs are on Sempra's website.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings. Forgive the delays.  The meeting can largely be summarized by the CEC presentation.  I'll have Joseph email it to you.  In a nut shell, there's more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the consumer/business.  The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in California.  The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas infrastructure and do it quickly.   Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry for the delay.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 05/29/2001 12:01 PM

 Greetings: Have you seen this?  Any view on whether there's a group of economists who think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to this letter?  P.S. Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of this, but I wasn't altogether successful.  Best, Jeff 
 From Kirsten's second report, sounds like the core/noncore is getting longer legs and moving more quickly.  I'm concerned about Bev speaking on our behalf---only because her knowledge base is quite low---and plan on phoning her to ensure that she has the message down pat.  Thoughts?  Also, I've forewarded the econ letter to Teece to see if we can get the "manifesto" group to respond.  Best, Jeff 
 just calling them as i see them.  i WISH that i were glad to be back.  but who knows, this core/noncore thing just might work .  please keep all fingers and toes crossed indefinitely.  Best, jeff    Karen Denne 05/29/2001 02:50 PM

 The bad news is I left my bag with clothes and toiletries at the Dome.  The good news is it's a great excuse to have to go up again this weekend!  Thanks again for everything.  Really nice with only the principals---smaller, more intimate, less mess---and the ping pong table is a HUGE hit.  I hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as I enjoy yours.  Best, Jeff

 FYI. For future reference. 
 You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.  And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).  I'd be happy to talk about it if you want some time.  I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second "breaking away" (the one that comes after teen-age-dom).  So it's less about you and much more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).  I hope I'm not confusing matters more.

 Status of core/noncore proposal Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing. Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of "some parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal." Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.  Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors) They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats IOU past due) using their MOU numbers. They said that the model "can work" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this is pretty consistent with our analysis). Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me the results tomorrow AM. Hertzberg is coming up with "additional" twists, however. The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates down). Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B). In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't buy 20-year paper. Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in the event that credit isn't in place by July)  Conversation with the Chamber The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about, e.g., cost-shifting). They were very appreciative, liked the features of our proposal (again) and we agreed to stay in close contact.  Finally, I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn.  Best, Jeff 
 For some reason, the sites not opening.  I'll keep trying and keep you informed.  Best, Jeff 
 You are most welcome, indeed.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 05/30/2001 09:55 AM 
 What time's the show?  Do we know what station?  Here are my points:  Stop the blame; stop the political rhetoric. If there's evidence that manipulation has occured, produce it--the investigations have been going on for a year.  Stop the McCarthyist tactics. Californians want a real, comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan More supply Less demand No state takeovers; state out of procurement now. A real energy market place (competition and choice) Creditworthy utilities (prices that reflect the true cost of power)     Karen Denne 05/30/2001 11:31 AM 
 you win the big prize! 
 I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his caucus.  Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.  I can make out, however, that it is the core/noncore plan.  I'm attempting to get a better copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.  Please keep confidential that we have a copy.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks:  Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.  Best, Jeff  P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; Hertzberg has it at about 20%. 
 u won't believe this (o yes u will).  karen just called and told me that the event's been cancelled. but don't cancel anything until i get a chance to talk to her live first.  thanks, jeff    Joseph Alamo 05/30/2001 03:25 PM 
 Jennifer: To my knowledge, there's been no decision made to date on this issue of exit fees, either at the PUC or the legislature.  But it's my understanding that the rate increases just imposed by the PUC will NOT apply to DA customers. What happens to customers who switch today, I'm not sure.  Jeanne, any thoughts?    Joseph Alamo 05/30/2001 01:49 PM

 Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief Thursday, May 31, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M N231235.DTL Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers. The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created. "We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and "noncore" users. SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would be those using more than 500 kilowatts. Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar panels, on contract with the utility. That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity. Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to make themselves energy self-sufficient. The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would shift exclusively to the big users. Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates. Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. EDISON 'ENCOURAGED' Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan. A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. "I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution." Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. "We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. "When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," Smith said. Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. They don't want voters to pay because they vote." CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers. "I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," Rosenfield said. The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines. In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

 Municipal utilities warned Governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/31/MN154796.DTL Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators. Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies. The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 power alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities. In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices. He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance. "We're going to get that power one way or another," Davis said. Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California, there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento and Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state. 30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities. He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects full details to be made available within 30 days. Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents, insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations. The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent. RUDE AWAKENING While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Davis needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emulate the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets. Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis insisted they are required to do by law. He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as California faces a summer of potential blackouts. The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed "to make most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market." Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration. Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still "trying very hard to promote this notion that we're all in this together." While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800 megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways. Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes. Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities Association in Sacramento. "I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or involuntarily," the governor said. UNCERTAIN FUTURE It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way. In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in rolling blackouts during power shortages. "I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can turn on their lights somewhere else," said Alan Vallow, director of the utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents.

 To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today. I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes sense.  I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.  Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.  They view it as unfair and punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."  Many questioned Keeley about why the Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.  Keely said that the Assembly is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the Senate (read "Burton").  Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of information used to build the proposal.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  Did we talk to Leopold?  Might be useful to stress that that under noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of competing providers for their service, not just Enron.  Best, Jeff    California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue By Jason Leopold ? 18:00 ET Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would be on the hook. In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this week. The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so "desperate" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse residential consumers out of the equation. "The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing out Edison," the aide said. "We're looking to take the burden off of residential ratepayers." The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as non-core customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its $5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills. Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts. Enron Pushing Access to Customers Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs. Burton and Hertzberg said. An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the California Chamber of Commerce. Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with companies like Enron for their power. Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in place of the utilities. The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in April. The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement forward. State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate energy committee, said there are so many "Plan B's" floating around the Legislature that, "We're going to need to hire an apiculturist." Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's "core and non-core" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions. It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said. Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. "This [plan] would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said. "We just got hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our businesses to other states."

 Greetings Senator:  I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your message has been forwarded to him.  In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks ago.  It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker Hertzberg).  Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss solutions to California's electricity crisis.  But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have been incurred on their behalf.  I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule permits.  I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you would like to talk before Monday.  If there's anything else I can do, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff Dasovich 
 I think you're dead on.    Karen Denne 05/31/2001 08:01 PM 
 Not at all.  Should I talk to Jason on background and set him straight? 
 Municipal utilities lambaste Davis threat to seize power David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, June 1, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/01/MN17670.DTL California municipal utilities reacted with shock and anger yesterday to Gov. Gray Davis' threat to seize their excess power if they did not slash prices to below-market rates. "I feel totally betrayed," said George Fraser, general manager of the Northern California Power Agency, an association of 14 municipal utilities. "It's clear to me that the governor doesn't understand the power business." This new dimension to the state's energy woes came as authorities issued their first one-hour warning of imminent blackouts in the Bay Area, only to cancel the warning an hour later when additional power supplies were found. Davis told The Chronicle in an interview Wednesday that some city-owned municipal utilities had charged even higher electricity prices than the out-of- state generators he has accused of gouging California consumers. He said he was prepared to use his executive authority "to get that power one way or another" if the utilities did not lower their prices. The state so far has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity on behalf of cash- strapped Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. "What the governor said makes no sense whatsoever," said Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association. "He was definitely off-base." Jordan said most municipal utilities already provided all surplus power to California's electricity market. However, he said, the municipals buy power at market rates to meet their own shortfalls, and thus have a responsibility to their customers -- local city residents -- to sell any excess supplies at the same sky-high price levels. "Our utilities are going to do what they can to help the state of California," Jordan said. "But they aren't going to do that at the expense of customers." Davis' threat followed a meeting last week with the heads of about a dozen municipal utilities. Participants said the tone of the discussion was generally cordial, and it was understood the governor's office would work up a plan for future electricity purchases. Davis' threat came out of the blue, they said. "We're willing to sell our excess power," said John Roukema, assistant director of Silicon Valley Power in Santa Clara. "But we have to deal with the same market conditions that the governor does." Davis doesn't see it that way. He believes that many municipal utilities are exploiting California's power shortage in the same way that out-of-state generators are walking off with billions of dollars in windfall profits. The governor's top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, said in an interview yesterday that Davis' threat to seize the municipals' power was intended as a reminder that the state expected prompt action on the issue. "We want to be sure that the municipals are not just talking the talk but doing what they say," Freeman said. He said municipal utilities should be selling surplus power at the same level it cost to generate electricity, plus a reasonable markup of about 15 percent. Freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter. Before signing on with the Davis administration, he was head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, by far the state's largest municipal utility. The Los Angeles department has been accused by both federal and state officials of charging some of the highest prices of all for electricity. Earlier this year, it was asking as much as $1,400 per megawatt hour for its output. Frank Salas, the department's chief operating officer, said such prices were necessitated by high production expenses. "We were just recovering our costs," he said. For his part, Freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his watch. "There was tremendous pressure on me to charge more," he said of urgings from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other local officials for higher profits, demands that Freeman said he had resisted. "That pressure may have increased now that I'm gone," he said. "I don't know what they're doing now." The Department of Water and Power's Salas countered that Freeman should know exactly what his former colleagues were doing. "We have the same pricing structure now that we had when he was boss," he said. Fraser at the Northern California Power Agency said it was strange that Davis would be so aggressive in his dealings with the municipals, which provide only about 15 percent of the state's power needs. "He's kicking the little guy," he said. "He's picking on us because he can." E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. 
 I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.  The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear something. 
 Carolyn Kepplinger (sp?) is calling me---no doubt to talk about core/noncore.  Her number's 202.383.2119.  You want to take it? (I hope you say yes.)  Best, Jeff 
 works for me, though i have to hop at 2 pm for another call.  Best, Jeff    Sandra McCubbin 06/01/2001 12:28 PM 
 Dude: No problem.  Sean paid me for his and Molly's dinner and Eldon and Nancy will pay me for theirs.  No problem on the toast--I'm sure the favor will be repaid many times over.  Rite Spot is always great.  I actually got to bed by 11:30, so I was OK yesterday.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 05/31/2001 01:42 PM 
 Talked to Prentice.  She's up for golf, so expect us Saturday night.  Best, Jeff  P.S. Don't forget to water! 
 House power subcommittee. 
 The original proposed messages I distributed for the high tech sector have been put into a power point presentation and include comments received. Many thanks to Margaret Carson, who did much of the heavy lifting.   Additional comments are welcome and suggestions on how to spice up the korny title slide are greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 you're a regulatory laugh riot.  see you then.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 06/01/2001 12:57 PM 
 see yesterday's and today's chronicle  re: price gouging by in-state, municipally-owned utility generators.  will be interesting to see if any anti-trust claims start flying their way.  see you this weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll try to remember my check book....    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 06/01/2001 01:01 PM 
 I'm trying.  I've got cauliflower ear from all the phone calls.  I'll be in Sacramento Monday.  Will keep you apprised.  I followed up with a call to Brulte and I'll try to meet with him on Monday, too.  Best, Jeff    Karen Denne 06/01/2001 01:01 PM 
 12:30 works for me.  2-330 does not.    Joseph Alamo 06/01/2001 01:32 PM 
 sounds great.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 06/01/2001 01:27 PM 
 Looks great.  I'd like to be able to pick it up at 7 AM.  Thanks very much for the assistance.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 06/01/2001 12:59 PM 
 I recommend that you wait.  I've got a Brazil-focused commercial contact internally that I would like for you to meet with first.  Best, Jeff 
 Got bounced back the first time. 
 will miss you.  hope you have a good trip.  as it turns out, i'm in sacramento all week in close door negotiations trying to settle california's electricity mess.  keep your fingers and toes crossed!  best, jeff 
 i'm very willing, but if it has to be done this week, it ain't going to happen----traveling, hair on fire, etc.  let me know.  hey, did you change jobs?  if so, congratulations.  nice title.  best, Jeff    Joseph Tambornino <josephtambornino@yahoo.com> 06/04/2001 06:52 PM Please respond to josepht 
 Thanks.  I have a contact.  When can you be in Sao Paolo next?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  I am completely buried.  This is is blown.  I'll be in town tonite and= =20 tomorrow nite and we can discuss more then if you like.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, but ain't gonna happen this week.  We'll have to wait till he gets back.  Best, Jeff    Rob Bradley 06/04/2001 08:02 AM 
 I'll need clubs, and I'm right handed. Thanks so much.  Best, Jeff    Ginger Dernehl 06/06/2001 09:49 AM 
 And a very good morning to you!    Maureen McVicker 06/06/2001 09:04 AM 
 Haven't checked my calendar, but I plan to come.  Been WAY too long.  Best, Jeff    Kari Ontko <kontko@home.com> 06/03/2001 05:28 PM Please respond to kontko 
 This got bounced back, too. 
 Hi Lee: Do you know what the subject of the proceeding is?  I'm traveling, but will try to get you info.  Best, Jeff    Lee Huber 06/05/2001 09:34 AM 
 sounds good. let's catch up tomorrow nite.  Best, Jeff    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 06/06/2001 12:14 PM 
 congratulations on the promotion.  let me know what i can do if the effort's still underway next week.  Best, Jeff    Joseph Tambornino <josephtambornino@yahoo.com> 06/06/2001 12:06 PM Please respond to josepht 
 sounds good.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 06/06/2001 12:43 PM 
 Lee: Check the PUC website for information---it sounds like the PUC's inquiry into the adequacy of SoCal's insfrastructure, i.e., in state transportation. Should be a lot about it on their website (www.cpuc.ca.gov).  If you come up empty, leave me a voicemail (415.782.7822) and I'll track things down.  Best, Jeff    Lee Huber 06/06/2001 11:11 AM 
 We're on at 9:30 AM California time.  I'll call you early in the AM to confirm, coordinate, ruminate, etc.  Best, Jeff 
 Christine:  Sorry I haven't replied sooner.  Crazy day.  Consider yourself the 5th member of our team---but remember, no warranties included.  Best, Jeff 
 There you go again, always demanding substance.  I'll fill you in tomorrow on why it's so high level (and repetitive). Believe it or not, Larry Ellison (CEO Oracle) and Scott McNealy (CEO Sun) is the audience--neither's real up to speed on the industry.  PS How's the cover memo for the strategy coming?  Best, Jeff 
 The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.  He's intrigued about the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.  Governor and his folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be another call next Monday.  Will fill you in as things progress.  Thanks again for the pricing sheet.  Please keep all of this highly confidential.  Best, Jeff 
 As my mother likes to say, "You should be on the stage....  the one that left an hour ago." 
 I was worried about this.  Sent it Monday night.  Kept getting bounced back. Could you page me at 888.916.7184 and let me know that you get it?  I'm in Portland.  Also, got Ginger's message re: paragraph on TW deal.  Steffes said you didnt' need right away because EBR got cancelled.  When do you need and do you want just background, or valuation calculations, too? Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Will you send a note to folks regarding the GA meeting here in SF next Thursday? 
 Will do.    Richard Shapiro 10/04/2000 08:58 AM 
 I like the idea.  Particularly in view of the "California Crisis."  Makes our positions that much more compelling and offers at least part of the "solution" for California.    Robert Frank 10/03/2000 01:01 PM 
 Attached are the high tech slides with the correct figure for dollars that the high tech sector spent on electricity in 1999. 
 I'm sure that you'll have a great time arguing our case before the court.  If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.  P.S.  How's things?    Marcie Milner 10/03/2000 11:59 AM 
 Our meetings will be much more effective you attend.  We should try to talk tomorrow or Friday.    Robert Frank 10/04/2000 09:37 AM 
 Good questions for which I don't currently have answers.    James D Steffes 10/03/2000 10:17 AM 
 If it's truly the real thing.  I'll take two cases.  Thanks for asking.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/04/2000 11:49 AM 
 I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I can't recall, I'm sending to all.  First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the "clarifications" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a fatal flaw--significant probability.)  Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)  Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with something remotely similar.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Let me know when you would like to discuss the "value" that GA brought to our pipeline group. (We discussed it when I was in Houston week before last.)  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Sarah.  Question:  Could we, and should we, attempt to pre-empt the FERC report and try to get press coverage of the BP paper before FERC releases the results of its investigation?    Sarah Novosel 10/04/2000 11:58 AM 
 real meaning real acacia.  don't care about labeling.  what would you compare to in quality?  seems to me that one can't beat $5/bottle for acacia, non? what cheese?  man, you saw a great game.  i was portland for the past couple days, saw some of the game yesterday at the airport (plane was delayed).  GO GIANTS!    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/05/2000 10:31 AM 
 Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.  Also, one question:  Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have that right? 
 If you have any questions, don't hesitate. 
 Hey, no problem.  I'll call Badeer.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/05/2000 01:02 PM 
 Steve:  Let me know if you'd like to discuss.  I like Tim's idea re: maybe you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with Schroeder re: Littlechild.  Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am surprised to see it turn up in print.  Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one but that we're always interested in working together.  Best, Jeff    Tim Belden@ECT 10/05/2000 01:00 PM 
 Between you and me, I don't think California is an option at this point. 
 Mr. DeMille would like to know if you're ready for your close-up.    Susan Scott 10/05/2000 01:50 PM 
 Couple of thoughts:  In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to a pounding they're taking from Wall Street). This will likely increase the pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t. finding a way out of the IOU undercollection problem.   The increased pressure to act in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.   Regarding the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having the adminstration cook up something less preferable. 
 I doubt that anyone in accounting has it, and I'm not sure to whom in accounting to send it.  Suggestions?  I think that Bowen & Co. could likely help us out on this first filing.  Also, Sue, regarding NY:  I have a call into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up.  Haven't heard back yet.    Sue Nord 10/05/2000 02:08 PM 
 FYI.  According to Roger, if the freeze is extended out toward 2004 for PG&E and Edison, his book makes BIG money. 
 FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation. Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier." Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the next version of the slides.  Few points:  There are a few holes (pre-quals and process in particular)--my brain began to fail.  But I think there's enough of a structure so that we can easily finalize by tomorrow. I didn't have an electronic version of Whaley's slides, so I couldn't integrate them.  But I don't think it will take much to do the integration. Some of Whaley's slides have a strong marketing slant--we should think hard about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity. We still have some wordsmithing to do re: participate, run the auction, or participate and run the auction.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I love you, too.   Seriously, appreciate the feedback.  I was working from a great first cut.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/05/2000 08:02 PM 
 no classes.  just lots of studying.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/05/2000 08:13 PM 
 Agree completely.  Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, etc.  Just a thought.  Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the quick action/message we're looking for.    James D Steffes 10/05/2000 08:30 PM 
 Anyone out there know why FERC has asked the PX for still more data? 
 Richard:  Looks good.  One comment:  Under the section "Generating Documents:  Requests 12, 14 and 18,"  I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending."  To further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of increased wholesale purchases.  Paul Kaufman would have details of the request.  Hope your son's doing well.  Best, Jeff    Richard B Sanders@ECT 10/06/2000 09:16 AM 
 I can be on the call. 
 Mitch:  Paul Kaufman mentioned that you'd like to see the testimony that Steve Kean (at a congressional field hearing in San Diego) and I (at a FERC field hearing in San Diego) gave a few weeks ago.  Steve had prepared remarks. They are attached.  I did not have prepared remarks, but I've attached my talking points.  My talking points were not made public, however, so please keep them private.  Finally, I'm trying to get a transcript of the FERC hearing.  If you would like a copy, please let me know.  And if there's anything else that I can do, please don't hestitate to contact me.  Best, Jeff 
 BEEP stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the ISO develops on the basis of bids and offers.  The problem is that the plants the ISO ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order developed from the bids/offers, and the ISO has never been clear about the decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch.  Everyone, including Belden, thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent. 
 does tomorrow work? 
 Yes, will be on call. 
 I apologize for being tardy.  I can have my IRS to you by Monday. 
 Hi Delaney:  I won't need a room.  Did you want me to participate on a panel?  If so, which day and at what time?  Who else will be on the panel?  Inquiring minds would love to know.  Best, Jeff      "Delaney Hunter" <dhunter@smithandkempton.com> 10/05/2000 07:01 PM Please respond to dhunter 
 Susan Scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group (TW).  I met her as part of the California PUC's gas restructuring case.  For some time she's been inquiring about Government Affairs.  She called me yesterday and mentioned that she's very  interested in exploring if there are any opportunities in GA.  From my experience, Susan is highly competent and very professional and I think TW would say the same.  She likes her work but wants a new challenge.  I told her I'd inquire about whether someone would be interested in talking with her. I think that it would be useful for you to chat with her.  Thoughts?  Susan would like to keep it confidential at this point. 
 I don't think that the stranded cost issue has been squarely addressed. 
 Has Sue gotten in touch with you.  And have you contacted Tim Belden in Portland?  He is the absolute guru on this stuff. 
 Lee:  I'm not certain that it will be possible to get Skilling, but I'll get back to you soon.  Also, I want to manage expectations a bit about the possibility of having Enron stream the conference.  Just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.  I'd prefer that it not go out in any announcement at this juncture.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff    "Lee S. Friedman" <lfried@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 10/04/2000 05:52 PM 
 Couple of brief comments:  1) There is a new and growing drum beat to reduce California's wholesale price caps further (i.e., below $250, with some suggesting $100).  We need to discuss strategy very soon. 2)  I'm attempting to arrange a meeting between ENA (Calger) and Sempra (CFO) to discuss commercial opportunities. 
 FYI. Great news.  PUC "fixed" the language glitches in the original decision granting ETI its certificate and voted it out yesterday.  So we're good to go on filing our final tariff.  It's attached.  Please take a look and let's discuss ASAP (Monday?) so we can get if on file at the CPUC.  Best, Jeff 
 thursday or friday works best for me.     Scott Bolton @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 08/29/2000 10:19 AM 
 It was covered extensively in today's LA Times.    Michael McDonald@ECT 10/06/2000 01:14 PM 
 Will do.    Richard Shapiro 10/06/2000 02:26 PM 
 Chris:  Here are the slides with your suggested edits incorporated.  Take a look. Also, feel free to integrate the portions that you're working on ("deal bench," pre-quals, etc.) directly into the presentation, or I'd be happy to do it.  I'm at 415.782.7822.  I'm contacting Benevides about putting an illustrative slide together representing the base and peak blocks.  Best, Jeff 
 Prentice ever get back to you regarding logistics about tomorrow nite?  What time is dinner by the way. I'm supposed to do something from 3-4, but could come up directly thereafter. 
 Rebecca Smith called.  She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM California.  Topics:  1) How California got here.  2) How California can get out of it.  Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?  I think I've got the messages pretty well down, but might be useful to touch base.  Let me know.  Hear's a message I'm practicing:  "Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the article that I referred to.  Could you please email or fax to me the Commission's decision denying Edison's emergency motion?  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Al Gore 
 yes.    Michael McDonald@ECT 10/06/2000 03:28 PM 
 Well, wouldn't you know it.  I couldn't find the most recent version in my email.  But here's the 10.03 version with a few edits.  Couple of other points:  I still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an attachment. I still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option Rick may be thinking about "Maintain presence with fewer resources."  Think it's something we need to focus on.  Have a great weekend.  Spreadsheet to follow. 
 I confess that I haven't even looked at the bloody thing.  How many questions?  Should we divide them up and pass around as usual?    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 10/06/2000 01:24 PM 
 Heres' the spreadsheet.  I added "regulatory intelligence and expertise" right after the top 5.  Check it out.  Best, Jeff 
 thursday or friday works best for me, but i might be able to make wednesday, too. 
 Understanding there won't be a call on Monday, here's a draft of the auction slides that we've been working on for folks to review. 
 I'm slow, but I catch on eventually.  Steffes was fired up when he called. Sounds like the meeting went pretty well.  Have a good weekend.  Best, Jeff    Richard Shapiro 10/06/2000 10:25 PM 
 Haven't heard of them.  And I'm not aware of any new tariffs that offer those kinds of savings, but we'll check around. 
 Hello?  I guess everyone's wrapped up in the baseball playoffs and the debates.  There are 4 questions.  Since the SF people did 1&2 last time and the East Bay contingent did 3&4, seems we can switch this time.  SF takes 3&4; East Bay 1&2.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  I'm going to read the material and the case today.  Should we compare notes (via email) on questions 3&4 by tomorrow (Sunday) before lunch?  Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 You're the man.  Thanks.  I'll coordinate with Kim and the new recruit.    JcjCal02@aol.com 10/07/2000 11:20 AM 
 I'll get you for this.    JcjCal02@aol.com 10/07/2000 12:11 PM 
 Here's a very rough shot at #'s 3&4.  I think 4's worded very strangely (thus my strange answer).  Anyway, thought I'd throw something together to get the ball rolling.  I'll keep thinking about and send another dispatch later today or first thing tomorrow morning.  Best, Jeff 
 Looks good, Kim.  Thanks. 
 sorry about that. meant to send to tracy (no "e") cooper in Portland, Oregon. 
 Agreed.  I'll handle it.  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 10/08/2000 05:54 PM 
 Looks good.  Thanks.  See you tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  How's things?  Got your message.  Best place to get your hands on the report is the CalPX website.  If you have any problems, let me know. I'll try to write a note discussing our conversation on Friday by end of day.  Best, Jeff 
 Seems that we could provide Lay/Skilling with the power point slides as prep for any calls.  As a starter, it would be useful to provide McNeally with a letter that he could send to federal and state decision makers.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 10/06/2000 06:47 PM 
 Greetings: Any word about whether the PUC bought our proposal? Best, Jeff 
 Strange.  I think that I received an email from someone with the report attached.  Let me scour my emails.  If and when I find it, I'll forward. Disheartening that you can't find a document that's getting so much press. Great website...    Michael Etringer@ECT 10/09/2000 11:09 AM 
 Please let me know if you want me to participate in any gas panels.  And my feelings won't be hurt if you say no.  Worry not.  Just need to know so that I can prepare some materials.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's one that's "final," not draft, that just came out.  I'm assuming that this is the one the press is refering to.  Let me know that you think. 
 Gee, I don't know what came over me.  Apologies.    Richard B Sanders@ECT 10/09/2000 01:02 PM 
 Darlin', the last thing I want is to be rid of you. Get in touch when you can.  And next time you're in town, I'm buying.  Best, Jeff 
 Just spent about 90 minutes with Rebecca.  She left with a very good understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions.  She also spent time asking me how I thought other players would respond to the IOU request for a big check to cover the undercollections.  She expects to have a "big picture" story--covering AB 1890s past, present & future--completed in the next couple of weeks.  In Rebecca's words, she wants the story to "shake things up."  She's very upset with how the utilities are handling it.  I told her we were less concerned with "he said/she said" and more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair to everyone.  Mark and Karen:  In my long history with Rebecca, it has always been understood that our conversations are off the record and background. Invariably, at the end of the conversation, Rebecca tells me that she intends to call later and cajole the daylights out of me in an attempt to use some of my more colorful quotes.  It was no different this time.  If anyone wants more details, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Jimmie's the "compiler" this time.  You're stuff was good.  Whether he has time to incorporate remains to be seen.  But I wouldn't sweat it.  We can talk more tonite about our somewhat "loose" but thus far effective means for getting these things done every week.  Best, Jeff    Christine Piesco <christine.piesco@oracle.com> 10/09/2000 12:45 PM 
 Here you go.  Who's Ugoretz?  Happy Yom.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's Paul's memo with Mona's edits and a couple of my edits.  It's been shipped off to Paul.  I assume he'll be sending it out tomorrow.  If there's any more questions, edits, comments, etc., please give Paul a buzz.  Best, Jeff 
 In the office all week. 
 got it. 
 They've asked me to be on a gas panel.  I've said yes, but hadn't planned at this point on attending any of the conference other than the panel. 
 Bowen called, and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from Texas at the same time, we're on for 9:30 AM.  He'll call back if there's a problem. Also, he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v. AFTS and also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best time to make sure what we file in good ol' CA is consistent with our other filings.  Best, Jeff 
 NARUC's meeting at ground-zero dereg (San Diego) in mid-November, right after the elections.  Might be a good opportunity for a PR event. 
 I can't place him either.    Susan J Mara@EES 10/09/2000 03:34 PM 
 FYI.  Here's what Dave pulled together on Friday.  I talked to him and told him I was going to make a single power point out of the info and then run it by him for review and comment. 
 Shoot.  Love to, but I have a final on Sunday--yes Sunday--the 10th.  Hey, thanks for hanging up on me on Friday. 
 Ms Bennett: Thanks for the voicemail.  Couldn't locate the files you sent in August (uemail now deletes automatically, which may be the problem).  Could you forward a copy to Mr Yang?  Most appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 I've got my car today.  If you need a ride---there, back, or both--just let me know. 
 Check it out. 
 Figures.  I'll see if I can find that needle in that haystack and get back to you. 
 Hi:  I was surprised to see you at the I-House last nite.  Haven't seen you for a while.  Was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was extremely popular and I didn't want to intrude.  This is the first travel-free week I've had in a long time.  You want to try to have lunch?  Or we could meet at a non-I-House place during the break and catch up if you like.  Dying to hear about Montana and your possible new life as a day student.  Did you manage to get away last Thursday?  Best, Jeff 
 Harry:  FYI.  First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by AB 970 is 10.7.  Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office). Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.  URL for the event is included below.  Best, Jeff  http://www.energy.ca.gov/efficiency/ab970/notices/2000-09-29_notice.html    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/10/2000 10:41 AM 
 Mike:  We'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case.  We'd originally agreed to a flat fee of $13, 500 (if memory serves) with a bonus for coming in under the cap.  You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according to my records) for over $25,000.  As you recall, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings and associated briefs.  I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset.  With that in mind, I believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.  However, in light of the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that.  If you'd like to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it.  Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Off what hook?    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/10/2000 11:04 AM 
 Thursday, 9.7, works for me for meeting #1. 
 Seems like information that we'd want to get our hands on, non?

 EBS Update Gov Davis/Skilling Update Meeting w/Sempra Coffee with Rebecca Smith QF support for ENA Miscellaneous    Joseph Alamo 10/10/2000 12:37 PM 
 Are folks available for a call tomorrow at 9 AM to begin preparing for the meeting with Sempra next week? 
 Based on last nite's discussion, here's the coordinator list:  Christine--11.6--Teltronica Dylan--11.13--Nutra Kim--11.1--Agro Feed Jeff--11.27--Global Industries Jimmie--12.4--Daimler-Benz  We also decided that: 1) we'd continue with the SF/East Bay split 2) each group should combine the answers into one document prior to sending to the coordinator for final compilation 3) we'd distribute draft answers to the entire group, since some questions feed off of others 4) we'd get finalized responses to the coordinator no later than 4 PM on Sunday  Let me know if this tracks with others' memories.

 Given that Peace is likely going to try to push legislation to merge the ISO and PX and other nasty things, likely makes sense to listen in on our message development, tactics in addressing the LMP problem.  You think there'd be any problem with that?  If not, could you pass along the call in number?  Thanks, Jeff 
 love one.  thanks. 
 good job.    Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 10/10/2000 03:30 PM 
 Thanks, I'll set up a call. 
 We talked about this in detail with Steve when he was in Houston. Please check with him.  The idea is that there would be the flexibility necessary to do just about anything.  Also, there are problems with the decision that Steve was going to talk with Pulsifer about.  Need to get status of those conversations.My understanding was that, if there's a problem with the decision, perhaps our filing would be pushed a bit past the Tuesday.  We'll need to find that out, too. 
 thanks.  i'll set up the call. 
 where are you?  my phone's been on since you paged me.  i didn't get any tickets.  i love you oodles.  (you slobbery ol' sniffly day student doggie.)    Prentice Sellers <psellers@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 10/10/2000 03:51 PM

 Hi.  Please set up a call for 60 minutes for tomorrow, 10.11.00 for 11 AM CALIFORNIA time and distribute info to the list of folks below.  Thank you very much. 
 Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.  Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities.  But before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles call for a wee bit of polling.  Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses pronto.  If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over.  Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight.  Here are the questions:  Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity?  Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear from other folks.  If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome.  Same goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may influence where we eat).  Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.  Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES and ENA) or confine it to GA? Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA? We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December.  What's your preference.  Is there a day that just won't work?  Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.  Best, Jeff

 Attached is a "plant siting" slide for the next Skilling/Davis meeting.  I developed it from background materials that Dave Parquet pulled together. This version includes Daves' comments.  His comments are in CAPS.  Best, Jeff 
 Now I understand why you were talking to Rubin and Summers.  Sounds like an outstanding hire.  Congratulations.  Exciting changes for exciting times. 
 Greetings:  Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM (PDT).  A Little Background: Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a "festooned" arrangement (i.e., exit sea at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km. At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN. At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP. Will deploy DWDM. Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific systems. In addition to "loops" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF and Monterey. Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial leg). Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego to create a complete loop. Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from Coastal Commission. Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) built and lit by end of Q1 2001. Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey altogether. The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being "clueless" when it comes to marketing the capacity. Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in (per Ethan's emails). They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them. Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.  Best, Jeff 
 position on what? 
 Congratulations one and all.  Very exciting, and well deserved to boot.  Look forward to working with you in your new roles.  Best, Jeff 
 As a follow-up to our call.  Here is some additional information regarding QF pricing issues.  QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full PX prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have switched. The concern is that the Commission's ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices will force the QFs that have switched to "refund" some of the payments they've received (e.g., under a "PX minus" mechanism).  The majority of QFs are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the PUC (except those remotely located QFs who will take a big GMM hit). As we discussed, the Commission strongly rejected Edison's emergency motion regarding the gas piece of the QF pricing formula. Recall also that a couple of months ago

 Bill Reed Sempra's "Chief Regulatory Officer" will replace Gary Cotton on the ISO Board. 
 Wednesday, Dec. 13th would work best for me. 
 FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra. ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.  Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).  Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey Tim:  Calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with Sempra to try to do a gas outsource deal.  We're meeting with the CFO and their Chief Reg Officer next Thursday.  On a call today, we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them, too, while we're there. Laird Dyer's going to call you for indicative prices (same drill we did for Skilling).  If you have any questions, or want me to fill you in more, just give a holler, or check in with Chris.  Best, Jeff 
 plz call asap re: mary hain.  thanks, jeff  415.782.7822 
 Steve:  Here's a word version of the MSA.  Sorry for the delay.  Could you make changes in strike-out-underline format and email back to me when you're done?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff

 Hi.  Hope the ride back to Sacramento went OK last nite.  It was nice to see you and catch up. I'm sorry things are so crazy, but in spite of it all, your attitude's pretty good.  And your new suede jacket is gorgeous.  I know your life is very complicated and I don't want to make it worse, but if you ever have the time and inclination to go to lunch, dinner, movie, whatever, I'd definitely be up for it.  Hang in there.  Hope to catch up again soon.  Best, Jeff 
 I can help, but what's your timing? 
 Jim has mentioned a meeting next week with all of us to talk about strategy, etc. over the next many months.  Might be a good opportunity to clarify how we coordinate on these matters.     "Mary Hain" <Mary.Hain@enron.com> on 08/30/2000 12:43:58 PM

 thanks.  i'll be here. 
 FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the "misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it. Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:  Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government. David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also set up the Governing Boards. 
 I love you, sweetie.  You didn't run out of gas did you?

 DJ PG&E Says Won't Try To Escape Rate Freeze For Now >PCG  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to lift California's state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition to a deregulated market, saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile power prices, senior company officials said Wednesday.  "We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. But that view might change in the future," said a senior company official, who requested anonymity.  PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday to discuss plans for repairing a "not workably competitive power market" and several steps the utility plans to file with federal regulators to do that.  One proposal that is expected to be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price for power would be predetermined based on generation costs. The company wants to temporarily put an end to market-based rates.  The utility will also request that California's independent system operator reduce the wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from $250/MWh.  Company officials said those steps would allow them to recover billions of dollars in unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power prices and protect retail customers.  PG&E said generators would still be able to make a profit on power sold in California with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the state's power supply would be in jeopardy from such an action.  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com

 Hi Kim: Any luck withJackie re: getting together to start the project?  And if there's anything else I can do re: your meeting on Monday, don't hesitate.  Leave me a voicemail and let me know how the meeting goes.  I'll be in Vancouver with the EBS gang Monday/Tuesday, and if all goes well maybe I can chat up some folks while I'm there.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings:  Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed getting together the weekend before for a study session.  I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included folks who ain't even in finance, or if I've left some folks off.

 Great idea.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 10/13/2000 07:19 AM 
 My understanding is that the cap is $2500, but that the PX has filed with FERC to change it ot $350.  My understanding is that FERC has not acted on the request to change it to $350, but I could be wrong.  Dave, Mary, is this your understanding?    Jeannie Mandelker@ECT 10/13/2000 08:03 AM

 I think it would be a good idea to have Ron Carroll in Watkiss' shop to do a parallel analysis to what we're going to have Mike Day do.  Ron's very good and has done much work on these sortrs of issues.  You comfortable with that? 
 My pleasure.  By the way, we're not talking after what the NY baseball teams did to the poor Bay Area teams.  Best, Jeff    Jeannie Mandelker@ECT 10/13/2000 11:00 AM 
 I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, we can make that decision at that time.  One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference. That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult (impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout to get them to back off.    Steven J Kean 10/13/2000 11:06 AM 
 I've been asked for a copy of the transcript from the FERC hearing in S.D. Any chance of getting that?  And do you folks have a copy of the Peace letter (treatise) sent to FERC last week?  If so, could you fax it to 415.782.7854? Many thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Mary.  Did the PUC accept our deal re: information from the subpoena? 
 Monday/Tuesday--Vancouver, BC for EBS meeting Wed--In office Thurs--In office Friday--In office 
 Steve: I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.  May be useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of procurement.  Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.  I'm also going to give you the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for prices at SP15.  Best, Jeff 
 You're in.  Yes, I was thinking of offering up my office.  Also, what do you think about getting together real soon to start setting up the model for our finance paper?  We'll have to do the research, but I think setting the model up will be about 75% of the project.  Best, Jeff    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 10/13/2000 01:09 PM 
 Some documents that Bowen & Co. did on CLEC v. IXC that may still be pertinent. 
 i love you sweetie.  you know it, too.  it's that butterfly place we don't like cuz it's right next door. 
 retest 
 Here are the very indicative prices Tim gave us for 5 year deals at SP15. They'll likely  change by the time we meet with Sempra on Thursday.  25 MW, on peak (6X16):  $53/MWh 25 MW, base load (7X24):  $45/MWh 500 MW, on peak (6X16):  $55/MWh 500 MW, base load (7X24):  $47/MWh 
 My pleasure. 
 Beautiful.  Tuesday it is.  Have a great weekend.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 10/13/2000 02:03 PM 
 Thank you.  Looks like the gov's office would benefit from charm school.    Maureen McVicker 10/13/2000 02:34 PM 
 FYI. 
 thanks, jeremy.  my understanding is that it was sent in today.  i'm supposed to get a copy.  when i do, i'll forward along to you.    Jeremy Meier <jermeier@earthlink.net> 10/13/2000 02:41 PM 
 Got bounced back first time.  Trying again. 
 Prentice tell you we're coming up tonite?  Little spades is in order me thinks.  You? 
 They're still in the formative stage, and the title is korny, but wanted to get the ball rolling.  No pride of authorship.  Feel free to hack away.  Best, Jeff 
 we'll see you gets a whuppin'.  prentice before me.  me about 7:30.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/13/2000 05:12 PM 
 Sounds good.  Given that Sue is going to be back on Tuesday, you may want to coordinate drafting duties with her. 
 That's actually where it came from.  I pulled it from the articles being sent around.  This one was important enough that I wanted to get folks' attention.  have a great weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 drop prentice's car off at shop; go to dome    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 10/13/2000 05:20 PM 
 Attached for your review is a rough cut at slides we're preparing for the meeting with Sempra next Thursday.  Thoughts and comments are appreciated. Please disregard korny title. 
 Thanks.  Didn't get it the first time.  Good comments.  I'm actually in Vancouver today (Monday) and tomorrow.  Let's keep sending back and forth and get together Wednesday morning to finalize.  I'll get a hold of Calger for his comments.    You can leave messages on my voicemail, too.  Best, Jeff    Laird Dyer@ECT 10/16/2000 09:15 AM 
 Will do. Thanks. 
 Good morning professor: Unfortunately, I'm traveling on business today (it's raing in Vancouver) and can't attend class tonite.  I was wondering if you'd be distributing the take home midterm in this evening's class.  Also, could you resend the access code for the Craftmade case?  I believe that I copied it down incorrectly.  Thank you very much.  Best, Jeff 
 OK, lots of folks are interested.  Given that section is on Saturday, I propose 10 AM, this Sunday, at my office (101 California, Suite 1950).  If folks have a real problem with that, let me know.  Also, please RSVP so that I can arrange things with building security.  Best, Jeff    Jeff Dasovich 10/12/2000 08:46 PM 
 Thanks for the dinners, and the breakfast, and the company.  It was fun.  And don't get cranky, but I'm going to be in and out of things this weekend since I have midterms Monday and Tuesday.  Likely means that I'll be studying in Berkeley and SF during the days on Sat and Sun but will be present for the evenings.  H0pe that works.  Kisses, Jeff  PS I'm trying, lord knows I'm trying, to stay out of it, but it's going to start raining up at the Dome very, very soon....... 
 Thank you.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 10/16/2000 03:31 PM 
 In case word hasn't gotten around, ENA learned COB Friday, that it has been chosen to engage in further negotiations with the ISO for about 450 MWs of projects.  The preliminary award is based on ENA's response to the RFQ that the ISO issued last month for "emergency resources." 
 Howdy:  Just between thee and me, I think this note gets to some of the challenges we faced and discussed as part of our "group gropes" over the last several months.  With Sue coming back on Tuesday, and in the spirt of our gropes, it might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead.  May even result in the same outcome on how to proceed, but a little "process" on the front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel.  Anywho, just my two cents.  Hope your meetings in Salem went well.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the info.  Congratz on the deal.

 Yes, I was in Vancouver from last Sunday evening through late yesterday afternoon.  Thank you for checking.    Tresea Parker 10/17/2000 03:47 PM 
 Sure makes sense.  One concern.  If they buy up to 80% of load, do we run the risk of "stranded cost" problem later down the road when we hit the backwardated part of the curve.  Hinges on the term of the contract.  Sort of chicken and egg problem.  If the buy for short terms, the prices will be high, if they buy for longer terms, the prices will be lower, but the risk of stranded cost rises.  Thoughts?    Margaret Carson 10/18/2000 08:33 AM 
 I'm sorry.  Things are so busy that I grabbed an old list that I thought everyone was on.  You are most welcome indeed.  My office (101 Cal, Suite 1950, from 10 am to noon).   Best, Jeff    Carolyn Vavrek <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 10/18/2000 10:06 AM 
 Prentice get in touch?  We're coming on Saturday---i'll likely bet there around 4 or 5.  I'll bring the money then.  In the meantime, can I order a case of coast zin and one of cab for pick up and payment this weekend, too?

 Thanks.  do i need to do anything with the form? 
 FYI. 
 You're a star. Thanks. 
 oops. sunday. 
 thanks a bunch.  just got it.  really appreciate it.  yes, thinking about going on saturday.  and we s.f. folks are getting together for (yet another) review on Sunday from 10 am to noon at my office.  you're welcome to come. 
 Well, you don't have voice mail yet I see.  Could you give me a call when you get a minute (I know that will be tough for the next couple of days) regarding Margo's voice mail to me.   I'd like to talk about one other item as well.  Thanks a bunch. 
 Great.  Thanks Seabron.    Mary Hain@ECT 10/18/2000 05:47 PM 
 Knew you'd be dying to know that Barry Staw will be teaching a class on "Creativity" in the Spring.  Be sure to reserve your place today!  Best, Jeff 
 I just figured it was a way for you to finally track him down---you know, show up at his class and get midevil on his ass for a few minutes....  That is a great solution!  You mean work part time, or go to school part time.  Very selfishly, I'm of course very glad that you're staying in the evening program.  We're actually getting together on Sunday (I hope I didn't mess things up).  Yes, it's for finance, though you're welcome to join---we can use all the help that we can get.  I'm really glad to hear that things are going better.  You seemed in pretty good spirits on Tuesday, though I guess that could have partially been due to the big celebration over getting your first ticket.  Congratulations!  I'll buy you a beer.  I have a feeling that the only reason you haven't gotten one until now is because you've managed to talk your way out of many.  Best, Jeff    Courtney Abernathy <courtney_abernathy@yahoo.com> 10/19/2000 09:11 AM

 FYI.  I didn't receive email yesterday, and I only started receiving them today at 11 AM.  Quesiton:  After Clinton's speech, don't you think the convention is going to cry when they have to sit through Al Gore?  I'm worried----he's so pathetic. 
 Greetings: Wow, lots of fun out there, eh?  Don't know what it will be like without Steve Peace around any more....  I have a very mundane question, though.  What prices for intrastate capacity did the PUC finally come up with in the Sempra BCAP for large generators under the new "Sempra-wide" rate doctrine?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 First apologies if you're getting this and you ain't even in finance---it's a study list from last year.  If it's annoying the heck out of you.  Write back and I'll try to modify the list.  Second, please forward to those you know I've missed.  Just to clarify.  Meet at my office on Sunday from 10 am to Noon.  Please bring specific questions.  We'll go round the room and let folks ask questions and the group will attempt to answer them.  Best Jeff    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 10/16/2000 02:43 PM 
 Excellent.  We've been wondering why we've been excluded from the bob-zine= =20 mailing list. =20  Bob:  Nothing personal but I hope both NY teams lose in the world series.  Best, Jeff 
 Got it.  The sure-fire way to get me is at "jdasovic@enron.com."  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Mary: When Seab completes the draft of his reader-friendly exec summary, could you make sure that Karen gets a copy to review?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 good idea.  epsa, too?    Mary Hain@ECT 10/19/2000 03:19 PM 
 Ok.  Here it is.  Quick and dirty.  Make any changes you like.  You're right, if anyone's going to beat St. Louis, it's going to be KC, but I took St. Louis. 
 like, are you back? 
 Greetings Folks:  Any chance of finalizing the California tariff Monday morning (have a call, say, 7:30/8:00 AM PDT)?  Let me know.  Hope all's well with all.  Best, Jeff 
 Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week? 
 I have the distinct impression that you're glad this has been finalized.... 
 'Thanks a million.  Agree that humor is needed right now, though it's in short supply, so to speak.... 
 Thanks.  Remind me to tell you the story of the time that I was on a panel with him. Yours is the most succint description of him that I've heard to date.  Was curious whether his rant was getting any traction with people that matter.  Sounds like it isn't.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/19/2000 05:36 PM 
 yes.  be happy to talk tomorrow.  just give a holler when you've a minute. thanks. 
 welcome to the assylum, sue and mona.    Joseph Alamo 10/19/2000 06:11 PM

 Lara: I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a deal with them).   That's a date that I can't change.  I can meet on Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange  Best, Jeff    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 07:41 AM 
 Thanks, Mark.  Sounds good.  As it turns out, there is a very slight chance that I might be on the panel in California with Prof. Littlechild.  I'll take you/him up on the offer to get together while he's here.  Best, Jeff    Mark Schroeder@ECT 10/20/2000 04:48 AM 
 Unfortunately, I have to get on a plane and go to LA around that time.  If it works better, we can discuss on Tueday morning/early afternoon.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Sue Nord 10/19/2000 10:30 PM 
 Thanks so much for the gifts.  Very sweet.  Sorry I was rushed, but I've got a big bad finance midterm on Tuesday that I ain't ready for and work's nuts. But I really want to hear more about the trip.  Sounds like it was a blast.  You looked lovely in the pictures, all dressed up a la l'Italienne, and you look lovely in your everyday sweatshirt and jeans, too.  (Don't sweat it.)  Prentice and I were planning on going to the Shea's tonite.  You guys going?  Also, I'd love to talk to you this weekend if possible about Prentice's bday festivities. 
 plz call asap when you get a break re: FERC order yesterday on California. 
 did i, or did i not, already give you mine.  signed, confused. 
 plz call at 415.782.7822. 
 Good idea.  Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D. with Sempra execs.  My apologies.  But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference would be to participate in the "first" meeting.    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 11:14 AM

 You by chance know where the review is tomorrow?  It's from 10 am to 2 pm, right?  Thanks a bunch. 
 Thanks.  See you tomorrow. 
 fyi. 
 Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.  The description of the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.  $100 cap for "old" generation; "new" generation would be exempt. FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of their power. For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100 cap, and the $250 cap will apply. Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward market. Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market will be penalized (details to be "ironed" out).  The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today. 
 No sweat.  Not a problem.  Summary will do fine.  Let's definitely try to coordinate for the next meeting.  You have a great weekend, too.  Best, Jeff    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 04:20 PM 
 Well, it's a start, but it needs work.  See you in LA.  Hey, I just forgot, you haven't sent me the address of where it is I'm going! 
 No need for thanks.  These are busy times.  Take care.    Lara Leibman 10/20/2000 05:43 PM

 Jim:  To say that there was gaming in the UK pool is a significant understatement.  Couple thoughts...I'm pretty sure that Seab has done extensive analysis on the UK and he'd likely therefore be very useful in developing rebuttal. (Though very close to it at one point, I've been removed for a few years.)  Also, Schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some insights, and seems that Schroeder's pretty close now with Littlechild---that might be another avenue for information to rebut.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Lee:  Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have "generating company" rep on the agenda.  Enron does not see itself as a generating company.  In fact, the only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in Southern California.  Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep? Hope that's not a problem.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings All: If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.  Steve Bowen & Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of weeks ago in Houston.  Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review. Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.  Thoughts?  P.S.  Some good news.  Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona (in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.  Well, I've spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.  Best, Jeff 
 My apologies.  I thought we had discussed me being on the first panel.  Thus, my previous note.  I see that I'm on the second, however.  Sorry for the confusion.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, 9:35 would be better.  Thanks for asking.  Best, Jeff    Diane Dimeff <dimeff@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> Sent by: owner-eveningmba@Haas.Berkeley.EDU 10/24/2000 01:26 PM Please respond to Diane Dimeff

 We'll send a card.  She's 19?  Well, if we have to, we'll take some tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too.  Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road while my is doing my road at the end of the month?   He's going to fax me the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.  To be honest, the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this guy is really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.  He's pretty willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to Rolls Royce-style road.  And if you want to take a pass, that's of course great, too.  I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know. 
 what's the number? 
 Steve:  Attached is a memo that reponds to your question:  "Can the solution to the utilities' undecollection problem take place at the PUC, or is a legislative fix required?"  As we discussed, I'm also attaching a memo from Mike Day on the issue.  Bottom line:  It's within the PUC's jurisdiction to solve the problem, but the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the Legislature in the next session.  If you, or anyone on the distribution, have any questions, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for you help, Simon.  And Margaret, as always, thank you very much. 
 Got a call that Loretta Lynch and Rod Wright, among others, spoke at yesterday's annual meeting of regulation lawyers.  The following was very briefly relayed to me:  President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---if you "come knocking on her door, that's a strike against you."  One should participate, along with the rest of the public, through the hearing process.  Rod Wright said that businesses (including Enron) are being frustrated by rules and regs that act as unnecessary impediments. 
 Actually ordering El Paso to do what TW already does, so if anything, affirms TW's operating procedures.  El Paso has been in the cross-hairs of the entire industry.  Interestingly, this suit arose from the lengthy and detailed discussions we all had as part of the settlement---as you can imagine, El Paso saw it as a negative outcome of those talks.  We can discuss further when I'm in Houston tomorrow and Friday.  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 10/25/2000 09:40 AM

 FYI:  Got a call from a colleague who told me that Loretta Lynch and Rod Wright, among others, spoke at yesterday's annual meeting of regulation lawyers.  The following sums up what was very briefly relayed to me about Pres. Lynch's and Rod Wright's remarks:  President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---"If you come knocking on my door, that's a strike against you.  One should participate, along with the rest of the public, through the hearing process."  Rod Wright sounded a more positive tone, stating that businesses (including Enron) are being frustrated by rules and regs that act as unnecessary impediments to plant development.  He made the point that the rules and regs need to be made more rationale and streamlined.  Apparently, he's still clinging to the idea of the State getting in to the power plant development business by signing contracts with providers.

 So it is the 2nd after all?  Thought it might be the first, which I could have made.  The 2nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ENA to meet with Sempra execs to see if a deal can be done (yeah, right).  But since it's that early on the 2nd, I can call in by conference call and attend the first 90 minutes, or so.  Will that work?  In other exciting news, going to meet with the lawyers and Bowen either this afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow.  You want to join?  And should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend?  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff    Sue Nord 10/25/2000 02:15 PM

 You're in luck!  The meeting's from noon to 1 pm CST, so you can attend.  Do you feel lucky?  Would you like to participate---the option's yours.  I'll invite Scott, too.  If you'd like to attend, should we call you from the conference room?  Best, Jeff    Sue Nord 10/26/2000 01:23 PM 
 Chris: Here it is.  Sorry about the delay.  Had to track down the final.  Best, Jeff 
 if you want to talk, page me at 888.916.7184.  i'll call you back.  i'm in houston.  kisses,jeff 
 nope.  here today.  back tonite.  you can page me at 888.916.7184.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 10/26/2000 06:39 PM 
 Yes, please forward along.  Kathleen and Thom, Don Schultz is, and has been for about two decades, a rather earnest and tenacious crusader for DSM.  Very detail-oriented sort of fellow.  Works for the California Commission's "Division of Ratepayer Advocates."  Just a heads up.  Best, Jeff 
 I don't know, though I don't think so.    Karen Denne 10/26/2000 10:37 PM 
 I'm throwing together some messages points.  I'll forward to you for slashing. 
 Thank you.  If you'r open tomorrow (Sunday), I'll call you then.  Best, Jeff Dasovich    "Chris Harrington" <postmaster@oceanicrealty.com> 10/27/2000 03:12 PM 
 FYI.  Seems like we've given the Governor quite a bit up to this point, but there may be some good reasons to, as they say, keep on giving.  Perhaps we can discuss further as part of our meeting on Monday.  Best, Jeff    "Katie Kaplan" <kaplan@iepa.com> 10/27/2000 06:20 PM Please respond to kaplan 
 Congratulations.  Everyone is extremely pleased that you're joining.  Best of luck and very much looking forward to working together.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll believe it when I see it.  Seems like a good idea to keep the heat on Hoecker & Co.right up until Nov. 1. 
 Thanks.  I'm glad they want to follow-up with Steve (I've been pushing it) and I've got some follow-up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post-call.  Let's regroup on Monday.  I'll be in Portland but can call you.  Best, Jeff    Jeremy Meier <jermeier@earthlink.net> 10/29/2000 11:48 AM 
 Attached for your review are draft talking points for the Cal Energy Markets conference I'm speaking at on Thursday in SF.  All comments, suggestions, etc. are appreciated.  Thanks. 
 Yes, I would like to participate. Thanks. 
 thanks a million.  talk to you then.    Lara Leibman@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/31/2000 03:48 PM 
 Greetings Dr. Gobbo:  If my memory serves, you should have arrived back in Italy, or will return soon.  Since we met, I have spoken with Severin Borenstein, who is intimately involved with California's electricity restructuring (melodrama?) and a renowned energy economist  at UC Berkeley.  Severin has offered to serve as a contact for you as you continue to take on the formidable task of restructuring your country's electric industry.  I've included his contact information below.  And, of course, if there is ever anything I can do for you, do not hesitate to contact me.  All the best, Jeff  Severin Borenstein  E.T. Grether Professor of Business Administration and Public Policy   Director Haas School of Business              U.C. Energy Institute University of California             2539 Channing Way Berkeley, CA 94720-1900              Berkeley, CA 94720-5180 (p) 510-642-3689                     (p) 510-642-5145 (f) 707-885-2508                     http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei  Email: borenste@haas.berkeley.edu WWW: http://haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste 
 Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.  Have distributed to Western GA team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.  Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."  Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.  The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.  Comments are much appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Chris:  As we discussed yesterday, Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday.  We'll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S.D. last week.  You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product.  You still considering it?  Let us know and we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.  My flight gets into S.D. at at 8:35 on southwest.  Best, Jeff 
 Sandi sez it's actually happening at 10 AM and it's renewable-focused. 
 Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've misconstrued anything.  Thanks.  FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result. In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a fundamental step in the right direction. However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility in California.  As structured, it will: discourage the development of new generation to serve California fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness. force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California. We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap proposal. We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers. 
 with "much" of what i said?    James D Steffes 11/01/2000 01:39 PM 
 Got calls in to Richard at PG&E and Reed at Sempra.  Will report back.    James D Steffes 11/01/2000 01:28 PM 
 anything you want, honey.  I love you.    Prentice Sellers <psellers@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 11/01/2000 03:15 PM 
 Lord help us.  Call whenever you'd like to discuss the call (that Palmer forgot to tell you about).    David Parquet@ECT 11/01/2000 03:24 PM 
 Thank you.    Mark Palmer 11/01/2000 03:42 PM 
 That's fine if you don't want to do the road, but please tell Eldon and I'll tell Jeff (my road guy). 
 Mark Palmer 11/01/2000 03:42 PM 
 My bet is that Pat will be at NARUC.  I think that Michael Moore, PhD Economist and CEC commissioner would be very good (I tried Bilas--he's got a conflict) and don't think it's a problem that he and Larson are both on because they'll come with two quite different takes.  P.S. FERC dropped a bomb on California today. 
 Apologies.  I'm in S.D. with Calger and Dyer to meet w/Sempra tomorrow morning.    Joseph Alamo 11/01/2000 05:12 PM 
 Will do, thanks.  See you at the Alaska gate.    Christopher F Calger@ECT 11/01/2000 06:02 PM 
 Thanks.  FYI--I'll be participating on the second panel.  Best, Jeff 
 Gee, sounds great.  Can't wait. Congratz on keeping the sky from falling out there.  Best, Jeff    Joe Hartsoe 11/01/2000 05:49 PM 
 Just got back from Sacramento.  Davis still pandering... 
 Nope, not at this point.  Rather than start with money, we'd rather start with getting the rules (i.e., the IOUs) fixed so that there ain't regulatoy roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment.  Sound reasonable? 
 thanks.  let's discuss further.    "Cherry, Brian" <BKC7@pge.com> 11/01/2000 04:46 PM 
 Wanted to make sure that you knew that today FERC declared the cap that the ISO Board voted out last week "null and void," which means that we're back to the old $250 cap.  FERC proposed a "soft" $150 cap that would take effect in 60 days, however.  Call if you have questions.  Best, Jeff 
 My schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling.  Possible to meet this weekend to discuss the project?  Either day's fine with me.  Apologies for the last minute change.  Best, Jeff 
 Is there a suggested time for the meeting?  I'm pretty open.  I'd like to be sure that Jim and Paul and Mary Karen Denne can participate, too.  Do we need to have other commercial folks on the call (e.g., Calger, Belden, someone from EES (Yang and/or Benevides)?    Joseph Alamo 11/03/2000 12:06 PM 
 are you and scott available this weekend to look at the place i'm thinking about renting in stinson for prentice's birthday? 
 thank you very much. 
 Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered on an IEP call today:  The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes. Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on board. Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting. The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous "prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts. Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting. Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do worse, they take the hit.  The utility, under this framework, has broad flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.  (FYI: Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a panel discussion that I participated in yesterday at the California Energy Markets conference.) The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the expertise, to get back into the generation business. 
 I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address. apologies.  i'm losing it.  did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?  If not, do you want to meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?  i'm in town.  just let me know. i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy (flaky) to search it out.  best, Jeff 
 great.  you going to the game?    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/03/2000 01:36 PM 
 that sounds good.  what if it's saturday?  is there a time you could go? (why so much interest in the niner game?    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/03/2000 03:13 PM 
 FYI. 
 11 am it is on saturday.  yes i'm going to see kathy cowlick. 
 Of course, I will be hurt and disappointed if the Sellers family doesn't vote its conscious, doesn't vote for the candidate that truly represents the values that the Sellers family stands for.  That candidate is, of course, Ralph Nadar.  Amen, Jeff  P.S. Rory and Timi love Dr. Laura.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/03/2000 05:07 PM 
 just got a call from the realtor.  they expect us at 11 am at their office in S.B. tomorrow.  lalime's (sp?)  is cool.  ask prentice about it.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/03/2000 04:52 PM 
 don't change the subject.  vote your concious.  gore voted for scalia AND thomas.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/03/2000 05:13 PM 
 one down, four to go.....  god bless scott.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/03/2000 05:42 PM 
 OK.  Looks like Saturday's out.  I'm game for tomorrow.  Morning? Afternoon?  We can meet at my office if you'd like, or at a cafe.  Let me know.  Best, Jeff    Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 11/03/2000 07:26 PM 
 FYI.  My understanding is that Martin and Doug are going to be focused on DG in California.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 11/04/2000 09:53 AM 
 Yes.  You can expect it this weekend.  My apologies for being tardy.  Also, I think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.  I can make a contact and I don't think that it's too late to try.  He'd be very good.  Very close to the governor.    Heather Cameron <hcameron@uclink.berkeley.edu> 11/04/2000 03:54 PM 
 call me unreasonable.  i can take it.  been called worse, though, of course, coming from you, it hurts more. 
 FYI.  We'll get a call in number first think Monday morning.  Paul, do you want to notify Calger, Belden and Thomas in Portland? 
 FYI.  How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the table for some time.  I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to the current framework.  As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy Market conference last week.  The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other options--with him.  My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the Wright meeting last week.  With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.  It might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Harry:  Seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that EES is in the loop.  Assemblyman Rod Wright's trying to find a solution that the whole industry can embrace, which he'd then foist on the Governor.  Sandi, Parquet and Day attended the first meeting last week.  I'll forward to you Parquet's notes from the meeting.  We'll be setting up a call in number first thing Monday morning.  Best, Jeff 
 Congratulations Kathleen and Peter.  This ought to make this week's ARM=20 meeting, well, sort of interesting.=20  Viva New Power!  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is. 
 Given the emphasis from all quarters on the need for retail competition to make California work, would seem useful to strike a balance between the degree to which the comments emphasize wholesale and retail reforms.  And for the record, Sue, no I don't talk like that.  Best, Jeff    Susan J Mara 11/02/2000 03:50 PM 
 Mike:  Call Paul and/or Mona about energy attorneys in Arizona.  (Paul: 503.464.7945.)  Don't give any good talent to our competitors!  Best, Jeff 
 The call-in number for the 12:30 (PST)/2:30 (CST) phone call is:  dial in: 888.476.6127 code: 125995  Thanks, Jeff 
 I don't  we're ready.  could call at some point so we can discuss? 415.782.7822. 
 Reminder we have a call at 3 PM PST/5 PM CST re: CLEC/Tariff in CA/Authority to dig in CA.  We'll use the internal bridge, which I believe is: 888.311.9051 and the code is 60396.  Best, Jeff 
 Have a great time in Nashville.  Don't forget to vote.  Gray gonna be there? 
 We can uninvite steffes, hain, denne, kingerski, comnes if having them on presents any problems.  I hadn't included Marcie on the call, but would be happy to include her, too.  just let me know. 
 Mary: Please include me in the call with Mr. Sanders & Co.  Best, Jeff 
 Ditto.  Sounds good.  Talk to you tonite.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/06/2000 12:58 PM 
 FYI.  I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next Monday on the Berkeley campus.  It's being sponsored by the Policy School and some folks from the Business School.  Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck (Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.  Alums who now work in the energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American Public Power Ass.)  We're providing a modest stipend.  There are two "round tables."  First one is "Why did we do this?," and the second one is "Where to from here?"  I'll be on the second panel.  Go to the attached website for agenda and other info.  I intend to pull from the messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of the last several weeks/months.  I'll distribute talking points for review and comment sometime this week.  But please feel free to send thoughts, suggestions, etc. early and often.  Best, Jeff  http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm. 
 Dear Colleagues,  The draft website is ready to go public. It has been linked to the gspp website. It is still the same address: http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  Talk to you all soon. Best wishes, Heather 
 i'm calling marcie as we speak.    Paul Kaufman@ECT 11/06/2000 02:02 PM 
 FYI:  Sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re: launching missiles over email to the world.  I told her that 1) folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that gets to commercial folks, 2) she should continue sending those notes out and 3) she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to GA, which gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push out to commercial folks, and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an (unintentional and  unnecessary) frenzy.  I think she took it well and I think she'll make a practice.  Only time will tell. 
 Alpert has passed both Assembly and Senate--on way to Governor.  6.5 cent cap.  Am faxing in case you don't have.  Jeff 
 Congratulations.    Joseph Alamo 11/06/2000 03:02 PM 
 Is this something they've said publicly?  If so, have they provided any rationale?  Thanks.    Mary Hain@ECT 11/06/2000 02:36 PM 
 thank you.  if you get a chance, give a jingle and give me the brief rundown on where we left off on part 1.  thanks. 
 Gee, and at $120/bottle, I can load up on a few cases.  At that price, the Mondavi's must be hoping Bush wins so America can spend the tax break on that tasty Reserve.  (Kidding!)  Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve, too?  GO RALPH!      Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/06/2000 01:01 PM 
 another ugly stereotype that is still alive and well in america.  I am so hurt, nancy.  so hurt.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/06/2000 04:52 PM 
 Greetings Wayne:  Sorry that I missed the last meeting.  I'll be attending by phone this week, but would like to attend in person as often as I can (understanding that our meetings will be weekly).  Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.  That way I could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't permit me to do on Wednesdays).  If it's too complicated, don't sweat it; I can continue to do the meetings by phone.  But if Thursdays can fit into folks' schedule, that would be great.  Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.  Best, Jeff 
 Have you drafted any talking points yet?  I'm working on what I'll focus on for the conference at Berkeley next Monday and would love to crib from your comments.  Best, Jeff    Sarah Novosel 11/06/2000 04:58 PM 
 and do you get the discount for the 97 Reserve? 
 I've tried to capture in the document Dave sent around on Friday, the preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting.  If I've mangled or missed anything, please chime in.  If folks have information (i.e., bullet points) to discuss at Wednesday's meeting regarding the various issue areas they're thinking about, please foward along to me by COB tomorrow and I'll compile for distribution first thing Wednesday morning.  Best, Jeff 
 SF all week.    Joseph Alamo 11/06/2000 07:55 PM 
 Do you mind if I meet with Carl and Severin and Rich next time I'm over at Haas to discuss this a bit with them? 
 go right ahead and choose me as a reviewer. 
 Wayne:  If you insist, we can pass on Thanksgiving.  Others:  Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?  If the meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis, I'd like to try to attend in person as much as possible (i.e., schedule permitting).  Currently, my schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.  But Thursdays would work.  If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.  Best, Jeff    Wayne Gardner@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/06/2000 06:08 PM 
 You're welcome. 
 Question:  re: "cat herding."  Do we have the participants list yet?  I've got a call in to Smutney (IEP)---Sue talked to him about the cap yesterday and I'm piling on today.  If we can give Smutney an alternative to "the $150 cap's OK," then we can likely persuade him.  Tim: Be useful to know as soon as possible if the alternative Steve suggests below (i.e., >$150 bids with no disclosure) is palatable.  If other specific CA generators are participating on the panel, we'll need to know who they are in order to "assist" them with their price cap-related comments.  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 11/07/2000 08:59 AM 
 Dave and I talked.  I've talked to Chris Foster (midmarket in Portland). He's sending me 1) illustrative examples of offers we've made to each of the three IOUs, 2) deals we've done with the IOUs to date (only one thus far with PG&E).  Laird Dyer will get back to me with the muni deals we've thus far done (e.g., Roseville.)  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 11/07/2000 08:59 AM 
 Hi.  My palm for some reason isn't syncing.  Could you have Chris give me a call to try to get it to work?  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff  415.782.7822 
 Thanks.  I can be on the call.  One other thing.  If there's anything you need me to do re: Bowen's bill for services, don't hesitate to let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 de nada 
 Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.  In true "swedish hostage syndrome" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the "industry" is under siege and that "just saying no" to price caps isn't politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head of California's generator association to avoid the topic.  We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal and offered the following message points:  Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again. FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether. The most important reforms include: Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to undermine "high" prices is easy entry by competitors Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works. The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" reviews of power purchases. Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish. FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed. Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, efficient markets require peakers. Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary. Disincents energy efficiency. IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap.  Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm sorry, I'm losing my mind.  did you send Amber's address?  if so, i've deleted it. could you send again?  also, are you sure you don't want the tickets?  they come with free parking (it ain't the closest lot, but hey, it saves 20$).  also, please let me know when you've confirmed with the G.O. that you don't want to do road, so that I can tell Jeff.  And of course we'll pick up the football forms, just make sure they're somewhere easy to find (butcher block table?).  we'll be coming up tomorrow evening to pick up all the stuff.  how's the canopy?  you and eldon playing ping pong? 
 Thanks a million.  Will keep you in the loop on what's going on between now and Thursday.  And don't hesitate if you need anything, or if there's anything that you want to add to the stew.    Chris H Foster@ECT 11/07/2000 01:07 PM 
 plz call asap re: dow reporter called to talk ISO peakers.  thx, jeff 415.782.7822 
 plz chk email re: conversation w/smutney on price caps.  best, Jeff 
 To help herd cats, might be useful to get to the generators via multiple contact points.  My understanding is that the Houston-to-Houston contacts are good ones. We'll continue to work it via IEP and generator contacts here in California.

 Steve:  I'm not sure how far along you are with the comments, but California's insistence on micro-managing utility purchases is really standing in the way of developing a competitive, functional market.  The prospect of having Ms. Lynch in particular and the State of California generally as a counter party in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact. (Though the situation in California has now put the utilities into a "damn the torpedoes" mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory risk.)  Clearly, the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function.  But given the political climate in California, we're likely to have the utility in the role of buyer, at least in the near term.  For the market to work in a structure with utility as buyer, the CPUC and California need to get out of the way. Otherwise, it's a never-ending quagmire.  A couple of PUCs ago, the CPUC set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas procurement.  Under that mechanism, a benchmark is set.  If the utility beats the benchmark, it shares the benefits with consumers.  If it does worse than the benchmark, it shares the pain with consumers.  It's a model that works, that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets.  It ain't perfect, but it's head and shoulders above the regulator-as-counterparty that the current PUC has put in place.  Given the brief time you'll have, there may be other more critical issues, but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy.

 Hey, I know it's a pain, but I think there would be value in getting together (if folks are available) on Thursday evening from 7-10 with (lots of) beer and pizza and grind through the finance case.  We can do it at my apartment, or anywhere else you folks would like to do it.  Thoughts? 
 god bless you. 
 Here's a start.  Try 'em out for size.  More to follow.  Best, Jeff  Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again. FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether. The most important reforms include: Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to undermine "high" prices is easy entry by competitors Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works. The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" reviews of power purchases. Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish. FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed. Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, efficient markets require peakers. Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary. Disincents energy efficiency. IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap.

 How can I get info on deals we've done to you?  Jeff 
 Great.  Glad to hear it.  Did you get my voice mail?  Makes sense for you to go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal.  I've talked to folks internally (and will discuss further with them tomorrow and Friday when I'm in Houston).  I'd like you to keep the information confidential, but I'm fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of the project will be.

 Hey:  we meeting tonite?  can you BELIEVE this bloody election?    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/07/2000 04:28 PM 
 Steve:  Here are the deals and offers.  The desk is concerned about two things:  1) that we not make the specific of the deals/offers public.  They're fine with general statements like "the offers are below the price cap."  2) they have good relationships with the IOUs and the munis and are starting to do a lot of deal; as such, they expressed concern about any comments that might agitate them and make them disinclined to transact with us (sound familiar)?  If there's anything else you need, for if you have any questions about this material.  Don't hesitate.  Good luck.  Best, Jeff 
 Talked to Bill Reed.  In his comments, he will say:  FERC should be more prescriptive.  Can't wait for a new board, made of new people, to act.  FERC needs to be more assertive--I told him we're all for leadership from FERC. They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him we'd have a similar message on that issue. FERC should "PJM" the California market--I told him we would differ significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and "merging" the PX and the ISO. He said his comments on "refunds" would be "narrow" and would point out that the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific "bad actors" and that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking. I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner. He said that it sounds like a good idea. I told him about our message on price caps.  He said that he would stress that price caps ought to be a temporary "fix," and should be removed just as soon as the market is "functional."  Steve: I told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel tomorrow and talk more.  Best, Jeff  Best, Jeff

 OK, here's the list:  Mondavi's always a classic, and up the hill is La Famiglia (Mondavi brand that's a sweet view, great place to have a picnic lunch, and it has some neat brique-braque. Hess collection. Sterling. Jarvis--truly amazing (and ostentatious--wait till Beth sees the woman's restroom!) But you must call NOW to try to get in. Cordonui (sparkling wine) also has a very lovely view. Stag's Leap. Up valley (Calistoga way) is Chateau Montellana (sp?), which has really wonderful wine. Finally, if you would like, I might be able to tap into a connection and get you in at Opus (Mondavi--maybe one of the best wines, dare I say, anywhere). Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus, and I'll get on it pronto.  And if you want to do Jarvis, call now!   Hess Collection.  Opus.  Sterling.  Mondavi.  Jarvis (if you can get in). 
 Greetings Folks:  As you know, the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PG&E's trying to figure out where to go from here.  I would argue that what happens with PG&E is equally, if not more, important as what happens with SoCal.  As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts, longs for the "halcyon days" of command-and-control regulation.  As such, I think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.  In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed experts.  I think we should employ that approach again.  I asked Mike Day, who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.  Mike's proposal is attached.  Finally, if there's anyone else you think we ought to include in our coalition, please let me know.  Let me know what you think.  Hope all is well with you and yours.  Best, Jeff  ***************************************************************************      Jeff:  Goodin, MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements.  We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition.  In exchange for joining the coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information.  I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc. However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead partner on the case.  I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case.  Because the majority of this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly fees.  However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition, and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all participants in the coalition.  With this discount, these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.  I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be.  Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates.  If you require some type of estimation sooner than that, please let me know.  Thank you for your interest in using our services.

 Hi.  Nice to see you in Houston.  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points you circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the talk?  Finally, rest assured, you're the best resource anyone could hope for on gas issues anywhere in Enron.  If it seems like I've bugged you less recently it's because 1) I feel like I've bugged you a lot--too much--over the past couple of years and don't want to wear out my welcome and 2) with the electricity crisis in California and the start-up of Broadband, my attention has been less focused on gas.  Though that will change soon, since as you may have heard, PG&E's "Gas Accord" is coming to an end and we've got to figure out where to go from here.  (You'll be hearing from me in the near future on that issue, since I'll need to get a company-wide view of what we want to happen out here in the West.)  Look forward to seeing you again real soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  How you feeling these days?  From whom can I get copies of the following presentations?  2000 RB-NGC-0800-2 2000 JN-2080039-4  Thanks a billion.

 Thanks.  FYI:  I won't need accomodations.  I'll only be there for the day on Tuesday.

 Greetings Ms Carson:  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points that Shelly Corman circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the talk?  And are there any recent analyses by CERA, PIRA etc. about gas nationally, in the West, and in California that you could forward.  And if you get a chance, could you give a ring?  I've got a couple of questions.  As always, greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 gracias, jose. 
 I assume, since C1's stock rose 10 points yesterday, that you struck a deal with them! 
 you @ ferc?  if so, give kahn my best, and tell him we look forward to the flood of plants he'll approve next week.  peace will never change.  Jeff 
 you hearing this horseshit?  jeff

 Hi Ginger:  Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on Monday.  I'll be participating in the conference.  Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless)  "UC Regents" and send it to:  Heather Cameron Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy University of California 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA  94720   The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is:  946002123.  Thanks very much.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 So far, all is well.  Thanks for asking.  Best, Jeff 
 Mark: Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation.  Perhaps the administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a "placeholder" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to "fix" the mess that California refers to as a "market."  As such, there hasn't been much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control regulation.  However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports, which I'll forward in a seperate email.  I look forward to seeing Prof. Littlechild at the conference on Monday.  He's on the first panel, I'm on the second.  I've attached the URL for info on the conference.   http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  December 2000 HEADLINE: "Perfection in California" AUTHOR: Wilfred Wong SUMMARY: Recommended: 1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130) 
 darling.  please.  don't taunt me.  i'm now too flustered for words.  got your page and voicemail.  been wrapped up ALL day.  i'll try to call later.  give me your number again, please.    Colleen Silva <Csilva@redsky.com> 11/09/2000 03:34 PM

 FYI. 
 OK, the tours are booked (it ain't much anyway).  But you're on the guest list for a complimentary OPUS tasting (see previous note).  OPUS is across the street from and just south of the main Mondavi winery.  When you get there, check in with the concierge, who will have your name and will set up with the complimentary tasting.  It gets real crowded sometimes, which causes them to close the gates.  If that occurs, you simply need to buzz the intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up.  You should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a cool place.  Finally, they're open from 10:30-3:30.  Later it gets, crazier it gets.  I suggest you try to get there around 11:30, which will ensure that you get the attention you deserve.  Have a great time.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings. I really encourage you folks to be in close contact with Robbi and company.  Please keep me tightly in the loop about any conversations, activities, etc.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Hopefully you mean "buy?" 
 John:  I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting. Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.  I apologize---you may have read in the papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.  It's taking up a considerable amount of my time these days.  I would be happy to reschedule for next week.  Wed-Fri.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 John:  We must thinking alike.  I just sent you a note.  I apologize, but I need to reschedule.  Monday and Tuesday of next week don't work, but Wed. thru Thurs. do.  Just let me know what works for you.  Again, my apologies, and I look forward to meeting next week.  Best, Jeff

 Greetings:  Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC hearing that took place today.  We've been invited to attend.  Focus of hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather than FERC's.  Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.  Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California? Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee? ("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell group of people.")  If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST). Please let me know if this works for folks.  And if it does work, Ginger could you set up a call-in number?  Best, Jeff 
 This schedule is correct. 
 you're very welcome. 
 Greetings Diane:  Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying!  In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the head, I just wanted to say it's been great working with  you guys. Unbelievable....   In any case, congratulations.  Sounds like, all in all, it was a good meeting.   Scott:  has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet? 
 Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody.  Amen. 
 You have access to generation daily?  Just wondering if the guy wrote the story...

 Thank you for the note.  I'm very much looking forward to meeting you, and hope that you can visit the office while your hear to discuss California. How long will you be visiting?  Best, Jeff    "Stephen Littlechild" <littlechild@tanworth.mercianet.co.uk> 11/10/2000 12:27 PM

 thank you very much.  i left a message on her voicemail.  that oughta do for now. 
 Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday. If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL: http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"  I've been asked to identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).  There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10 meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the "facilitator."  All comments are appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 You coming diving with me and Shea tomorrow?  You gotta do it, man. 
 i don't know the exact address.  it's between 15th and 16th, same side as the mission. 
 oh boy, you opened the flood gates on this one, missie.    "Brian J. Johnson" <johnsonb@stanford.edu> 11/10/2000 01:15 PM 
 Sell. 
 Tim:  I think this is Rob's new email address.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey folks: Here's my rough cut at question #'s 1-4.  Let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Lately, my email's been mangling addresses when I reply.  Just noticed that I got alot of "couldn't send/big error" messages from the answers I emailed out late last nite.  Did anyone get them?  I'm trying again.  Please let me know if you get this one.  Thanks, and sorry about the mixup.  Best, Jeff 
 That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her. In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll look into setting up a meeting with her.  Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the "undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move ahead.  Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control Peace at her hearings.

 Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be there in person.   Thoughts?  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 11/13/2000 08:16 AM 
 Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing something, please let me know.  Thoughts?    Harry Kingerski 11/13/2000 08:45 AM 
 plz call. re: phil harris of PJM is on my panel today.  want to discuss. 415.782.7822.  thx, jeff 
 Keep in mind that there will be 3 Davis appointees come the first of the year.  Right now the Wilson, Republican commissioners, still hold a 3-2 majority on the Commission.    Mona L Petrochko 11/13/2000 11:40 AM 
 My apologies.  Thank you very much.  Best, Jeff    Diane Dimeff <dimeff@Haas.Berkeley.EDU> 11/13/2000 12:14 PM 
 We said no. 
 sunday. 
 If Karen thinks it would be useful to have the PR firm go and report back, that's how we'll handle it.  Otherwise, we'll get reports from others.  Other commitments win out over FERC's "open mike."    Susan J Mara 11/13/2000 12:28 PM 
 Welcome Chris.  I can meet during the break. 
 Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday. Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far as to push the "core/noncore" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:  I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act as a "quasi-governmental" body offering reliable, low cost service to small customers. I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive market willy nilly. People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of the "good" power, leaving the "dregs" for small customers.  While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening that we should try to exploit.  In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the utility live or die by the benchmark.  There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the Legislature will get on board.

 Can we try Friday at 10 am, again?    John Protzel <John.Protzel@Cambira.com> 11/13/2000 05:58 PM 
 As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to. Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 11/13/2000 04:57 PM 
 Sorry that I've been incommunicado.  At the UC Berkeley conference yesterday, and on my way to an AB 1890 meeting to present on gas in about 5 minutes. Got your message re: PR firm.  Sounds good.  When I'm back in tomorrow, I'll fill you in on yesterday's conference and today's meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Dub and I are going to go to Stinson/Bolinas to seela the deal on Saturday morning/afternoon prior to going to Napa for Nancy's Bday on Sat night. Would love to have you two join, but worry not if you've got conflicts.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Sorry to bother you with this, but I'm travelling, and if you could leave the call-in number for tomorrow's meeting on my voice mail, I'll be forever indebted.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you very much for the summary. 
 Man, Illinois is tough.  One has to submit testimony to get certified!  How are things going?  Got your voice mail.  Hope all's well.  Recovered yet from the conventions? 
 call in number? 
 Glad to hear you're coming.  I'll be sure to wear the lime green shirt....  Best, Jeff    Richard Shapiro 11/14/2000 07:34 PM 
 See you then. 
 B.O. Sorry, I was out of the office all day.  Hope you got there.    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 11/14/2000 02:38 PM 
 I don't have any number.  You need to just drop by there and buzz the manager.  Try from 8-5, when someone's usually there.  Sorry, babe.    Colleen Silva <Csilva@redsky.com> 11/14/2000 03:41 PM

And thanks so much for your help.  If there's anything else that you need, please don't hestitate to let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Love to join.  Thanks. 
 FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed electricity model created by AB 1980.
