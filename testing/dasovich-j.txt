to sign or veto bills. That was not entirely correct. That deadline applies only to so-called "regular session" bills. The bill in question (SB18XX--Burton) was passed as part of the Legislature's "emergency," or "special," session. Apparently, "emergency session" bills do not fall under the October 15th deadline. Davis has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill, though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides. We'll report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the "emergency" session. Bottom line: Today's deadline for regular session bills does not apply to SB18xx, or to other emergency session bills.  Best, Jeff 
 It's safer there. 
 Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.  Best, Jeff 
 Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.  Best, Jeff 
 Were you on call this morning?  It was pretty interesting.  If you weren't on, I'd like to discuss a couple of topics that came up.  Best, Jeff 
 That's fine.  Not critical.  Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 No problem. 
 Greetings Ms Ryall:  Wondering if you ever managed to get a hold of Ms Doll.  No rush, no panic.  Just want to keep the ball rolling.  Thanks again for all your help.  Best, Jeff 
 It was really fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.  It was great to get to play together.  I'll get Scott a check for our share of the goodies.  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff 
  Greetings: Could I get an electronic copy of your request to the CPUC to extend Gas Accord until 2005?  You think they'll approve?  When are comments due?  We want to support you.  Best, Jeff 
 Yeah.  Ask me how happy I am to be back at work, with a midterm in finance tomorrow nite. Sigh...  Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.  I'm sure you were glad just to get home and relax. 
 Sounds good.  No rush, though.  If she's not in till the 22nd, we have some time to plan.  Best, Jeff 
 John Wayne at his spookiest.  4 stars. 
 FYI.  Update on windfall profits bills. 
 This work for you?  Lemme know.  Best, Jeff 
 On another "food for thought" note.  Eldon and Nancy:  Here's the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on "just wars."  Sort of thought-provoking.  Best, Jeff  October 11, 2001 Commentary Even Pacifists Must Support This War  By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."  Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.  Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.  I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months. But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.  It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.  Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.  This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.  In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."  Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.  In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.  And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?  Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.  But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent. Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them. 
 Wait.  You mean that the first time you've seen John Wayne in a movie, or John Wayne being spooky? 
 u aware of whalley meeting this pm re: settle SCE claims?  jeff 
 rent "true grit."  very cool. I highly recommend--from a great coming-of-age girl's novel.  also try "wake of the red witch."  and, of course, "stagecoach." 
 FYI.  Some interesting tid-bits from CMTA. 
 tribolet didn't know about it.  might just be the "small" whalley group. I'll chk back with calger tomorrow am to see.  jeff 
 I'm still in for golf if you are.  I'll bring some knitting in case you decide to bail... 
 Talked at length with Mark Baldwin today.  Could you give me a call when you get a chance to discuss?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff  415.782.7822 
 hey LOL: please tell leeeen that you're faxing it.  thanks.  AY 
 Hi Jane:  I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.  Best, Jeff 
 Burbank's the ticket.  Can you get there direct?  If not, let's do LAX, but Burbank is preferrable.  Less of a zoo.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Glen: Two things.  1) If you'd like me to join in on the call on Wednesday to determine what TW should do regarding the re-surfacing of the SoCal settlement, I'd be happy to join.  Just let me know.  2) Are you going to the SoCal "no more windows" meeting on Thursday?  I'd planned to go but it looks like I might have a conflict now.  I'd like to get a copy of anything they hand out at the meeting.  And if anyone provides any summaries, that would also be useful.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  If you don't, know sweat.  Best, Jeff 
   Hi Evie:  Two quick things:  1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?  2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.  Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks. 
 check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)  Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.  Best, Jeff 
 Forgive me.  Can't recall if I already responded. Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.  Best, Jef 
 Thanks very much.  I was looking forward to meeting you as well.  I plan on coming to Houston soon, and I'll look you up when I'm there.  Best, Jeff 
 Just give a call when you get a chance.  I'm in.  415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Well, I guess my good friend Jerry's a little to busy these days.  I'm going to contact another lawyer who represents some big QFs and then loop back with Jerry.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds like a plan. 
 The best I've ever had in my whole entire life, anywhere in the world.  Seriously, I think the guests--including me--thought that it was fabulous. I know Prentice finished hers, so I assume she liked it.  Cameron......well, you'll have to ask her.  The mango chutney combined with the curry was, like, death raging, man.  Best, Jeff 
 I think it would be great for us to have one.  Man, it's tough using that thing.  You gals sounded great from Prentice's bedroom when you were doing the final cuts.  Are we getting a copy?  Might be nice to have a copy of the "raw" tape.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Evie.  1) If someone writes a decent appeal, might you folks be interested in signing? 2) Do you have Michael's # where I can reach him tomorrow.  Sorry for the bother.  And if you'd like to hear about what we're thinking about regarding QFs, be happy to share it with you as well.  Be safe, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I think that's, well, a very aggressive view of how IOU debt and past and forward DWR costs are likely to be treated.  Be happy to discuss further if you like.  Best, Jeff 
 Just let me know. 
 left message for calger.  will call when i hear back from him. jeff 
 Missed the analyst call.  What was your take?  And you hearing that Lay's calling Edison today?  Best, Jeff 
 ditto.  got a little choked up...  best, Jeff 
 Tribolet sez he doesn't know anything about the Lay/Edison call, but he said Wanda mentioned something about it.  You may want to check in with her.  I'm still waiting to hear from Calger.  Best, Jeff 
 did you hear that commerce1 announced today that it's laying off 50% of its people?  sounds very ugly.  but i guess that means less competition for you.  best, Jeff 
 Didn't see the release.  They gonna be a softwary provider, or something? 
 In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing." The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions. Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial. In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds. Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below. If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.  Best, Jeff  "We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21 
 DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date. In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts. Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.  Best, Jeff 
 Just a reminder:  Beginning tomorrow, the (formerly twice-weekly) California call will now take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT/1:30 CDT), same call-in number. Until the next legislative session starts up in January, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento, unless something specific requires their participation.  Best, Jeff 
 thank you. 
 great.  see you at 4:30 today. 
 Looks like Prentice and Nancy will be getting together in Napa to do a little bonding this weekend.  Therefore, it looks like an opportunity to golf on Saturday or Sunday (screw football).  Any takers?  (Eldon has promised not to be the score Nazi.)  Best, Jeff 
 Folks: Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks feel about it generally.  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff 
 what stuff? 
 I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.  Best, Jeff 
     1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt point capacity. P.44  2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity. P.45  3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate. This is the same cap that applies to SoCal.P.46  4)Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a delivery/receipt at Ferc.  5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed 55 BCF. P.52 &54.  6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share of non-reliability storage service.P. 58  7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers.P.62  8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider. P.63  9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. P.66  10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. P. 75  11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. The PD estimates an additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be approx. $ 44.4 Million.  12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4 cents).P.83.  13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis. P.85-87  14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . P 88-100.  15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA. P. 103-110. 
 Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes. In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron. This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions. A story related to the deal is attached. If you have any questions, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Chris: A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday): A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim. After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter. In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution. We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.) For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs. We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC.  With respect to what else we could offer them: From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge. One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.) Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective. One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon. This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors. The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.  Hope this helps.  Best, Jeff 
 Cool.  If $150 don't cut it on the check, just let me know.  No sweat.  EVERYTHING is confidential. 
 We might be able to communicate this less formally through our lobbyists.  If it's OK, let me check with them first, and then I'll get back to you.  Sound good?  Best, Jeff 
 Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices. 
 Greetings.  I can make it.  Is there a specific topic/agenda?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Rita:  Not sure if I did this right.  Was the idea to rank no more than 5, using 1= -5, or more the way I did it.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 Any reason in particular that you're of this view?  (I'm hoping you'll say that Edison's informed you that it might be doable.) 
 I like Saturday afternoon after your lesson, since we've got a wedding at 3 pm on Sunday to go to. 
 I think Sanders has always thought that the Reliant deal offers sufficient protections.  Not sure that Kirby and Gibb agree.  We'll have to wait and see.  Best, Jeff 
 that's what i was afraid of. i'll try again and resend.  sorry about that.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll take care of it and if there's anything we need to do, I'll let you know.  Best, Jeff 
 You got it. You're right, distribution lists are a challenge.  I'll make sure that you and these folks get on the list.  Hope all finds you well.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.  We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week) It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary. If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue). Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Glen: Good call this AM.  Mike Day is in fact writing some comments on behalf of Wild Goose and there may be some interest from other folks to sign on and file jointly.  However, Mike won't have something to look at before COB tomorrow, and it's unclear at this point how many folks might sign on.  So I think it's prudent to continue drafting TW's comments.  As soon as I get something from Mike Day, I'll forward to you so you folks can review.  Best, Jeff 
 DWR can meet with us on October 22nd. This work for you folks?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Elyse: I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Hilda: I got an "out of office" reply from Elyse that mentions that you're the contact in her absense.  Please see the note below.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes. 
 FYI. 
 thank you. 
 FYI.  Today, the PG&E Corporation Board of Directors elected Dede Hapner, currently Vice President -Regulatory Relations of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, as Vice President - Special Projects, for PG&E Corporation, effectively immediately.  Dede will report to Steve Kline and will be located in the PG&E Corporation Washington D.C. office.  Karen Tomcala, currently Director, Federal Governmental and Regulatory Relations of PG&E Corporation, was elected today by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Board to replace Dede. 
 Might be able to do Sunday morning.  Eldon's going to check and see if there's a tee time.  Will report back as the news breaks. 
 Thank very much Joseph.  Alan and Sue, I'm comfortable canceling tomorrow's call unless either of you have a burning issue to discuss.  We can start with the new arrangements beginning next Thursday, assuming that works for folks.  Best, Jeff 
 I think Sue should come down with something (I know I would).  Horowitz? Eegads. He will be relentless...  Looks like this group likes a good food fight. 
 party pooper. (i understand. always more complicated than necessary.) 
 Interesting.  Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really need to get certified for diving."  Question 2: How hot is it down there?  Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer? 
 My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that).  About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state.  I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM.  So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11.  That work?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Rachel:  John White asked me to contact you.  He said you could email me a copy of the letter that you and Sarah are working on regarding Carl Wood's statements about green direct access.  Is possible to get a copy emailed?  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Great.  Tom will get back to me to confirm that 11 AM works for him.  I'll let you know.  Best, Jeff 
 Speech apparently was not quite as sharp as recent ones, but heard the event overall was very good. 
 Hope you're well.  best, Jeff 
 Bev: Based on yesterday's conversation, we've set up a call for 2 PM California time on Friday.  Here's the call-in info.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much. 
 Tee hee.  More questions to follow.  Can't wait for the answers.... 
 interesting.  thanks. 
 FYI.  Latest info is that large customers, some QF cogens, independent storage companies, and perhaps PG&E, will be filing separate comments supporting the Bilas decision to adopt the settlement. 
 Mike Day's firm could do it, but they'll charge for the adminstrative costs necessary to file (we don't have the support necessary to file).  Does that work?  If so, I'll need to contact Mike promptly so they can get prepared to do the filing.  No word yet as to whether SoCalGas will support. 
 PS  The cost of having Day's firm file for you folks wouldn't be more than $100-200. 
 Thanks.  Sorry for the latest. Was on the road this morning. 
  good, since i don't think riordan would take me.  best,jeff 
 that sounds sweet.  if you can get tickets for me and prentice, i'm happy to pay for them.  just let me know. 
 Jeff Dasovich Enron Corp 101 California Street, Suite 1950 San Francisco, CA  94111 
 Super. Dave will get back to you with the details.  Thanks for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Look like the stuff? 
 ditto? 
 I assume that you don' t need Mike Day to file TW's comments.  You got it covered?  Just let me know.  Jeff 415.782.7822 
 Eldon's got a 9:20 AM time on Monday morning, if you're interested.

 FYI. SoCalGas is filing in favor of the decision adopting the settlement.  Best, Jeff 
 The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch. The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers. He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1. We have started working with large customers to refute the letter. If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.  Best, Jeff 
 Jesus, I'm on acid.  I meant Sunday morning. 
 Here is a brief summary of the latest DA proposal floating around the Senate.  The provisions could--and likely will--change.  The leader of the Senate (Burton) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.  No suspension of DA. All customers must pay Edison undercollection, whether they've been DA or not. Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for. Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees. The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs. Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position. 
 We'll continue to scour the universe for it. 
 Forgive my ignorance, but I'm assuming that "related party transactions" refers to the Fastow deals? 
 I THINK this is where I'll be this week.  San Francisco:  Mon-Thur Friday:		Palm Springs at the conference I'm speaking at with EES 
 Every Monday at 10:30 AM (Houston time), which is, more or less, a company-wide call. Every Wednesday at 1:30 PM (Houston time), which is a Government Affairs-only call.  Those are it.  If there's anything else, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.  The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.  In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:  Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis. Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.  Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.  Any thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll be on. 
 FYI.  If I've missed anyone who might be interested, please forward along. Best, Jeff CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS Friday, October 19, 2001 [1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at [18]. [18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority's siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need." Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. [ 
 10-ish percent. 
 FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy. Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority. 
 Barry:  Good to meet you last week.  I'm out of the office until Monday, but will get on this as soon as I return.  Of this group, Dynegy is involved in the State Senate's investigation.  Best, Jeff 
 This is the last straw:  Peace just called to thank us for resolving the contempt issue.  He then went on ad nauseum--and I mean nauseum--about just about everything in the world.  Unreal.  I told him that in exchange, we expected him to get rid of Bill Lockyear.  Richard:  He complained a little about Kirby.  I told him Kirby was worth his weight in gold.  Best, Jeff 
 You get a hold of Bob Williams? 
 Hey, I was wrong. I went back and checked.  DA got as high as about 16% of total load in May 2000.  On January 1 (contracry to Herr Angelides' letter), DA was about 7.3% of load.  On February 1 it was 3.5%.  Best, Jeff 
 this is true.  good point. 
 FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.  Best, Jeff 
 congratulations.  just more evidence that regulation moves with lightening speed! 
 I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.  We can hold off on that.  In addition, I may have some "salvaged" redwood decking I may want to add to the mix once I get ready to install the decking.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the cc.  Nice touch.  Chalk up another one for the good guys.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Please keep confidential and do not circulate.  This is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the Angelides tantrum.  Only the large customers will sign, however.  I'll forward the final when they've completed it	.  Sue's working on ARM to do something akin from the suppliers side.  Best, Jeff 
 Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.  Best, Jeff 
 CONFIDENTIAL. Please don't distribute.  Evie's concerned that this letter might not be welcomed by or useful to Loretta.  I think it would be, but would be useful to have your/Loretta's views. Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Immediately? 
 I should be able to find out something by this afternoon, or tomorrow AM at the latest.  I'll get back to you as soon as I hear something.  Jeff 
 Thank you.  I would have said "governor turkey." =20 
 give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change, modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one works.  when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.  i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.  best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much for the update. 
 can you email the most recent version of the QF buy-out presentation?  I want to forward it to Tom Beach (consultant to CCC) prior to Wednesday.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 Jeez, nice company.  Putting you up for 10 days at the Waldorf.  I love that neighborhood.  Anywho, I'll check those dates and get back to you. 
 Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).  Question:  Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?  One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Brad: I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you. 
 FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it.  Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?  Best, Jeff 
 Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with Edison.  1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?  Best, Jeff 
 Paul:  Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.  Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area. Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature. Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs). Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like. In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated. When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities. Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition. And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led. Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.  I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  Hope all's going well in your new venture (or semi-new venture at this point).  You finishing this semester? Anyway, I was reading this press account and was wondering if you new this fellow when you were at Lehman.  If so, any insights?  Sort of an interesting career path.  Say hi to your better half. Best, Jeff ************************************************************************************** California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds. The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November. The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually. Calls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time. 
  Tom: Here's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow. If you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at 415.782.7822. What number should I call you at tomorrow?  Best, Jeff 
 at the all-employee meeting, someone just asked Lay if he was on crack.  broke the place up. jeff 
 Oh, great. Our next call will be from Steve Peace. 
 thanks. 
 Great questions. Some brief responses. We can discuss further tomorrow. 
 Molly gets all her picks from "The Living Guide to Picking NFL Winners" by Martha Stewart.  Note on p. 12 of this months version:  Martha shows how to make hanging planters out of the jock straps worn by the front line of the New England Patriots. 
 Kean, Kirby, Gibb, me.  Lots of fun.  Not.  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is.  It's somewhat quick, but I don' t know what your timeline is (hopefully quick).  Let me know what you think (hope you don't mind that I modified your title).  Any word from Loretta re: whether a letter from big customers would help in the fight against tantrums from Angelides?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  In case Martin's interested...  Best, Jeff 
 Forget that, I'm expecting a new hanging planter for Christmas.  (Tee hee).  Kisses, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Sounds good.  Did you say that you're living out in west Marin now (one of my favorite places and old stomping grounds)?  I'm one of the many, the shameful, that's not finishing (though I'll only have one class in the Spring.  Take care.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm reporting this obvious attempt at collusion and pool-fixing to the commissioner!  Figures that the Commissioner's wife is in on it.  (Isn't that always the way it is?) 
 Well, not just any jock strap.  Maybe you could model a few and I can pick one.  Don't want it to clash with the furniture.... 
 Guess who?  Me again.  You thought about having your guy Jack (who's likely got the most juice of anyone in the group) go to the Governor and tell him to tell Angelides to knock it off and to back off?  Second, what do you think about sending the letter directly to Angelides--after all, he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing Loretta?  Third, I should be able to get you something on our view of RTOs.  Best, Jeff 
 dee-lish-ush dinner--the tart was especially yummy.  thanks very much.  by the way, was that a regular tart? 
 FYI.  Left him a message.  Will report back when we hook up.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you, O wise one.  I'm sure that Jack will thank you for preserving his fluids. 
 Dear folks: Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  Hope to see all of you very soon.  Be safe.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks. 
 I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:  They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.  If you have any questions, let us know.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies, don't know how in the heck I missed you on the list.  (You know just clawing and backstabbing my way to the top.)   Anywho, here's the note that I just sent.  Let me know if there's anyone else that I embarassingly missed.  Best, Jeff 
 Dan: Is this also information that you'd like to be kept apprised of.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  Please let Michael know that we'll be coming in business casual attire. Hope that's OK.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Talked to Edison about getting a meeting with Craver.  They're going to get back to me.  Best, Jeff 
 Edison did not bring up the refund issue at all (doesn't mean that they won't, though).  Agree on the AB 1890 issue.  The clock stops in March of '02.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim: FYI. 
 Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts? 
 Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:  Total debt = 6.35 B After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to. The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM. 
 Sorry I missed your call.  Thanks very much.  Wanted to make sure that I ha= d the correct copies for release.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's what I'll do.  I'll go back and look at the materials they sent us.  Maybe you could do the same, so at least we have an idea of what they'll claim our "contribution" is.  Best, Jeff 
 PS  Ask me how tired of this bleeping issue I am.  Hang in there. 
 Under Angelides flawed reasoning, shouldn't energy efficiency be outlawed, since every kilowatt saved means less money to pay DWR for the contracts and the bonds to fill the hole in the state budget?  Why pick on DA?  Best, Jeff 
 I asked Mike Day to make sure that we were kept in the distribution loop on this stuff.  Best, Jeff 
 What's your fax number? 
 thanks.  it's on its way.  i'll give you a call, or give me a call when you've had a chance to look at it.  i'll include steve swain on the fax. 
 Greetings: Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing something, or don't have this right, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 No, I don't think so.  Haley and Wil's vocabularies may expanded a bit, though.  Thanks again for  having them.  Very kind of you.  Best, Jeff  PS  You guys get all the cards. 
 Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for. We had a good talk. I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.  Best, Jeff 
 Could you forward the gas daily article?  Thanks.  Jeff 
 u still in DC? jeff 
 Could you make sure that whomever's doing the letter to the California Ds gets a copy to me and Sue (want to keep the family happy, don't you know).  Thanks a million.  Boy do we need the cash from that merger.  Please hurry.  Best, Jeff 
 You know what is more recently?  Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San Diego (they said).  So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.  Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.  Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.  I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss. In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?  Might be a good idea to keep doing that.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes.  I called him yesterday after the call and filled him in on all the details. So he's up to speed; but feel free to forward. Best, Jeff  Also, didn't want to put in the note, but I got the impression from Fielder that he's not real keen on extending the stipulation.  But I think we should push it, if for no other reason than to keep the PUC out of it. 
 u get message from tribolet. re: px credit call at 4 pm (CDT)? jeff 
 Thanks.  Laurie:  I'll assume that we'll meet at 7:45-8:00 at the front desk to coordinate a little bit?  Best, Jeff 
 You know, I ran into Martha once (literally) in Washington D.C. 
 I like it.......you first. 
 I actually did get them, it appear.  Apologies. 
 Hi Mark:  Any chance of meeting with you and the gang from DWR on Monday morning or sometime Tuesday?  Best, Jeff 
 no. body to body. 
 Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday.  The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said.  In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said.  Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said.  The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total.  According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market.  The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years.  Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices.  The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said.  The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp.

 Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:  1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them. 2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."  Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.  Best, Jeff 
 Those were Rick's and Steffe's.  I was never sure where they came from and didn't use them, per se.  We can talk more about it. 
 on phone with DWR trying to get a meeting for Tycholiz.  will get on phone pronto. 
 Thanks. 
 you're such a kidder. 
 bumpy times.  gonna take alot of work to come back.  i'll fill you in some time. 
 talked to karen denne.  she saw presentation and agrees.  she's going to call sue. 
 Sweetheart, very sorry to hear.  You're in my thoughts and prayers and I ho= pe you're doing OK.  Sometimes, things just aren't very fair. =20 Best, Jeff 
 fyi.  sue's at home.  try her cell phone 415.902.4108.  best, Jeff 
 Sue's presentation. 
 And here are my comments. 
 FYI. 
 got your message.  one set of golf clubs--right-handed--is all that i'll ne= ed (well, that and about 100 golf lessons!).  thanks for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 His name is Sean Steele.  I'll have his number pronto. 
 Oops. It's Shawn, not Sean.  And here's what I got.  Shawn Steele 323-951-9000 (law office) 818-841-5210 (Rep. Party HQ) 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry about that.  I'll get back to you with some other dates. 
 Jim: Let Jeremy know that there will be some big dogs (i.e., large customers) coming out with guns a'blazin' on this and that we're working closely with them.  Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.  The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.  Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?  Best, Jeff 
 You ain't kidding.  Hope you and yours are OK, given the circumstances.  All the best. Jeff 
 Thanks very much.  I'll try to subscribe again. Hey, forgive me for being a snoop, but do you not wear glasses at all anymore?  Signed, Four eyes 
 I thought that might be the case.  Didn't want to be so bold as to bring it up, though.  You looked great with glasses.  You look great without them.  Thanks again for the email.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey, I can't find steve kelly's email.  can you forward this to him? 
 I'm not interested.  But is it more, or less, than you described? 
 which game is it? 
 you're fired. 
 Trying again.  Best, Jeff 
 Prentice will call you. 
 How do the 13th or 20th of November work? 
 You see this?  What the hell is with Cramer?   Date      October 25, 2001 Time      07:00 AM - 08:00 AM Station   CNBC Location  Network Program   The Squawk Box   Mark Haines, co-anchor:  Joe Kernen, what's going on?  Joe Kernen, co-anchor:  We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit, David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred million in revenues.  James Cramer, guest market commentator:  Maybe.  Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and...  Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it.  That's my bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months, made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there we're going to discover this.  Kernen:  Let's see what happened...  Haines:  Now, wait a second...  David Faber, co-anchor:  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is that new?  Is that something--  Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor, something...  Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?  Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward thinking.  Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr.--  Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking about.  Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?  Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's yesterday's trading--  Haines:  Wait a minute.  Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now. That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that Fastow, after four--  Faber:  Late yesterday.  Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's interesting--  Faber:  He's the CFO--  Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.  Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships.  Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not on thin ice.  Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory.  Cramer:  This is my theory.  Haines:  OK.  Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred.  Haines:  OK.  Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.  Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market down.  Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and those who've left the company as investors over this last week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their investors, they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about.  Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go down, how would that affect energy trading?  Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades.  Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?  Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies, maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.  Kernen:  Now, why would--  Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.  Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right? Because of something that could unravel--  Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities they may have--  Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.  Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability? They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--  Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?  Faber:  They don't know.  Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited partners?  Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is what some analysts estimated.  Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.  Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves.  Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.  Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got hurt.  Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.  Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.  Kernen:  You are.  Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.  Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the utility average.  I've worried about the transportation average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this chart?  We're breaking below the--  Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.  Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?  Cramer:  I'm all fired up!  Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you going down to Houston yourself?  Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that whole city.  Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?  Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much stronger than before.  Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at this point.  That's a long way.  Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but I still think that--  Kernen:  It's no longer the--  Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.  # # # 
 Thanks.  Love to catch up on Tuesday when I get back, if that works for you.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the invite, but I have class.  She have a job yet? 
 Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.  Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.  That work?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll contact Lydia and you'll have materials well in advance of the meeting. 
  Hi Lydia:  Could you let me know what time in the afternoon of November 13th works with Brad's schedule?  Will need 60 minutes.  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 It's going to be sometime in the afternoon on the 13th. 
 Nice job.  In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision? Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.  Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.  Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.  Best, Jeff 
 Baldwin's secretary called.  He's going to check with DWR and get back to me tomorrow morning regarding whether Monday or Tuesday will work.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Unlucky you.  It's me again, calling about setting up a meeting with Ms Doll.  Any word?  Greatly appreciate your efforts.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem.  No hurry.  Whenever you've got it ready is great.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim:  Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:  1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE 2) Edison "meet and confer" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th. 3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.  2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.  We have a number yet for the call?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Bob:  Could you please leave on my voicemail the call-in number to discuss the meet and confer call that's happening with Edison?  When exactly is that meeting?  Is it California or Houston.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 Let's try this.  It's all inter-related.  PG&E, the prehearing conference and our workout with Edison.  Can we have one call that you includes all who need to be involved?  (I'm thinking, Steffes, you, Tribolet, me. Mellencamp, Wanda, Sue). That make sense?  Let me know.  Easiest thing would  likely be to set up a call-in number (I'm mobile today).  Thanks alot.  Best, Jeff 
 The pleasure was all mine.  You did a fantastic job with the presentation (both developing and presenting it).  Likewise, it lifted my spirits in these challenging times to meet someone as talented (and fun!) as you.  Hope our paths cross again often.  Never hesitate to get in touch if there's anything I can do.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks to all of you for your help with this.  Made my participation practically effortless, and more important, alot of fun.  Great job.  Best, Jeff 
 Actually, I'm travelling tomorrow.  If we could do it between 8 and 9:30 AM (PST), that would work.  Otherwise, I'll need to do Wednesday if possible.  Best, Jeff 
 Horowitz never had a chance. 
 Really appreciate it.  Will you be attending? 
 Great.  Just to make sure.  I've got an address of 3310 El Camino, Suite 120. This correct?  Is there a number there in case something comes up?  Best, Jeff 
 3310 El Camino (Sacramento).  Suite 120. 
 Just sent you yahoo map/directions on how to get to DWR. 
 Hi Cynthia:  I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday, Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM (want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is where I always rent).  Is this something that you folks generally arrange, or do I just do it?  Is there a corporate account # I'll need if I do it?  Really appreciate your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, I've got a "devil" of an idea to try to keep our weekend from becoming "hellish."  Should we start emailing what we need to do/get?  I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g., oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc. 
 Greetings:  The Commission denied it.  Work is underway to appeal the Commission's decision to the courts.  Sue Mara is taking the lead on this for us.  She can update you on where the appeal stands.  Be great to get you support for/participation in the appeal.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds good.  My cell phone number is 415.505.6633. Jeff 
 Can we have chat again between now and COB Wednesday (like we did night before PG&E meeting) to get ourselves in order for the Edison meeting? 
 Obviously worth the time.  Great letter.  Thanks for sharing...  Best, Jeff  You folks gearing up to respond to Karl Woods questions regarding why the suspension should be pushed back to July 1? 
 Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. "If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. "Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. "This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. "We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." "Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals." 
 You folks giving this to the press?  Might be useful. 
 You won't believe this.  Jerry Bloom left me a message.  Wants to talk, though I wouldn't get my hopes up.  I'll let you know what he says.  Best, Jeff 
 You have time to talk a bit more about what we were discussing on the call?  In particular, impact on the book of negotations around the PX credit calc going foward?  Jeff 
  There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).  Best, Jeff 
 I have a 3. I'll call at 4. 
 Thanks so much.  Really appreciate it.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  See you at 10. 
 FYI.  Suggested addressing it to Angelides, but they didn't want to "dignify" his letter.  They decided that, ultimately, Loretta's in charge, and addressed it to her.  Had a great talk with Sarah.  She's following up on a few things.  You may want to touch base with her re: hearings on DWR rev. req.  You ever received my (modest) edits to the Karl Wood letter?  Best, Jeff  PS Is that article you sent me re: bad contracts from today's papers? 
 Does this mean I shouldn't have talked to the Journal regarding my views of= merger?  Ooops.  I'll refer inquiries to you from now on....  Seriously, hope (given the circumstances) that all finds you well.  Best, Jeff 
 With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:  Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts. Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal. Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.  We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 Couple of additional pieces of information:  In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward. It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.). So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter. Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions. Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.  Best, Jeff 
 Fielder's traveling today.  Left him a long message on his voicemail and asked him to get back to me as soon as he gets a chance.  Best, Jeff 
 Steve:  Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.  Best, Jeff 
 agreed. 
 You take care.  If for whatever reason, there's anything I can do, please j= ust ask. =20 Best, Jeff 
 zero 
 apologies.  i don't know what those bills are....  Best, Jeff 
 Yep.  It's moving along.  The budget, and the R's desire to mess with Davis, are prolonging things a bit.  But all indications are that Loretta will hold DA until the 12th.  How'd the afternoon go?  Best, Jeff 
  FYI.  Not for dissemination outside this distribution.  Documents delivered to Hertzberg to follow.  Best, Jeff 
 Please keep this confidential and internal to the company.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Congratz.  Do we know for how long a decision will be delayed?  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Hedy. Barring any strange turn of events, we're likely to be OK with the language.  The budget--and the R's desire to mess with Davis--appear to be delaying things somewhat.  If tomorrow Loretta holds the DA decision till the 12th, that will buy some additional  (and necessary) time to work a deal.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore).  In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on.  That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.  Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  Happy 4th to all.  Best, Jeff 
 It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get an amendment here.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the proposal:  There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end. The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.) If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 thanks, paul.  apologies, i dont' even remember seeing this.  leslie, can we discuss on thursday.  i  can update you on everything underway w.r.t. cal gas.  thursday work for you?  best, jeff 
 Yes. 
 8 AM. 10 AM. 3 PM.  Best, Jeff 
 Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.  Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments. Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to provide the specific language). I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll provide legislative language shortly . Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 thanks for everything.  really 'ppreciate it, 'migo.   and please thank karen, too.  also, would you tell her that prentice and i are willing and able (we think) to help out in any way we can in putting the fireplace stuff together----i.e., anything that doesn't require real skill, like sticking tiles on the board.  just let us know.  Best, Jeff   tah-mo 
 Thanks.  As you know, I'm in the negotiations.  It's the best chance there = is to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether C= alifornia can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard= to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with = Jan would be useful and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.  I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds.  In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?  Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.  Best, Jeff 
 yes. 
 Please take a look and see if you think it does what we're after.  I'd like to share with folks as soon as possible to try to get something in the bill.  Best, Jeff 
 Just talked to Fielder. U have 5 minutes to debrief?  Sending this to Kean/Shapiro/Steffes.  Jeff 
 i'd send to the big list.  i used to send what julie malinowski sent around. 
 Thanks for you comments.  I did this prior to the meeting w/Keeley yesterday.  I assume that, if this thing gets off the ground, we'll have the opportunity to get this thoughts into whatever it is that the legislature produces.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  From today's Post.  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.  Best, Jeff ********************************************************************** Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr  07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. "We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. "What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. "It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.

Daschle's aides and party strategists say = the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, d= raw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation an= d alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' cha= rges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both side= s see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sig= n. =09 =09 "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you g= o with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people act= ually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  De= mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.= Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus= h is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R= epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and = gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w= ith support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House sou= ndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an= opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," sa= id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy= came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c= ommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum = wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth= er issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic= y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican = issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President = Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th= e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ= y needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden = to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce= nt end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp= oke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for = the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N= ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm= ittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I= t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in = May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex= t week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme= nt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin= g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne= ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped = defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac= k its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain o= ver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of = Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte= rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a= lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants= that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati= on and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor= t utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo= my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi= s month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle = extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ= icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co= llins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc= Cain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights= and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio= n measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobb= ling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe= llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a= dviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc= ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment= ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it= s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend= ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als= o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp= ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the= president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee= ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials= say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ= y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas= kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f= or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr= oval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t= he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin= g blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and = last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call= for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue = and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui= ck solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a polit= ical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate.

 You can send both, but I'd have folks keep it close to the vest.  Definitely want to make sure that none of our stuff ends up in the hands of the media. 
 Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.  Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.) Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process. 
 Gee, now that's a "rib"-tickler. 
 Thanks very much Mike.  The sense of urgency for getting this in "the mix" is not as high as it was yesterday, though we'll still need to introduce it at some point very soon.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 nope. 
   California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel T= aub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray= Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric= ity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a= misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power pur= chases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Da= vis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on= the office's press list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state p= ower purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contract= s. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market i= nvoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed= through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w= hich are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of= the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t= he day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  Accord= ing to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity = for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li= ght 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $14= 9.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura= te.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me= gawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloombe= rg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a= ccording to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on= the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma= rket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str= ategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legis= lators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft= er they are signed.  =09 
 gee, tough break. 
 Will do.  Best, Jeff 
 can we talk about this? 
 Sorry, but no. 
 Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.  The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session. The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.  The Legislature's options: 1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning. 2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning. 3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.  In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.  Where to from here? Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July. Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however. Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough. With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive. Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said: Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses." He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session." With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.  If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.  We'll report back with additional information as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.  07/06/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  (changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold. Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. "Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

Best, Jeff ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Campaign funds will pay for spots Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, July 7, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. "The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19. Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. "One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. "These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. "What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President Bush in 2004. Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. "We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said. E-mail Robert Salladay at rsalladay@sfchronicle.com. ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 6 
 Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.  Sure that  errors remain, but this version should at least be somewhat closer.  Changes are in strike-out-underline.  Best, Jeff 
 Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Below is an update from the weekend's activities.  The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format. The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT). The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday). As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin. The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal. Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis. In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially. Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.  Best, Jeff 
 Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's not creating undue headaches.  Best, Jeff 
 i'll be participating.  thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Last time I was in Houston, an IT tech deleted everything---I mean everything---so I need to hunt it down.  Will do so immediately and get you a copy. Best, Jeff 
 Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 This looks like LA Times/Wall Street Journal material...... 
 Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 30-60 minutes.  Thanks to Delaney for all the work.  Best, Jeff 
 Ditto. 
 Sounds good.  How about first thing tomorrow morning for a call? 
 P.S.  Have discussed with Dorothy and will attempt to capture in my proposed edits our discussion.  Best, Jeff 
 may have been updated a bit prior to the presentation, but yep, that's it.  will do for now.  please forward to rick.  when i'm back in the office i'll do more searching.  thanks a bunch.  i'm assuming this is what he's referring to.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks: Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.  They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.  Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.  In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.  Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.  Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).  Best, Jeff 
 "Sacramento or Salem?"  Sort of has a nice ring to it. 
 No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.  Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.  Thanks very much for the comments.  Best, Jeff 
 You're a saint. 
 Thanks Barbara: Dorothy just phoned me and I believe we're all squared away.  Can you call her and make sure that you're comfortable?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi:  Thanks for the wires story.  I talked to Dorothy and we're square.  If anyone tries to make any other changes, please let me know first or have them call me directly, whichever you prefer.  Thanks for all your help.  Best, Jeff 
 No comments.   And continued good luck with the process.  Best, Jeff 
 Religion, huh?  Interesting.  Your folks may disown you, though.  I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?  The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.  Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.  The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?  Next week or week after?  (May want to wait until plane service gets normal?)  Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?  Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!  Sell the flat, dammit.  Kisses, Jeff  PS Colleen doing OK?  I can come by after class on Wednesday--class is at Boalt, so we get out at 8:30, you know what slackers law students are.... 
 The Bond Legislation The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.  The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."  The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.  Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.  Best, Jeff 
 Heeeeeeeeeeeeee Haaaaaaaaaaawww!!!!!   Gouge dat taht moh! 
 It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me know when you're going to be here.  Love to have dinner and catch up.  You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great if you got involved.  Hope all is well with you and yours.  Best, Jeff 
 Appreciate it.  Take care.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Could you please forward to Bev?  More arrows for our quiver in trying to get out the truth.  Best, Jeff 
  California; Metro Desk Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show. RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS  07/10/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California. Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."

 Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.  FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that:  "Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. "  Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.  Best, Jeff 
 Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:  Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads:  This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service.  I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.  There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term. Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).  Thanks again for all the effort.  Best, Jeff 
 any sense of why all the pulling? 
 Found the final.  Don't know if it differs from the one distributed yesterday.  Best, Jeff
