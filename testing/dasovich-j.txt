enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance the contracts are likely, state officials have said.  But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover. Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to be sold.  The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.  The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since last year.  After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down Monday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. Gray Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.  Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.  An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the generators than what he thinks the state is owed.  -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com

 California Power-Price Boost Not Needed, Agency Says (Update1) By Daniel Taub   Sacramento, California, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California regulators won't need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf of the state's utilities.  The California Department of Water Resources, which has spent more than $7.7 billion on power this year, is expected to recommend a rate increase of as much as 25 percent, Dow Jones reported today, citing three unnamed members of the state's Public Utilities Commission. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the agency, said no rate increase is expected.  ``Our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what our numbers show,'' Hidalgo said. ``In fact our numbers show that there is no need for any increase beyond what's already been done.''  The Department of Water Resources will submit a report to the California Public Utilities Commission today or Monday with the state's revenue requirements for repaying a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, Hidalgo said. The bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by PG&E Corp., Edison International and Sempra Energy.  The bond sales, the largest municipal offering in U.S. history, are scheduled to begin in September. Governor Gray Davis has said repeatedly that he believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases. His position hasn't changed, spokesman Steve Maviglio said today.  Previous Increases  In March, the PUC voted to boost rates by 3 cents a kilowatt- hour at the state's two largest utilities. Rates at PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest California utility, would rise by as much as 36 percent and Southern California Edison rates would rise by as much as 27 percent, the PUC said at the time.  The average consumer-price increase would be 30 percent, the PUC said. The increase, the second this year, was intended to help the state pay for power purchases. The PUC voted in January to raise rates about 10 percent.  California Treasurer Philip Angelides has said that the bonds will let the state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by spreading power costs over time. The debt will be repaid over 15 years.  Investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt.  Legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment. That pledge, typical for revenue bonds, usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an added cushion.  That formula, known as a debt service coverage ratio, must result in investment-grade ratings for California's power bonds, according to the legislation. Investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to maintain the promised cushion, even if increases aren't needed at the time of the bond sale.

D.00-08-023 and D.00-09-075.  These transactions are limited to contracts which must expire on or before 12-31-05.  Initial contracts are subject to a blanket reasonableness test (if less than 5% above cost of non-forward cost of portfolio=deemed reasonable)  but contracts after 12-31-02 will be subject to a CPUC preapproval process.

We are looking for a similar resolution or decision for Sempra.  Haven't found it yet, but we believe they have been given similar authority. 
 Here's the latest that we have on the legislation ("82XX") released on Friday. The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an "informational" hearing on 82XX at 1:30 PM PDT today. "Informational" means that there won't be a vote today. Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an "author"  of 82XX), Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant. The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution. Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with the "more recent version" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other authors had agreed to final language from their perspective. Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out tomorrow. PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the Commission gives up all review of DWR's "revenue requirement" and simply flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree). As a result, details of any "rate agreement" between DWR and the CPUC, and any public announcement by DWR of its "revenue requirement" is could be postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta. The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.  (They cite lower gas prices and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom, though many remain very skeptical.) However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate would be sufficient, according to the same consultants. The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday. It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday. In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an Edison "MOU," and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the Senate side appears strained. The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills. Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.  Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.  If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to contact me by pager @ 888.916.7184.  Best, Jeff

 Drew/Steve/Tony:  I've talked to Dan and he's available to represent Steve during his testimony on Wednesday.  Few things:  Dan's an excellent regulatory lawyer. Dan worked for many years at SoCalGas before going into private practice. Drew, I'll leave to you and Dan to work out the details of any contract for Dan's services. Dan will need immediately: A copy of Steve's testimony. A copy of the PUC Rulemaking, etc. calling for testimony. Any information on the list of parties who have indicated that they will cross Steve and for how long, and any testimony filed by those parties. In addition, I would recommend strongly that Dan and Steve (at a minimum) get on the phone and discuss Steve's testimony tomorrow, and plan to meet prior to the hearing on Wednesday.  If you'd like me to participate in a call tomorrow, just let me know.   If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would "impair" the contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.  As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the "no DA" language in AB1X and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Govenar" <sgovenar@govadv.com> 07/17/2001 11:27 AM Please respond to sgovenar 
 I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.  Few questions.  Mike, I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill? What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? What about large customers?  They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it. Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state?  Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.  Thanks again for the heads up.  Best, Jeff      James D Steffes 07/17/2001 07:43 AM 
 Thanks very much.  I'm assuming that Bev is there in her capacity as lobbyist for Wild Goose on this one?

I'm here in Sacramento, have alerted Hedy, told her that we're trying to gather more intelligence, and that you and your client are attempting to get folks together to mount opposition.  Give me a call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.

 What people know:  Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended. The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX). The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail. The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill. Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).  What people don't know: Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone). Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.  Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.  Best, Jeff  Sacramento is one goofy place. 
 Greetings Art.  Had a great time at the conference.  Thanks for inviting me. I have a comment about the proposed decision if you'd like it.  Let me know. What time do you need it?  And can I just email it to you?  It'll be quite brief and to the point.  Best, Jeff    MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> 11/30/2000 12:44 PM 
 USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says. By Gelu Sulugiuc  07/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. , EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday. The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper. "I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an ownership position in any other exchange platform," Piper said. With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the highest volume of all energy electronic platforms. Most energy trading platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits. Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day. But while ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline one can only trade with Enron. "It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business," Piper said. Enron is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States. About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic platform. "As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue to grow," Piper said. The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals, steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics. "We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get more traction," Piper said. "There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't even tapped into yet." Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success. The Atlanta-based exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its trade volumes. "Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different," Piper said. "But right now, there is room for the both of us." He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE. Many of the energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also Enron's biggest clients. "Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one," Piper said. INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States, Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of ways to become more successful. "The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline," Piper said. "But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional about it." One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different markets and regions. It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal. But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many exchange. "We want to focus in providing our markets to others," he said. "In the near term, we're not changing that." The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it. EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats off. "I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong," said Frank Getman, chief executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet. "If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the market, then people will continue to use your site." Enron's stock rose 41 cents to $49.53 a share on Tuesday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 Dear John: You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely upset.  Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last week.  To wit:  according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the alleged "overcharges."  John, combined, the government sellers, including CA munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, "overcharged" California by a factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have "overcharged." (See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.)  So notes like this, are ill-informed.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and LADWP.  Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, "well, it's not the gouging.  that's not the problem.   it's the "profit motive" we've set up that's the problem."  so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't control.  everyone else is blood-sucking scum.  (in addition, please inform Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to others.  it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR contract problem.)  Sorry for the flame, but it's gotten extremely tiresome, and  it ain't personal; but the emperor has no clothes, which will increasingly become increasingly apparent.  all that aside, we've got other work that's more important, and i look forward to continue working on it.  best, jeff     "V.

 Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B    =20 Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM=01;ET    =01;=20 =01;  By Mark Golden=20  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20   NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was=20 overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion wh= en=20 an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was= =20 taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.=20  The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid=20 operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its= =20 estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the= =20 judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers= =20 and the state over potential refunds last week.=20  Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the= =20 state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been calle= d=20 arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes "a=20 potential framework for settlement discussions," Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'= s=20 chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20  FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20 billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not= =20 negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund= s=20 due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700= =20 million.=20  Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun= ds=20 and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20  The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20 municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through= =20 the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi= a=20 Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20 those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20  "We know the volume (of the bilateral deals)," Hildebrandt said. "The refun= d=20 amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."= =20   Resetting The Baseline=20   Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the= =20 ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f= or=20 California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition= =20 to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20  The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news= ,=20 msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,= =20 msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has= =20 also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20 Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20  In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa= ir=20 prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by= =20 retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those=20 controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator= =20 needed to meet demand each hour.=20  But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagne= r=20 recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be= =20 modified when used retroactively to determine refunds.=20  Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mu= ch=20 further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag= e=20 of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20 recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20 considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou= ld=20 cut potential refunds sharply.=20  Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back = as=20 Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about= =20 one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20  ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20 Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May= =20 2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20  "The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20 overcharges going back to May should be repaid," McCorkle said. "We just=20 maintain that position."=20   FERC Baseline Questioned=20   In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when= =20 fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric= e=20 cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have= =20 been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20 demand.=20  That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato= rs=20 be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20  Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to= =20 $7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20  One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt= =20 said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units.

 Greetings.  Hope all is well.  Trade you energy for broadband.  Whaddya say?  Best, Jeff 
 Harry/Sue:  Have you looked at the places in 82XX that Scott FedEx-ed to you that implicate the "PX credit?"  I've gotta assume that Edison put it in, and I frankly, ain't had the chance to peek at it.  For that reason, I'm worried. Can you page me and let me know your take?  Best, Jeff 
 Yep.  Thanks. 
 Not going to D.C. after all.  Now the bad news:  that means I'll likely have to come back to Sacramento, instead. 
 Love to catch up.  When you get a minute tomorrow page me (I'm mobile this week) and we can talk.  888.916.7184.  Best, Jeff 
 Have you seen this? 
 Looks like Loretta's attempt to peel off the DWR contracts from the bonds at the PUC, which the Legislature has been contemplating but hasn't done anything about.  Best, Jeff 
 John:  I could be wrong about what I think Loretta's doing so make sure that somebody verifies before you pass on what I've said.  Could be totally wrong; but hope I'm right.  Best, Jeff 
 The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.  In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.  In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of the bill" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.  The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.  The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.  That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.  In short, little has changed since yesterday.  Best, Jeff

 thanks, babe. 
 FYI.  How would you like to handle?  Best, Jeff    Steven J Kean 07/19/2001 08:37 AM 
 The wierdness continues.....  In the Senate: After Burton's "proclamation" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was "all Edison was getting, period," the bill was voted down in committee and never made it to the full Senate for a vote. The bill will be "reconsidered" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same committee.  In the Assembly: Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched his vote and let it get out. 82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning. 83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted out of committee and will go to appropriations today.  Will report back later this AM with any additional information.  Best, Jeff 
 aye aye. 
 wow, that's blasephemous, dude.  hey, is there any chance that you might be able to pick up some instruments at Peacock today?  I was going to do it, but now have to go so fucking Sacramento.  need to get the cameron's guitar so you guys can take with you to Colorahdee.

 where can i call you?  needed to get cameron's guitar fixed so i can use it during the competition in colorado.  had to get it fixed at peacock, but need to pick up today (and prentice's) banjo, which is getting fixed.  where can i call you?  jeff 
 Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.  Other info from the conversation: With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as they go." Any vote on fines, etc. would only a require a simple majority to pass. 
 chk email re: Dunn info from Hedy.  Jeff 
 I don't recall agreeing to any of this.  We kid!  Looks fine to me. 
 As best I can figure, Reliant's included.  Best, Jeff 
 How's 8 AM PDT, 11 AM EDT?  Could you summarize for me precisely what she'd like to discuss?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff    Pat Shortridge 07/19/2001 02:46 PM 
 Scott: Can you try to find me bios of these folks?  Thanks very much. Jeff 
 Could not have happened to a nicer or more deserving bunch.  Congratulations and all the best.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes, 11 PDT works for me.  Understand what you need.  Will do best to deliver.  Best, Jeff 
 John:  Here are two alternatives to the language in AB1X.  The language does two things:  1) ensures that DA customers' costs are shifted to utility customers. 2) ensures that DA customers' don't unfairly escape any costs (e.g., bond payments, etc.)  We're assuming that you'll shop these with Lenny and we'll work the Reps on SB 18?  Lemme know.  Best, Jeff  415.505.6633 
 Correction:  1) ensures that DA customers' costs are NOT shifted to utility customers. 
 The Republicans are currently on the Senate floor arguing (noisily, repeatedly and passionately) that California (and the Senate in particular) is being hypocritical and intellectually dishonest in attacking and investigating private companies and ignoring munis.  One Senator specifically identified prices charged by LADWP and SMUD and compared those prices to Enron's (1/3 to 1/2 less than LADWP and SMUD charged).  Best, Jeff 
 In the Senate: Today the Senate passed out of committee SB18XX and is expected to pass the bill out of the full Senate sometime today. The bill would de-link 1) payment for bonds issued to repay General Fund dollars used to buy power from 2) payment for power contracts signed by DWR. The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the "Edison MOU" (SB78XX) out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a vote by the full Senate. It is unclear at this point whether the Senate will try to vote the MOU bill out of the Senate, or focus solely on SB18XX (de-linking bonds from DWR contracts) prior to leaving for vacation. Dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take depositions of individuals.  In the Assembly: The Assembly has thus far failed to get an "MOU" (82XX or 83XX) voted out of the full Assembly, though expectations are that the Hertzberg bill (82XX) will get voted out of the Assembly today. 
 man, you ain't kiddin'. 
 This looks good.  Is there any value in assigning people to the agenda items, e.g., "Special Session"--Sandi and Sac lobbyists"? 
 Will do.  Sue Mara, my colleague in the SF office, will join the call.  Tom, what's your number?  Best, Jeff    Pat Shortridge 07/19/2001 07:42 PM 
 Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at a minimum. In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will keep Edison out of bankruptcy. The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead). The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing.   In the Senate: SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate. The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of DWR contracts. The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the DWR contracts. The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or end, Direct Access. Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to substantial damages. As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly, its chances of passage there are low. SB72XX---The Senate's MOU The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50. The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and leadership is awesome.  In the Assembly: The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX) The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue. The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill (82XX). Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly Republicans. In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail. Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed. As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18. 
 Dude: Thanks a million for getting the instruments.  Sorry to burden with the chore. See you in Cah-lo-rah-dee.  Best, Jeff 
 Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy Former governor defends himself Carla Marinucci, Chronicle Political Writer Friday, July 20, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/20/MN187903.DTL Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis. "There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday. Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to blur perception of the current energy troubles. "They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush," said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a triumph -- for Davis." But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power." Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis -- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows. The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history." "If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday. "Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his mess." The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White House's energy policy. But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow your state the way they have . . . it creates problems." Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration. In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to seek state approval for new plants. While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I thought the flaws would be addressed." "We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while." But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's energy woes -- had benefits for the state. Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians." Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early 1970s -- to build large power plants. Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our handiwork." Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a crisis: emergency powers. Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the bridges within 65 days. South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- blown statewide energy crisis.

Gray Davis faces an uncertain future. The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen. The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers. Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison. Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. "It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days. "I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house." Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process. In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats and all 13 Republicans voted no. Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. "The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized." The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, which would put it back in the position of buying power. The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to garner more support. Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. "It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say I'm tentatively satisfied." Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. "As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a deadline, too much gets done." Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis. A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

 State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy Assembly plans own version for utility Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, July 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov.

 Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled By Jennifer Coleman Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison. The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year. "I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to creditworthiness," said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure. The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices. Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year option to buy Edison's grid. That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it "neither needs nor deserves. "I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation," Johnson said during floor debate. "The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation." During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15. "It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said Friday. For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has to reach Davis. "I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house." The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over 10 years. The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of "green" energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service. The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to "iron out the bills' differences," said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. "I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month," the governor said.

 Summary of the activities since Friday:  Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison MOU." Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.  In the Senate: The "Edison MOU": As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate. The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors. The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective. The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright. Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access. Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form. Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.  The "Dunn Investigation": Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday. The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies." Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday. In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn. She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th. If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.  The budget: The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning. The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th. That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.  The Assembly In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats. The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue. Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened. It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget. The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do. Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning. Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it. Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.  Best, Jeff

 NOT-SO-GOLDEN STATE Looks Like a Recession Economy on the edge Michael J. Boskin Sunday, July 22, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/22/I N144927.DTL California, the world's fifth largest economy, the global capital of technology and entertainment, is teetering on the brink of a serious recession. Unemployment is rising, job creation is falling and respected forecasters are painting a bleak future for the state. California is not alone. Nationally, the employment picture is also troubling. Income is flat. Industrial production has been shrinking for nine months. Only the mighty consumer has kept the economy going. The key problem is the slowdown in information technology spending, so important for California. Once the engine of productivity growth, and the source of rising standards of living, the double-digit pace of those spending increases slowed dramatically, beginning in the second half of last year. Since then, Silicon Valley companies have experienced sales declines of 5 to 10 percent, not calamitous drops, but compared to the 40 percent growth they had been used to, an enormous gap. Hence these companies have been cutting back on everything from production to personnel to facilities. The "new economy," it turns out, is not immune to the basic laws of economics. Nationally, the most respected "blue chip" private forecasters believe we will avoid a recession. They see the economy growing just over 1 percent this year and by 2 to 3 percent next year. Having been more optimistic for some years, I became more pessimistic last year, and remain so despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and the Bush administration's tax refunds. Whether we skirt the technical definition of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- will be a close call. We should see a modest recovery late this year, and a pick-up of steam in 2002. The California economy is in for a rougher time, at least in the short term. And this time -- unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California bore the brunt of the severe downturn in the defense industry -- the Bay Area will be hit much harder. While the region grew much faster than the rest of the state in the '90s, most of the symbols of that growth -- full employment, exploding property values, shrinking commercial vacancy rates -- are already history. Workers who just a short time ago were getting BMWs as a signing bonus are now being laid off. Statewide unemployment -- 5.1 percent last month -- is likely to increase another percentage point or more as layoffs continue in high tech and aerospace. Still -- and here's some good news -- Bay Area unemployment, even in Santa Clara County, which took a major hit in June, is still below the statewide rate. In per capita income, the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas are ranked first and second nationwide, 75 percent above the national average. What of the longer term? California faces serious problems, not the least of which is the energy mess, which has exacerbated the current slowdown. Our recovery will probably lag several quarters behind the rest of the country. But the long-term picture is brighter. Information technologies have brought about permanent productivity improvements and transformed virtually every major industry in the so-called "old economy." Such enhancements will themselves result in renewed information technology spending, if not at the frenetic pace of the late 1990s. The main concern is whether California will degenerate into an even more anti-business climate. We are already viewed by the business community as an overtaxed, over-regulated state. Gov. Gray Davis' rhetoric, and some of his actions, during the energy debacle have only added to the impression. While Davis deserves credit for using the bully pulpit to encourage energy conservation, his demagogic attacks on "outside" energy companies, and the suggestion that California should go it alone, are not only poor policy solutions but suggest a degree of economic illiteracy on his part. His plan to have the state play an expanded role in energy production and transportation will require the expenditure of billions of dollars. Do we believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely, efficiently and devoid of politics? California would be better off if the governor got out of the energy business. The state will also continue to pay for the financial mishandling of the energy situation. The initial refusal by Davis' appointees on the Public Utilities Commission to allow utilities to enter long-term contracts worsened the shortages and sharpened the price spikes. Then, at the peak of the market frenzy, the governor's office negotiated long term contracts that lock the state into paying unnecessarily high prices. And by keeping prices to consumers unrealistically controlled, he has passed the burden for energy costs on to the taxpayers -- current and future. With all the problems and missteps, however, there is great reason to be optimistic about California's economic future. We are still a beacon of opportunity. We still attract the best and the brightest. We are still the best incubator of new ideas and businesses. However, our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for granted. With better state policy -- lower tax rates, less regulation, reforms to improve our schools, and a more efficient energy and transportation infrastructure -- California will reemerge as the leader of a strong national economy, providing opportunity, mobility and still higher standards of living.

 Quick add on to Sue's note:  Right now, appears they're focused on the budget, but could take up energy.

 Quick update to Jim's note:  Still appears that the Assembly only has enough left in it tonite to deal with the budget and then recess; and it is still unclear if they'll get enough Republicans to go along tonite, or be forced to come back tomorrow to try again. If the Legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing the energy issues, then decision-making on some key issues---Direct Access in particular---will fall back in the PUC's lap. (The Legislature is scheduled to be out until August 20th.) The PUC has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend DA, the rate agreement with DWR, DWR's rev. req. and other issues on August 23rd. PUC President Loretta Lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of August. As Jim points out, we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for Direct Access and cost allocation in both forums----the Legislature and the PUC.  Best, Jeff 
 The Assembly passed the budget late last night. The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill. There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a deal. For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early. The activity now moves to the PUC.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  Many similar stories in the major papers today. Best, Jeff Figures show state lost big on extra power Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001 BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month selling surplus electricity for less than it cost. The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts -- and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be needed. A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers. ``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, who requested details of the state's surplus power sales. ``The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more money.'' A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably is less. ``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimated number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources. Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher. The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month. State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left California holding more power than it needs. The revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer. Price that was paid The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold 178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the department said. Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost. A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a ``portfolio.'' Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour as well as cheaper spot-market buys. State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1. Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California's July purchases, which totaled $415 million. The $6.5 million from sales will help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity. ``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations,'' Hidalgo said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal operating procedure for any utility.'' Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, have said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a cost of doing business. The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging ``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy. `Best bid' taken Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find. ``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said. Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable. State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million this month, in part because the state has so much power.

 Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for years (Published July 24, 2001) The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn over internal documents. Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians. At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor suppliers to California. Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading data. Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction." Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands of class-action attorneys? Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that private lawyers are working closely with investigators. Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings, that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that ISO had ordered the plant operational changes. Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation. Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary. Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides. The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their utility bill checks.

 I think that it would be useful for Ken to join the call.  Your thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly members back.  So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make a run at this.  We are getting more information and mobilizing industry. Some key considerations:  The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something done. The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having "done nothing." Becauase the Assembly has thus far "done nothing," the only thing it has in front of it is 78. The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order to get the support necessary to get voted out. Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where the Senate would have to approve it. Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that Burton's inclined to come back. In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes to 78, that "it's 78 or nothing."  Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e., Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's amendments.  Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye on the issues. All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be counted out.  We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could move. Will report back as information becomes available. Best, Jeff    "Scott Govenar" <sgovenar@govadv.com> 07/24/2001 05:15 PM Please respond to sgovenar

 Interesting points.  However, I don't ever recall you agreeing with every Commission decision on disallowances.  And I know you wouldn't establish differing standards for IOUs and state water agencies.  I just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg.  You really think that Campbell is a dim bulb?

 Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version of an "Edison MOU":  The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet that the Assembly would not convene on Friday. He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until they get back from recess on the 20th of August. The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess. From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.  The proposal: Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance) Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing). Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly) Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.) Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to the one created in Texas). The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new version of 82XX.  The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest proposal. If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly version. Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for recess as soon as we hear.  Best, Jeff

 Just got a call from Hertzberg. He pulled the plug last night on trying to get an Edison MOU finished by this weekend. Too complicated; too rushed; he couldn't pull it off, but intends to continue working with folks. He said that likelihood now is that the Assembly will recess, come back on the 20th, and try again. Since the Legislature has adjourned without resolving the Edison/energy issue, the focus will now be at the CPUC, which is scheduled to rule on a rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC, Direct Access suspension, etc. at its August 23rd meeting.  Best, Jeff  Please forward to anyone else who needs to receive this.

 Sue: Here's my shot at it.  Please add, subtract, multiply as you see fit. Thanks, Jeff  ****************************************************************************** **************** Got the California PUC to agree 1) not to place rate-cap related surcharges on Direct Access customers in SDG&E's service territory, and 2) not to impose 3 cent rate increase on DA customers in PG&E and Edison service territories. Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in California. Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron. Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California applies the "PX Credit" and 2) harmed EES' financial position. Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to implement the proposal in California. Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially sensitive information. Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a "demand buy-down" proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and 4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility. Worked with PR and Ken Lay to persuade California's business leaders to get involved in the effort to resolve California's energy crisis.

 Thanks, Hedy:  Not good. John White has a similar view, i.e., Loretta doesn't have many choices given that the Legislature hasn't executed.  John did say, however, that if we can provide the legal analysis to support doing something other than "suspend," Loretta is likely to be amenable.  Seems like it would be useful to try to get the analysis, assuming that  there's legal analysis to support an alternative to "suspend."  Hertzberg and I are trading calls.

 FYI.  Story on the effect of FERC prices on supply in PNW. Best, Jeff  Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  07/26/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter. The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana. "The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of having rotating outages in the region." About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power plant. The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could power about 45,000 homes. "You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said. After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%. But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot market. NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in Washington that could have added 300 megawatts. FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open market in the past few months. The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers. In addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower level. The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in half since the cap was first formulated in June.  Not Everyone Blames FERC  The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three months ago. Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's price controls have kept prices artificially low. A smaller group thinks the market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and consumers are conserving electricity. Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO) merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the cancellation of projects to price controls. "I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said. "The market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we will find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is sending now." The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two months. Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for a few hours so far this summer. "Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG. "The need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling." Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze. Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance. TransAlta is continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington, because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago. "The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed within the time frame we're talking about," said Dick Watson, a director with the Northwest Power Planning Council. Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap. Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity." As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six months. And orders for new generators have been canceled. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 Senior Director Enron Corp 
 5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests. JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS  07/28/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records. All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. "The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the law." Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing." The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. "We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. "I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. "I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns." Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended "I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. "We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters." "Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.  PHOTO: Barry Goode, above, governor's legal affairs secretary.; Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 Greetings Ms Dotty.  Hope you've managed to stay a night or two in your house recently.  Do you think that it would be OK to call your cousin in Sea Ranch?  I have some carpentry work I'd like done on my property (panel interior of cabin; build deck and gazebo) and thought I might get him, or someone who works for/with him, or someone he could recommend to help me out.  If you think he wouldn't mind having me call, might you have his phone number (and full name)?  As always, greatly appreciated.  FYI:  Just talked to the guy from UC Davis who's in the field for Mendocino County.  He says that by the sound of it, my property just might end up being vine-friendly!  All the best, Jeff 
 Well sometime between 11 PM last night and this morning, my computer died. However, I will nonetheless get a draft of the letter out today for discussion on tomorrow's call.  Given the glitch, it will likely be out by COB today.  Apologies for the delay.  Best, Jeff 
 Who would be attending? 
 FYI.  This is THE story out here today.  Given the repugnant things that Maviglio has said about Enron over the past several months, it will be very interesting to see whether he'll be able to withstand the fact that all the time that he was saying those things, he owned our stock.  Gee, couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  Best, Jeff  In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a very good thing for Direct Access. Davis spokesman under fire for stock By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writers (Published July 31, 2001) Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power plant. His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private finances and their public roles. Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices across the board." Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he had no control over the exact date of purchase. Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. "They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than any other generator." In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. "These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements to reflect current holdings. Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal prosecution. Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by insider-trading crackdowns. Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support construction. His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to build the plant. Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which he purchased in 1996. "I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at all." Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have used inside information to make his stock purchase. "Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy crisis. The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at $39.85. The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible violations of the law or close to it." "It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy for the state. "Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been hired," Knox said.

 FYI.  David Freeman and DWR....public power working for California. ******************************************************** Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate. By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published July 31, 2001) California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. "We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on the governing board of the Independent System Operator. The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers. Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't. "We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves confidential bidding behavior. But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. "We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's not necessarily a good fit." Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing output when demand doesn't match forecasts. Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a process the industry calls "decking." But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 a megawatt-hour. Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less than it paid, he said. Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for no good reason," Florio said. "The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because they're contracted with DWR," he said. Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting costs, Florio said. For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a smoother-running system in place by next summer.

 Hi.  Me again.  Thanks for all the help with the New York trip.  I have another question.  My family (four people) is going to Boston on September 2, returning to SF on September 9.  I noticed on United's website that they have round trip for about $365 and I was wondering if you folks can better that?

 Gouger Gray Davis California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not." Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a "melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality. Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 per megawatt hour. Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies. 
 plz call when u can. thx, jeff 415.782.7822 
 Thanks.  Looks like one thing good has happened for them today.  I don't think Maviglio will be able to stay.  Your thoughts?  I'm glad he made some money off of Enron stock.  (What a jerk.)  Also, we did file the amended complaint yesterday and the motion to quash will be filed today.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Govenar" <sgovenar@govadv.com> 07/31/2001 12:28 PM Please respond to sgovenar 
 You're a doll.  Thanks.  Hope to talk to you soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Sue:  I hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---I know that something invariably happens that creates havoc.  Good luck.  I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought I'd give you a quick update:  Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and install some facilities in California.  With some effort, we persuaded Scott that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced).  Instead, Scott's going to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the project entails.  Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame for approval would look like.  Scott agrees with this approach.  He's going to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland.  We likely will regroup to figure out "next steps" right after the first of the year.  Have any thoughts on this approach? I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings.  However, this Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area) have had a little "special  event" planned for the past 6 months. Consequently, I will have to miss the GA Xmas party, which I'm very disappointed about----I really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with everyone.  I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by phone.  Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule:  "Family and relationships first!"  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt =20   \ objattph=20 Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose= =20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterd= ay=20 denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up= =20 during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundre= ds=20 of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra=20 Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted= =20 those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to = be=20 owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are= =20 completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E= .=20 The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio= n=20 debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa= n=20 Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20 selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is= =20 that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20 SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20 actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher= =20 price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t= o=20 over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20 earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while= =20 publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham= es=20 said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20 detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state= =20 Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20 SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20 consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa= ny=20 had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was= =20 required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20 marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh= at=20 we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20 along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20 publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the= =20 Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,= =20 SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates= =20 during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal= =20 terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici= ty=20 to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold= =20 that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20 pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr= om=20 the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and= =20 billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici= ty=20 exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,= =20 it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20 million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with= =20 its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because= =20 the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's=20 shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses= =20 entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities= =20 Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,= =20 when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual=20 power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the= =20 commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra= =20 reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt= .=20 The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling a= nd=20 award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from= =20 selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession= =20 because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says= =20 the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocate= s=20 agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Se= n.=20 Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the= =20 balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and= =20 that's something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the=20 balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of= =20 the gains we've already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis= =20 did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations. = =20 Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists= =20 demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager= =20 for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG= &E=20 has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission=20 rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the= =20 scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they= =20 were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to= =20 split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from= =20 sales,' is disingenuous."

"It (the application) is ver= y=20 detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort=20 before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in= =20 the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20 partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ= ia=20 Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take= =20 three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20 industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the= =20 idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20 plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and= =20 the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest= =20 median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to se= e=20 what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with= =20 Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with m= e=20 I've been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant= =20 would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state.

Lehane issued a statement through= =20 the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge= =20 the controller in court."

GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry. By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS  July 31 2001  The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry= =20 into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20 information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat= e,=20 a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.  The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20 response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20 Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants= =20 may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20 information not available to the public.  On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be= en=20 fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a= nd=20 their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20 capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20 about who in the administration owns energy stocks.  Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20 Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company= =20 he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h= as=20 been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20 Enron Corp. in 1996.  "It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.  He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20 largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.  Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's= =20 mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th= e=20 governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio= n=20 was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a= =20 value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.  "I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he= =20 purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available= =20 information.  The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms= =20 that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20 California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy= =20 merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.  The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from= =20 several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.  Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20 Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held= =20 between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of= =20 multimillion-dollar price gouging.  In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte= r=20 he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were= =20 supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20 failed to do so.  In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20 governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.  "The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20 conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20 activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said= =20 Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.  Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20 governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and= =20 broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20 crisis.  In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur= e=20 documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two= =20 energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20 possibility of insider trading.  State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the= ir=20 personal financial interests.  The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,= =20 delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not= =20 clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the= =20 agency's review would result in any charges.  Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by= =20 federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider= =20 trading.  But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his= =20 colleagues owned Calpine stock.  Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende= d=20 it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20 now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20 traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.  Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20 March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow= er=20 for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders= =20 Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20 their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to = be=20 filed only two weeks ago.  "But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,= =20 because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20 hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."  Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two= =20 weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20 securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor= e=20 leaving her state job.  Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i= n=20 individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto= ck=20 Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a= =20 good investment.  "I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.= =20 "We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."  As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20 state, but only at market prices.  Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi= s=20 image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,= =20 have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court= =20 settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.  Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said= =20 the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for= =20 communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.  "Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.= =20 Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor= ,=20 to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20 consulting business with the governor."  As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20 Monday morning.  Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle= en=20 Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus= e=20 of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20 financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro= m=20 Davis and the Legislature.

Gouger Gray Davis=20 California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electrici= ty  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the Sa= n=20 Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit= h=20 regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nic= e=20 publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been=20 unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this=20 optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th= at=20 out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha= s=20 been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20 generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th= is=20 amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee= n=20 state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's= =20 chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug= e=20 overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20 generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20 perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the= =20 state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20 where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."= =20 Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin= g=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and= =20 the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked= =20 for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,= =20 Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20 "melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20 Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20 released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power=20 companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the=20 average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.= =20 California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles= =20 Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District= =20 (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state= =20 generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping= =20 boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33= 0=20 per megawatt hour.=20 Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20 spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators= =20 who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that= =20 are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off= =20 by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."=20 Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i= t=20 turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business=20 consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion = in=20 ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The= =20 state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the= =20 current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state= =20 power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high price= s=20 are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set t= o=20 eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper powe= r.=20 Who's the real gouger?

Gray Davis has begged= ,=20 cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo= rk=20 for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin= g=20 its lights on.=20 Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti= ve=20 investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20 battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc= e=20 back from a rocky start.=20 This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20 scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which= =20 would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed= ,=20 Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political= =20 infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t= o=20 satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti= er=20 investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20 without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial= =20 headaches for decades to come.=20 "This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20 Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."= =20 That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and= =20 credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb= t=20 investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a= s=20 long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers= =20 from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.= =20 Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will= =20 be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20 private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20 Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20 succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20 originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy= =20 crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th= e=20 price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ= er=20 in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission= =20 to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin= g=20 blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20 Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies= =20 are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20 disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System= =20 and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor= s=20 Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently= =20 as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three= =20 months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court=20 protection.=20 By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early Novembe= r,=20 the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a tot= al=20 of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond= =20 issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops,=20 California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts,=20 raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past ye= ar=20 to pay back what it owes.=20 If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble,"= =20 says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20 education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20 California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --= =20 stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,= =20 the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow= er=20 plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore= d=20 power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20 The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20 soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.= =20 Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from = $7=20 billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20 billion.=20 With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and= =20 Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20 dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business= =20 with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow= ed=20 the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from= =20 public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, = at=20 a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20 In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a= =20 bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20 continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size= =20 of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula= =20 would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20 Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20 another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to= =20 $13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake= rs=20 banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to= =20 immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20 mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20 In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving= =20 four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine= d=20 a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi= ng=20 moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.= =20 At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow= n"=20 their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin= g=20 a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou= p=20 Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t= o=20 charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20 issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $= 56=20 million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees= =20 won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20 structure.=20 From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem= ed=20 fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to= =20 explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h= is=20 blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi= s=20 only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's= =20 Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes= =20 before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th= e=20 state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20 During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20 conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20 director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not= =20 getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20 "It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, = a=20 Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't= =20 recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A= =20 spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20 Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20 investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike= =20 system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.= =20 But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20 Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers= ,=20 turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response= =20 to one of his answers.=20 Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f= or=20 example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20 Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless= =20 it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by= =20 February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20 claims "completely" political.=20 California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger= =20 pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,= =20 "and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors= =20 know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby= =20 added.=20 Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the= =20 Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20 former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc= e=20 calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th= at=20 California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that= =20 "the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few= =20 months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc= .=20 Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t= o=20 make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue= =20 set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,= =20 the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20 purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20 raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20 decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20 utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20 consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice= =20 directly from generators or traders.=20 But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh= t.=20 Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might= =20 get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU= C=20 decision before the state Supreme Court.=20 California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.= =20 Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p= er=20 kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares= =20 with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag= o,=20 but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20 High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy= =20 electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to=20 eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price o= f=20 electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," say= s=20 Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20 The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr= a=20 Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest= =20 possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20 example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai= m=20 that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20 utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai= ls=20 and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20 Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th= at=20 could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face=20 another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power=20 contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved= =20 get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who= =20 are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20 In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i= s=20 expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal=20 issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president = of=20 Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20 individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to= =20 participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. = "I=20 don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds.=20 Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20 energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were goin= g=20 south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems,"= =20 says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in= =20 San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also= =20 worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20 To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20 billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure= =20 that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments= =20 in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20 through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues= =20 from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the= =20 bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of=20 Standard & Poor's state and local government group.=20 It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrul= e=20 state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge cou= ld=20 rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's=20 creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a= =20 wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if = it=20 ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection.=20 Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by=20 chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors.

Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio= n=20 long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20 energy market. Here's the real story:=20 Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state= =20 generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.= =20 This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November= ,=20 it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati= on=20 gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ= y=20 purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20 billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state= =20 budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass= =20 the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to= =20 issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20 In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout= s=20 rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia= te=20 long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20 long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at= =20 the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The= =20 cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug= e=20 glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20 construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20 resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate= =20 the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of= =20 three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in= =20 the long-term energy contracts.=20 To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse= s.=20 Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20 redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20 bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract= s=20 that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly= =20 objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of= =20 environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the= =20 generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b= y=20 the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over= =20 the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20 Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our= =20 energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer= =20 has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20 recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20 Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20 cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20 The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California= =20 still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity= =20 costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20 businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th= e=20 state's economic growth.=20 There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is t= o=20 have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the= =20 Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making=20 authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.      Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20 By Rebecca Smith  07/31/2001=20 The Wall Street Journal=20 Page A3=20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20 Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means= =20 that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost= =20 of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20 Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20 equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20 contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile= =20 and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe= r,=20 and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric= e=20 it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio= n=20 to $35 million.=20 The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,= =20 the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20 electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing= =20 business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned= =20 utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since= =20 then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much = as=20 20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it= =20 was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20 Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month= =20 of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you= 'd=20 expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"= =20 said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20 Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on= =20 average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for= =20 some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an= d=20 $148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas= ed=20 under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20 excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27= =20 per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t= he=20 DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20 This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat= e=20 was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at= =20 times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly= =20 power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20 obligations.=20 Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow= n=20 substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 = by=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20 factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International= ,=20 sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting= =20 energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20 Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average= =20 cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i= s=20 more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices= =20 averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen= cy=20 $1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the= =20 huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is= =20 pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i= ts=20 coffers.=20 The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed = by=20 federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.= =20 So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3= 6=20 billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20 purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20 But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, ha= s=20 at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last=20 Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per= =20 megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot=20 market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the= =20 actual shape of demand.=20 John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a= =20 big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his= =20 company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resource= s=20 agency for power the company otherwise would generate.

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt =20   \ objattph=20 Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose= =20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterd= ay=20 denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up= =20 during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundre= ds=20 of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra=20 Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted= =20 those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to = be=20 owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are= =20 completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E= .=20 The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio= n=20 debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa= n=20 Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20 selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is= =20 that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20 SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20 actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher= =20 price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t= o=20 over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20 earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while= =20 publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham= es=20 said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20 detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state= =20 Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20 SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20 consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa= ny=20 had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was= =20 required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20 marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh= at=20 we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20 along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20 publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the= =20 Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,= =20 SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates= =20 during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal= =20 terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici= ty=20 to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold= =20 that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20 pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr= om=20 the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and= =20 billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici= ty=20 exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,= =20 it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20 million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with= =20 its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because= =20 the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's=20 shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses= =20 entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities= =20 Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,= =20 when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual=20 power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the= =20 commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra= =20 reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt= .=20 The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling a= nd=20 award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from= =20 selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession= =20 because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says= =20 the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocate= s=20 agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Se= n.=20 Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the= =20 balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and= =20 that's something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the=20 balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of= =20 the gains we've already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis= =20 did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations. = =20 Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists= =20 demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager= =20 for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG= &E=20 has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission=20 rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the= =20 scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they= =20 were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to= =20 split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from= =20 sales,' is disingenuous."

Sempra Energy Resources will file a= =20 200-page application with the city Planning Department for a 550-megawatt,= =20 natural gas-fired power plant and roughly 100-acre business park in southwe= st=20 Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is ver= y=20 detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort=20 before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in= =20 the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20 partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ= ia=20 Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take= =20 three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20 industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the= =20 idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20 plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and= =20 the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest= =20 median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to se= e=20 what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with= =20 Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with m= e=20 I've been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant= =20 would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The compa= ny=20 also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapo= r=20 plume such as the one produced by the city's Iceoplex generating plant.  Th= e=20 plant and park are slated for Quail Hills, the last large parcel of vacant= =20 industrial land in the city. Several previous plans by other developers hav= e=20 failed after they discovered the high costs involved with building on the= =20 hilly terrain.

Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock =20   \ objattph=20 ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 31, 2001  SACRAMENTO =01) Gov. Gray Davis' press=20 secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as five consultants the= =20 governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday.  Steve Maviglio confirmed th= at=20 on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-base= d=20 power generator that has received about $13 billion in state contracts to= =20 supply electricity for up to 20 years.  Maviglio's disclosure comes after= =20 Davis' office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped=20 negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies.  In a= =20 related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Mond= ay=20 that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary=20 inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the= =20 energy stocks.  About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to= =20 fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of=20 interest by Republicans and consumer groups.

Maviglio defended his=20 purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in companies in all fields th= at=20 are growing and are based in California."

Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the=20 settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing.  Lehane issued a statement through= =20 the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge= =20 the controller in court."  Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of= =20 Lehane, former press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a= =20 deputy campaign manager for Gore's presidential run.

GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry. By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS  July 31 2001  The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry= =20 into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20 information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat= e,=20 a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.  The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20 response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20 Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants= =20 may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20 information not available to the public.  On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be= en=20 fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a= nd=20 their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20 capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20 about who in the administration owns energy stocks.  Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20 Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company= =20 he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h= as=20 been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20 Enron Corp. in 1996.  "It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.  He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20 largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.  Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's= =20 mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th= e=20 governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio= n=20 was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a= =20 value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.  "I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he= =20 purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available= =20 information.  The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms= =20 that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20 California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy= =20 merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.  The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from= =20 several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.  Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20 Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held= =20 between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of= =20 multimillion-dollar price gouging.  In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte= r=20 he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were= =20 supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20 failed to do so.  In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20 governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.  "The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20 conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20 activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said= =20 Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.  Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20 governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and= =20 broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20 crisis.  In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur= e=20 documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two= =20 energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20 possibility of insider trading.  State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the= ir=20 personal financial interests.  The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,= =20 delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not= =20 clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the= =20 agency's review would result in any charges.  Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by= =20 federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider= =20 trading.  But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his= =20 colleagues owned Calpine stock.  Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende= d=20 it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20 now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20 traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.  Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20 March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow= er=20 for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders= =20 Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20 their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to = be=20 filed only two weeks ago.  "But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,= =20 because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20 hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."  Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two= =20 weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20 securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor= e=20 leaving her state job.  Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i= n=20 individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto= ck=20 Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a= =20 good investment.  "I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.= =20 "We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."  As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20 state, but only at market prices.  Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi= s=20 image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,= =20 have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court= =20 settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.  Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said= =20 the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for= =20 communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.  "Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.= =20 Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor= ,=20 to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20 consulting business with the governor."  As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20 Monday morning.  Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle= en=20 Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus= e=20 of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20 financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro= m=20 Davis and the Legislature.  Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with= =20 Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the= =20 outcome of the lawsuit.  Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a mon= th=20 for six months.  Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.  *  Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia Ellis in Sacramento and Robert= =20 J.

Gouger Gray Davis=20 California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electrici= ty  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the Sa= n=20 Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit= h=20 regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nic= e=20 publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been=20 unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this=20 optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th= at=20 out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha= s=20 been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20 generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th= is=20 amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee= n=20 state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's= =20 chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug= e=20 overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20 generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20 perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the= =20 state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20 where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."= =20 Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin= g=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and= =20 the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked= =20 for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,= =20 Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20 "melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20 Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20 released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power=20 companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the=20 average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.= =20 California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles= =20 Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District= =20 (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state= =20 generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping= =20 boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33= 0=20 per megawatt hour.=20 Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20 spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators= =20 who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that= =20 are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off= =20 by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."=20 Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i= t=20 turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business=20 consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion = in=20 ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The= =20 state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the= =20 current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state= =20 power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high price= s=20 are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set t= o=20 eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper powe= r.=20 Who's the real gouger?

Gray Davis has begged= ,=20 cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo= rk=20 for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin= g=20 its lights on.=20 Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti= ve=20 investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20 battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc= e=20 back from a rocky start.=20 This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20 scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which= =20 would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed= ,=20 Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political= =20 infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t= o=20 satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti= er=20 investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20 without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial= =20 headaches for decades to come.=20 "This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20 Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."= =20 That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and= =20 credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb= t=20 investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a= s=20 long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers= =20 from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.= =20 Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will= =20 be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20 private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20 Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20 succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20 originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy= =20 crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th= e=20 price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ= er=20 in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission= =20 to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin= g=20 blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20 Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies= =20 are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20 disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System= =20 and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor= s=20 Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently= =20 as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three= =20 months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court=20 protection.=20 By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early Novembe= r,=20 the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a tot= al=20 of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond= =20 issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops,=20 California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts,=20 raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past ye= ar=20 to pay back what it owes.=20 If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble,"= =20 says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20 education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20 California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --= =20 stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,= =20 the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow= er=20 plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore= d=20 power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20 The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20 soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.= =20 Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from = $7=20 billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20 billion.=20 With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and= =20 Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20 dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business= =20 with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow= ed=20 the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from= =20 public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, = at=20 a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20 In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a= =20 bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20 continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size= =20 of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula= =20 would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20 Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20 another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to= =20 $13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake= rs=20 banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to= =20 immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20 mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20 In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving= =20 four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine= d=20 a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi= ng=20 moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.= =20 At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow= n"=20 their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin= g=20 a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou= p=20 Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t= o=20 charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20 issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $= 56=20 million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees= =20 won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20 structure.=20 From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem= ed=20 fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to= =20 explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h= is=20 blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi= s=20 only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's= =20 Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes= =20 before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th= e=20 state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20 During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20 conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20 director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not= =20 getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20 "It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, = a=20 Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't= =20 recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A= =20 spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20 Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20 investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike= =20 system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.= =20 But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20 Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers= ,=20 turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response= =20 to one of his answers.=20 Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f= or=20 example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20 Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless= =20 it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by= =20 February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20 claims "completely" political.=20 California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger= =20 pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,= =20 "and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors= =20 know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby= =20 added.=20 Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the= =20 Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20 former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc= e=20 calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th= at=20 California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that= =20 "the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few= =20 months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc= .=20 Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t= o=20 make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue= =20 set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,= =20 the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20 purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20 raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20 decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20 utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20 consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice= =20 directly from generators or traders.=20 But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh= t.=20 Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might= =20 get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU= C=20 decision before the state Supreme Court.=20 California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.= =20 Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p= er=20 kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares= =20 with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag= o,=20 but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20 High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy= =20 electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to=20 eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price o= f=20 electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," say= s=20 Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20 The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr= a=20 Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest= =20 possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20 example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai= m=20 that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20 utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai= ls=20 and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20 Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th= at=20 could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face=20 another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power=20 contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved= =20 get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who= =20 are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20 In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i= s=20 expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal=20 issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president = of=20 Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20 individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to= =20 participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. = "I=20 don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds.=20 Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20 energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were goin= g=20 south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems,"= =20 says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in= =20 San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also= =20 worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20 To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20 billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure= =20 that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments= =20 in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20 through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues= =20 from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the= =20 bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of=20 Standard & Poor's state and local government group.=20 It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrul= e=20 state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge cou= ld=20 rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's=20 creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a= =20 wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if = it=20 ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection.=20 Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by=20 chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors. There= =20 will be taxable, tax-free, variable-interest, fixed-interest, short-term an= d=20 long-term bonds. State Finance Director Tim Gage says the state is assuming= a=20 rating "in the range of single-A" on the power bonds and thus expects to pa= y=20 an average annual interest rate of 5.77% on the tax-exempt issue and 7.77% = on=20 the taxable bonds.=20 Investors and analysts "may think we're crazy," says Guy Phillips, one of t= he=20 state's top legislative aides on energy matters, "But in the end, the=20 decision for them is: `Do we see a path to get our money.'"=20 ---=20 Journal Link: Would you purchase California bonds that are backed by utilit= y=20 payments?

Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio= n=20 long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20 energy market. Here's the real story:=20 Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state= =20 generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.= =20 This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November= ,=20 it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati= on=20 gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ= y=20 purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20 billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state= =20 budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass= =20 the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to= =20 issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20 In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout= s=20 rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia= te=20 long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20 long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at= =20 the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The= =20 cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug= e=20 glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20 construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20 resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate= =20 the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of= =20 three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in= =20 the long-term energy contracts.=20 To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse= s.=20 Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20 redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20 bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract= s=20 that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly= =20 objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of= =20 environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the= =20 generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b= y=20 the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over= =20 the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20 Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our= =20 energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer= =20 has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20 recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20 Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20 cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20 The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California= =20 still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity= =20 costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20 businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th= e=20 state's economic growth.=20 There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is t= o=20 have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the= =20 Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making=20 authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.      Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20 By Rebecca Smith  07/31/2001=20 The Wall Street Journal=20 Page A3=20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20 Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means= =20 that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost= =20 of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20 Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20 equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20 contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile= =20 and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe= r,=20 and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric= e=20 it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio= n=20 to $35 million.=20 The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,= =20 the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20 electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing= =20 business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned= =20 utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since= =20 then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much = as=20 20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it= =20 was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20 Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month= =20 of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you= 'd=20 expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"= =20 said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20 Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on= =20 average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for= =20 some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an= d=20 $148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas= ed=20 under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20 excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27= =20 per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t= he=20 DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20 This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat= e=20 was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at= =20 times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly= =20 power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20 obligations.=20 Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow= n=20 substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 = by=20 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20 factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International= ,=20 sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting= =20 energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20 Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average= =20 cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i= s=20 more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices= =20 averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen= cy=20 $1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the= =20 huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is= =20 pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i= ts=20 coffers.=20 The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed = by=20 federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.= =20 So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3= 6=20 billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20 purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20 But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, ha= s=20 at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last=20 Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per= =20 megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot=20 market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the= =20 actual shape of demand.=20 John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a= =20 big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his= =20 company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resource= s=20 agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to= =20 resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what= =20 the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout= .=20 (Chart)
