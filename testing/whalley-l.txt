 i'm sorry that i did not call you on friday with my credit card number to secure this charter.  i will call in the morning. 
 Rick,  I was able to speak w/Greg and Mike McConnell on your Napa Valley conference.  Unfortunately, Greg nor Mike are able to attend.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 Don,  Greg would love to see you.  What about lunch on the 13th?  (He's in PRC all day on the 12th)  Lets say 11:30a.m.   We're located at EB2801.  Take Care,  Liz 
 i would be happy to meet with him, but i need to know exactly when because my september schedule is pretty ugly.  we have talked with rappaport about their eNymex project, but they do seem to be struggling for strategy.  it is really surprising that they lost money.  how did it happen?  volume couldn't have been down, given all the volatility. 
 Sounds like a good idea to me 
 it might be a reasonable idea, as long as it isn't a weekly event 
 Mr. Nimocks,  Greg has decided that he would like to do the 90-minute panel.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor 
 what do you know about this company?  i can get a meeting with the CEO.  they recently bought APL stacktrain unit to become fully intermodal.  i also think they are moving toward IPO. 
 Iain,  First, thank you for being so helpful with me on the phone.  Below is the information you requested for the Whalley home fax machine.  I would love to meet w/you to discuss an updated fax machine for Greg's at home office.   Greg & Mary Whalley 11110 Claymore Street Houston, TX  77024  (Memorial/Voss area off Hedwidg) HM#713-465-1641  The repair person can come any time tomorrow, Wednesday, 8/30.  However, a.m. works better for Mary Whalley.  Please give me a call when the rep. is scheduled to go out.  The machine is jamming and eating paper.  HP Office Jet Model #45W - MAX 50-60HZ 
 i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out? 
 Mr. Nimocks,  Greg has committed to participate in the conference.  Give me until end-of-day tomorrow, for a format preference.  Many Thanks,  Liz

 on my current trip request #382 it looks like someone is bidding it as a one way trip instead of a round trip.  can you check? 
 Mr. Nimocks,  How long are you wanting Greg to speak?  What's the format for the presentations?  Will there be a Q& A after the presentation?  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.  The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.  Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO position.
