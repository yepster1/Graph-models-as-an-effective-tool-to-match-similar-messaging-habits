 As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way= . =20 August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th= e=20 commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kick-off of the= =20 company wide drive.

While these are aggressive goals,= they=20 are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we can easil= y=20 surpass these goals.=20  Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100= %=20 participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20 among our executives.

 would gladly take a couple of cases 
 Deborah,  When I met last w/you, Bill, and others, it was stated that Fastow's group was scheduled to move off floor 27 the weekend of 8/25.  I have just heard that they are not moving off until 9/8?  Is this the case?  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 i have kept in touch with Gildea and Brechbuhl.  i didn't really know Eckberg very well.  Powell is now an FCC commissioner, though i haven't kept in touch with him either.  i don't know if you remember james conforti, but i recently saw gildea and brechbuhl at his wedding in february.  give me a call when you get a chance.  my extension is 35220.  greg 
 Brad,  You're scheduled to meet  w/Greg on Wednesday at 3:30p.m. in EB2801b.  It was great seeing you and welcome back!  Liz 
 yes i am.  are you working here at enron? 
 your talking to the wrong person.   Liz actually controls the tickets.  take them if they are available, but i won't be able to go.  how long are you going to be in houston? 
 we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team. he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward your message to him.  thanks for the heads up  greg 
 just thought i'd send this your way. 
 sorry about that,  i forgot that the options are held in that book.  i dont have any questions. 
 Bruce,  Greg Whalley would like to speak with you on tomorrow, Wednesday, June 28. Please give me a call tomorrow to schedule a time to talk w/Greg.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 Joe,  I'm meeting w/Greg today about you.  I'll call you this afternoon or tomorrow morning.  Liz 
 Janette,  No worries.  The staff meeting has been canceled for today.  Liz 
 i called this guy and will give you an update.  i may try to see him next week in london. 
 Brad,  Greg asked that I drop you a line to apologize for not getting back with you as of yet.  He's running a bit behind on things.  Please look for a call from him  on tomorrow, Friday, June 2.  It was good seeing you again.  Take Care.  Liz Taylor 713-853-1935 Liz.M.Taylor@enron.com

 I do think that more of the trades will ultimately have to be changed, but no one else has said anything yet.

 Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit. Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger. 
 Kristin,  Per Greg Whalley, we need to install the Executive Report Viewer on Dave Delainey's computer.  He should have access to everything that Whalley has. Approval, for now, will remain with Whalley.  Greg would like this taken care of ASAP.  Many Thanks,  Liz
