 Jessica,  Am I outstanding an expense reimb. from you?  I seemed to be approx. $6000.00 past due and I have my check from the trading floor.  Please advise.  Many Thanks,  Liz 
 Mr. Bodily,  I was able to speak w/Greg this morning and I regret to inform you that he will not be able to join your class via video conference on April 3rd as we had previously hoped.  Greg will have to leave Houston for some of our overseas offices beginning April 2nd for approx. two weeks (London, Tokyo & Sydney).  I do apologize for the short notice, but these things tend to happen quickly, and with little or no notice.  Please provide me with some possible future dates during the month of May and I will discuss them with Greg.  Liz Taylor Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley 
 Thanks,  Cindy,  Can you copy me  also.  Greg does not check his emails regularly.  Thanks,  Liz 
 thanks for seeing him 
 Christie,  Greg has a conf. on his calendar during the period of May 9.  Let me check w/him to see if he really plans on attending the conf.  Liz 
 do we know the categories and nominees? 
 Do you have it now? 
 Christie,  Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could work out fine, it that's not too late.  Liz 
 would you have any interest? 
 Hi Richard,  Per my voicemail, are you available for at least an hour to meet w/Greg Whalley while he is in London?  He is wide open on Thursday.  Please advise.  Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor - E.A. to Greg Whalley 
 i'm certainly not opposed to training, but how does a weakly written review lead to an age discrimination claim? 
 here we go ............... 
 does it get any uglier than this? 
 call mark tawney.  we do occasionally make markets in precipitation. 
 Okay 
 the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a big plane.
