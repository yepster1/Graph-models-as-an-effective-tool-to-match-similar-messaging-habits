d file for the correct prices and months.  Charlie 
 Here are the updated curves as of last nights close.  Let me know if you need anything else.   Charlie 
 John,  Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.  The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:  1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.  2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.  3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.  Let me know if you have any further questions.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is due to our analysis and advice.  I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?  As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.  Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.  Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?   Later,  Charlie 
 Thanks!

 I believe that I inadvertently added the trading calendar request to my other e-requests.  You may consider my request withdrawn.  Thanks,  V. Charles Weldon 
 Sorry I did not get to call last night.  I'll try tonight after 8:00.  Can you please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-6666 and update my address? Your duplicate statements have been going to my old address in Austin.  My new address is 13006 Brayton Court, Houstno, TX 77065.  You will also need to sell $2000 of stocks in your Bidwell account and make your 2001 IRA  contribution to this IRA account as we have done the last several years.  We'll talk about what to sell later.  Love,  Charlie 
 The taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell.  It will be much less than $2000.  For instance, if we bought $1500 of Enron stock that is noe worth $2000 then you will only pay tax on the $500 gain. I'll look at it tonight. 
 got my money back..   i offerred 2 at 3-1/8 and they were gone in 5 minutes now I'm playing with profit and can let em ride. 
 She hasn't heard it yet as she was feeling so bad yesterday.  I'll take the pix tonight and see if I can get a CD done.   I'll get the invitation next time I can bare to be around you. 
 1816?  I have no idea. 
 I knew there was such a year but did not know which one 
 No problme.  I enjoy helping out.  Just tell them to send you $2000.  You should have at least that in cash.  If there is any extra leftover and you need the cash, you might as well take it too but that's up to you.  Enron is up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today.  Love,  Charlie 
 Thanks Kevin.  It has been very rewarding working here.   You are truly a valuable asset to this company and I appreciate all your help and efficiency.  Charlie 
 Loftus,  Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 This should be in your Enron Favorites: http://enaresearch.dev.corp.enron.com/research/framework/default.asp  Select FX and Sovereign Risk on the dropdown box and then go to US Calendar. The Global Markets Monitor link  is also good.

 As long as you have $2000, you're fine. How many Merck shares do you have left, is it just a fraction? 
 I think so but if not we'll just leave them in there. 
 I have a meeting in Cuero at 10:00 am this Saturday that will last only an hour or so.  Other than that, we have no reason to go.  Maybe you could fly me to that? If so, I'll need to ask Melissa.  She would not haev to go in that case and can stay and recuperate. 
 I need to check with Melissa first.  I'll call her now. 
 Hold off on the reservations as I cannot get hold of her.  She may want to drive for another reason I don't know of.  How long would we have to decide if we did want to fly.  Also, could Melissa and Hunter go also. 
 Here's a link to the data.  I'll come over there and show you where it is exactly  http://gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp 
 I'm going to get some scanned shortly.  Didn't get the CD. 
 Can there not be an argument made to dive into TXN?  It's trading at 25 forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.  A PEG of ~1 on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, right?  What's your view?  The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting.  Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.  This could be a "buy while there is blood in the streets" opportunity. 
 Ok.  I'm in a class the last two days so E-mail access is limited.  Looks like rain tomorrow so i doubt flying will work, huh?  I'll call you this evening.  I'll be on this e-mail for 5 more minutes. 
 I'm in Deriv 3 class.  I just sold my remaining 2 contracts @4 3/8.  NOt too bad 
 I have a link that looks like a lightbulb on my Lotus notes desktop.  If you don't have it, talk to your assistant.  I'll call you at lunch or on monday 
 Date is supposed to be Feb. 1  !!! 
 We likely will come unless we are still too sick.  We've all still got the "crud".  I'll call tomorrow evening and let you know.  Melissa said that she could/would make a "Football" cake if you want.  Just let me know when I call as I will not get any more e-mails today.  Thanks! 
 Thanks for the evening.  We had a good time and your kitchen looks great!  Love,  Charlie

 Sounds like Goldman has a pretty low opinion of Dupont's management.  not surprising..... 
 Yep.  If you are looking for a free trip to Austin, you should go to this. 
 This could be big...  http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010129/n29305829.html

 I finally awoke sometime later.  Our trip was pretty good but the game kinda sucked.  Try this link to see the latest cutting edge market that Enron is developing:  http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010129/tx_enron_b.html

 I 'm pretty sure that we made an equity investment in a fuel cell company but I'm not sure which one.  We have a group dedicated to looking at new energy technology investment opportunities so I'm confifdent we won't miss out on any opportunity in this market. 
 Thanks for the info.  The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or think she deserves so we appreciate it.  No need to send any more, really. If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present or something.  Are you going hunting this weekend?  It's going to be cold and probably wet so it should be perfect.  Charlie 
 I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.  Sorry about Jimmy.  He's having a heck of a time. 
 try this one...  http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010129/n29329725.html 
 I think I better stick around my new job for a little longer before I run off.  I've got a training class again next week so I'm going to be out 2 days.  I think I'm going to Austin in late Feb for the internship interviews. 
 That sounds good.  Thanks 
 $1 from you and $151 from Vikas on my MArch Nymex trade I closed today. Yeah!

 Here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects....  3.  Agricultural Modeling  In an effort to help the Financial Trading Group begin effectively trading = ag=20 commodities, we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop mode= l=20 to predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forward= =20 weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is high= ly=20 regarded in the agricultural modeling community.

Dr. Ritchie ahs expressed interest in= =20 providing assistance to us in setting up this software.  His new address is= =20 217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742. His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has=20 confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchie= =20 would be ideal for providing us the help that we need.  A second software product known as =01&Pcyield=018 has been suggested.  Pcy= ield is=20 based on the DSSAT model but is supposed to be more user friendly.  However= ,=20 Dr. Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is=20 probably the better fit for our needs.

 Kristin,  Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume whoever needs this info has one.  Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though)   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Andrew,  Note conference room for our meeting today.  I'm also attaching a brief writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.  You might want to review before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or misunderstanding :-)   )  of the deal currently is.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 I'm staying away from small caps.  Note their performance yesterday in light of apparently good news.
