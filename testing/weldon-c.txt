re is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000.  Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Mike,  The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.  We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Matt,  Doug Leach will be calling me in the morning to set up a brief meeting to discuss all the final details regarding purchase of the fuel oil for Ft. Pierce.  I believe that we have all the logistical matters addressed and all that is left to discuss is where and how exactly the charges for this purchase will flow.  In order to maximize communication and be sure that this issue is finally resolved, I am asking that you attend this meeting with us tomorrow morning.  Please let me know what your availability is.   Thanks!  Charlie 
 got it 
 Go it 
 Matt,  Two quick questions that Doug Leach needs answered ASAP to get the oil ordered:  1)  Name and number of contact person for handling the accounting/paperwork type issues at HD King plant.  2)  Name and number of contact person for logistic/scheduling issues at HD King plant.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Got it 
 Thanks Mike.  Would you mind providing the MW and heat rate assumptions that correspond to these flows just for information purposes.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Doug,  The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.  His phone number is 561-464-5792.  Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.  (He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us)   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Just want to remind everyone that the exact quantity is 202,000 gallons, isn't that right David? 
 Steve,  As of yesterday's curves, financial mid is 5.169 and physical mid is 5.311.  The physical Index premium is at TranscoZ6 is  ~.035 in summer and ~0.5 in winter.  Let me know if you need anything else.   Charlie 
 Thank you Doug!  Sorry this thing turned into such a mess along the way.  I appreciate the help you have given both me and the team.  Charlie 
 David,  Attached is a summary calculation of the net payment owed FPUA for the fuel oil transaction.  Please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Todd,  Attached is my resume per our conversation.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 I want to remain a member 
 Dutch,  Here's the quote sheet starting in August.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 FYI...... (and I'll provide the update he is requesting) 
 Are you staying? 
 Ed,  I'm interested in taking this course as I've heard it was pretty good.  I have applied to take it within the training system and it should be queued up for your approval if you support me taking it.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 John,  Thanks for the upate.  Sorry to hear this deal has been further delayed.  The updated gas price is 4.625 as of last night's curves.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 FYI...and thanks again! 
 FYI - There's also an opening on the Texas Gas Desk that may give me the opportunity to short-circuit the "required" rotations.  We'll see. 
 Slight problem,  can't get the room in 3 Allen center b/c they turn down the A/C on the weekend and need a cost code to cover any desired cooling.  Hence, we will likely end up in the Enron building in a less nice room but we'll manage.  VCW 
 June settled at 3.738.   No pressure to pay but wanted to document.  Later.... 
 Chris,  Attached are the prices you requested.  Please let me know if I can help you in any way, as we discussed.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Cool.  I'll set up a payment plan if you wish, with competitive rates.  :-) 
 Gracias 
 Attaached are the notional bids you requested.  Please contact me or Eric if you have any querstions .   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 MArk asked me to FW this to you 
 John,  Ignore the last message.  Kelli Little is going to look at your deal... 
 Rain is good.  I think Travis is coming to our house for a few days also.  Enron stock is a long story but we'll just all have to be patient.  I've been swamped.  Call you when I'm on the bus 
 Let's shoot for lunch next Tuesday.  Would one of you please contact me that a.m. to see how the day is going.  It's been pretty hectic lately but I think we will be able to do it.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 FYI 
 Desk is 3274D  Thanks 
 Joan,  Here are the basis numbers only.  Sorry this took so long. 
 FYI - A very good summary of the newly passed tax bill....   - Tax Bill CR 1.PDF - Tax Bill CR 2.PDF 
 Thanks! 
 Kelli took care of it.

 Team,  We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  Colin Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".  In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client"  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".  The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search  Sheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.  A word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provid
