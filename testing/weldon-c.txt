 Sounds like Goldman has a pretty low opinion of Dupont's management.  not surprising..... 
 Yep.  If you are looking for a free trip to Austin, you should go to this. 
 This could be big...  http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010129/n29305829.html

 I 'm pretty sure that we made an equity investment in a fuel cell company but I'm not sure which one.  We have a group dedicated to looking at new energy technology investment opportunities so I'm confifdent we won't miss out on any opportunity in this market. 
 Thanks for the info.  The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or think she deserves so we appreciate it.  No need to send any more, really. If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present or something.  Are you going hunting this weekend?  It's going to be cold and probably wet so it should be perfect.  Charlie 
 I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.  Sorry about Jimmy.  He's having a heck of a time. 
 try this one...  http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010129/n29329725.html 
 I think I better stick around my new job for a little longer before I run off.  I've got a training class again next week so I'm going to be out 2 days.  I think I'm going to Austin in late Feb for the internship interviews. 
 That sounds good.  Thanks 
 $1 from you and $151 from Vikas on my MArch Nymex trade I closed today. Yeah!

 Here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects....  3.  Agricultural Modeling  In an effort to help the Financial Trading Group begin effectively trading = ag=20 commodities, we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop mode= l=20 to predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forward= =20 weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is high= ly=20 regarded in the agricultural modeling community.  One of the primary author= s=20 of this software, Joe Ritchie, has recently retired from Michigan State=20 University and is moving to Texas.  Dr. Ritchie ahs expressed interest in= =20 providing assistance to us in setting up this software.  His new address is= =20 217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742. His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has=20 confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchie= =20 would be ideal for providing us the help that we need.  A second software product known as =01&Pcyield=018 has been suggested.  Pcy= ield is=20 based on the DSSAT model but is supposed to be more user friendly.  However= ,=20 Dr. Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is=20 probably the better fit for our needs.  The salesman for Pcyield is named= =20 Bill Bodine and he works for a company called Mpower 3.  He has indicated= =20 that he wants to visit us in Houston on February 2nd. 
 Kristin,  Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume whoever needs this info has one.  Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though)   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Andrew,  Note conference room for our meeting today.  I'm also attaching a brief writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.  You might want to review before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or misunderstanding :-)   )  of the deal currently is.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 I'm staying away from small caps.  Note their performance yesterday in light of apparently good news. 
 Investing, One Stock=20 =20 Broad Horizons=20 =20 by Jeff Schlegel=20 =20 December 2000, "Worth" magazine=20 =20 Energy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear= t=20 of the new economy.=20 =20 Enron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20 hates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company's= =20 downtown Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its= =20 haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy= =20 markets=20 were highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron's three= =20 commodity-trading floors =01* the company's nerve centers, where it buys an= d=20 sells products=20 ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20 often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the= =20 traders. "That's=20 how you find out what's going on," he says.  Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac= t=20 like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong= =20 online presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin= g=20 to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas= =20 and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20 industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20 insatiable demand,=20 has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and= =20 their customers. That suits Enron just fine.  New Economy Initiatives The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from= =20 its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful= =20 trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha= s=20 really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy= =20 initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi= ng=20 system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed= =20 more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20 Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both= =20 delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20 million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.  Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20 management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t= ap into new markets. "In five years, we will be a substantially different=20 company," says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. "Underlying=20 everything we=20 do is the ability to make markets more efficient." Along with bandwidth,=20 Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it= s=20 trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips= =20 and data storage. "Trading is the ultimate scalable concept," adds Skilling= .=20 "We're using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20 potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited."  Investors have bought into Enron's vision and sent its shares soaring, whic= h=20 at a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th= e=20 big question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20 Enron's stock price and what happens if the company's broadband strategy=20 doesn't=20 unfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.  "We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20 suited for the changing economy." =01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron  Company Culture Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20 management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20 revolutionary new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20 Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20 ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.  Management Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after= =20 the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,= =20 where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined= =20 forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti= es=20 could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract= s.=20 But=20 with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers= =20 and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating = a=20 trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the= =20 process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market= =20 in the 1990s.  Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc= h.=20 "Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known," sa= ys=20 Lay,=20 who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20 consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. "I've made it clea= r=20 for some time that he's my successor." The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall= y=20 joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu= l=20 but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.  Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20 bottom. "We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an= d=20 developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas," Lay says. Take Michae= l=20 Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton= =20 came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni= t=20 begins its operations later this year, he will run it.  Wholesale Energy Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is= =20 still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this= =20 year,=20 nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20 energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20 risk-management=20 products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr= om=20 its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is= =20 bought=20 from other energy producers with excess capacity.  The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20 EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.= =20 Margins are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt = of=20 electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just= =20 to=20 make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable = it=20 to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20 contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a= =20 principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of= =20 the product,=20 be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20 wholesale energy business average one to three percent.  Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette= r=20 than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri= ce=20 moves. "Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20 modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20 throughout=20 the country," says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund= s=20 who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20 meteorologists=20 on its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi= ng=20 cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th= at=20 could affect=20 supply and demand.  Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of= =20 deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20 Scandinavia=20 in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20 making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20 still loom large and=20 national differences present formidable hurdles. "We're the only company wi= th=20 pan-European operations," says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy unit. "There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20 difficult."  Broadband Operations The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20 bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ= y market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it= s=20 gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20 being deployed,=20 "the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in," says Kenneth= =20 Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. "Bandwidth lends itself well to bein= g=20 traded like=20 a commodity."  Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from= =20 carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then= =20 sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network= =20 carriers, and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and= =20 for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20 15,000 miles and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.  Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,= =20 which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer= s=20 into=20 paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20 demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period= s=20 of=20 time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o= f its=20 CEO to its offices around the globe.  The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20 monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o= n=20 a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at= a=20 speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20 quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20 months. Both Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20 annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener= gy=20 contributed=20 in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into= =20 broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending= =20 $2=20 billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).  The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering= =20 streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,= =20 along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran= ge=20 from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS= E:=20 BBI),=20 which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over= =20 Enron's network. "Video will be the king application," Skilling says. "That= 's=20 where=20 it's all going to happen."  Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million= =20 for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20 retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20 30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the= =20 stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100= =20 million in the process.  Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.= =20 businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei= r=20 operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything= =20 from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20 energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20 gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5= =20 billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate= =20 properties. "The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're= =20 going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail," says Marty Sunde, head of the group's North American unit.  Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu= t=20 sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20 in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings= =20 before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on= =20 target to=20 land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.= =20 "There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f= ew=20 years,"=20 Lay says.  "Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,= =20 but their track record warrants that." =01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham  The Competition Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t= he=20 deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications. Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a= nd=20 called "Enron Jr." by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20 electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The= =20 same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including= =20 Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20 energy-trading=20 system to rival EnronOnline.  Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang= e=20 (AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20 product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20 business,=20 Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona= l=20 utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope.  "It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20 always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations." =01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.  What It's Worth Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along= =20 its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20 also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha= t=20 to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business= es are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of= =20 $80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly= =20 valued at $5, wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at= =20 $15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale= =20 energy=20 is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20 year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And= =20 wholesale=20 energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t= he=20 next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20 markets.=20 Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and= =20 broadband,=20 not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli= ng=20 argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130.  Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20 higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i= s=20 still=20 a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith= =20 Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20 potential=20 of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the= =20 market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the= =20 mid-1990s. Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than= =20 Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value= =20 for bandwidth would make Enron a $100 stock.  Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20 Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea= r=20 =01* and maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth= $92.  Social Responsibility Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce= =20 methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But= =20 certain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant = in=20 India, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20 protests=20 against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20 Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th= e=20 suppression of dissent and didn't speak out against human rights violations= .=20 Enron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000 to improve the community's water and sanitation infrastructures.  The Upside With less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20 competition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie= ve=20 the entire=20 market will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20 expand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could= =20 get a=20 boost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:= =20 AOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via the Internet. Enron's attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi= a=20 ended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn't one of= =20 its strengths.=20 So it's relying on IBM's back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and= =20 AOL's Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.  The Downside The much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.= =20 Currently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called= =20 last-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving= =20 very=20 slowly. She doesn't expect wide-scale availability of video-on-demand befor= e=20 2004.  Who Needs It? Enron's mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most= =20 conservative investors. Its energy trading and pipeline businesses give it = a=20 stable source of cash flow, while its new Internet-based ventures give it t= he=20 great growth potential of a tech stock.  =20 =20

 This guy has amazingly good 20/20 hindsight.  He's painting the Fed as behind the times and inept at managing monetary policy in this New Economy.  In fact, it was Greenspan's willingness to embrace the New Economy's higher GDP "speed limit" and unemployment "floor" that enabled this unprecedented economic expansion.  While it is true that the Fed's tightening is largely responsible for this downturn, it is not solely responsible; and it is the Fed's nimbleness over the last month in reversing monetary policy that will prevent this downturn from being a mere bump in the road.

 I got my W-2 but I haven't looked into the impact of moving on income. 
 I think it is sad that he died but I 'm certainly fine.  He was pretty old and I really was not really close to him though, but he was a very nice and intelligent man.  About 8 years ago, I went to Utah on business with Dupont and I stayed over the weekend with him.  He took me all around Salt Lake City and showed me a bunch of neat stuff.  That's what I will remember about him most. 
 I'm in on Calpine.  Just bought. 
 I guess I would have shot him.  Look out for very cold temps by this weekend and next week.  Coldest in 4 years.

 Per Andrew, Let's plan on meeting (or at least touching base) on Thursday at 3:00.  I'm attaching a revised summary and a spreadsheet derived from the one Maria sent me on Monday.  Please take time to review both documents to see if we're still heading down the right path.... 
 Just fill out form and send $2000 in.  Contribution is for year 2001.  I've been real busy.

 It's Saturday.  Will that work? 
 Lunch is likely. Call me then 
 http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010206/tx_enron_a.html 
 Andrew,  Can we move tomorrow's meeting to 5:00 instead of 3:00?   I have a structuring class all day.  Mark will need to leave at ~5:30 so I'll try to be up here a little early if possible.  I'll send a nother note with a conference room if I can get one.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 I just bought some more CPN.  CEFT has a great 5 yr chart and doesn't seem too expensive but I don't understand their business risks as much as CPN so I'm going to stick with them.  I may give it some more thought if I could find a good research report on them. 
 I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell.  It was 20 miles west of Menard on Hwy 190.  A great area that's for sure.  Three deer have been killed on the ranch thatI know of so far:  1)  17", 10 point by Wayne Scroggins that grossed ~135 and is third largest ever on ranch.  Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs.  2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17", 11 point with a double main beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.  3) Travis shot a 16"  9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points.  We've seen more bucks than we have since '93.  More fawns than I ever remember.  Maybe things have turned around for awhile.  I've got some good videos I'll show sometime.  When are ya'll coming? 
 Let me know when the money is there and we will buy something 
 Files are located in Gas Structuring\LNG\Australia 
 I bought it at 41 and 42 ovver the last week and it's looking good.  I bought them based on industry, strategy, and PEG.  Check it out. 
 FYI - I created a folder for all Stagecoach files in ...GasStructuring\Stagecoach. 
 Kristin,  I plan to attend as a greeter if needed.  Is there a reception on the Wednesday night prior to first-round interviews?   Thanks,  Charlie 
 You may consider linking to this regular column from your gopusa site. 
 I'm always ready to crap but if you want assistance pre-crap, then let me know.. 
 One less competitor............ 
 I'll let you know where you can go.  Probably pretty much anywhere in Buddy's or I might can arrange for you to sit in another area.  It won't be a problem but we will need to communicate.  Right now my friend Weldon is hunting in my blinds as he has not gotten a deer in 6 years and has paid my Dad ~$5000 over the period.  Paul is still hunting in there too and that's where Travis killed his deer.    Check out the following link on the weather: http://www.weather.com/weather/cities/us_tx_dallas.html   Take the last three days with a grain of salt because those forecasts are automated and tend to spit out some garbage.  However, a true blue norther should be coming and don't be surprised if Dallas sees the teens next week with highs below freezing. 
 My cousin told me about chewing your ass out.  He was pretty embarassed as he is really a nice guy.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:  1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.  2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport. It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.  3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.  Let me know if you have any further questions.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 John,  Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous quotes, the new updated notionl bid is $4.51/MMBTU.  Let me know if you need any more assistnace.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Doug,  This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).  Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.   Charlie 
 We'll probably come down on the 21st.  If you are still there then maybe we can hook up and go out there together and laugh away the deer.  How does a January/February trip up to Grapevine sound?  Oh yeah, Melissa's pregnant.  Due first week in August.  It's early so we are being cautious but I figured you would want to know. 
 Congratualtions, Will!  May God bless you and your family.  She's a beautiful baby.  How is recruiting going?   Any idea where you think you will end up.  I'm sorry it did not work out at Enron.  I know that you will do well wherever you go.   Charlie 
 Up 8.5%!!!!, for now 
 Vince,  Mr. Horn's request has been taken care of.  He has the data he wanted and knows how to call it up on his Bloomberg terminal in the future.  Charlie 
 Indeed.  If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another Arctic blast to directly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach $10.  Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?  A frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next week. 
 I saw it.   After our conversation, I did add some Citi and Wachovia and have since lost but I still think it's a good move.  Hopefully there will not be any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past.  I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other.  I'm pretty balanced now between financials, tech, drugs, energy, and consumer (WMT).  ENE closing at $72+!!!!! 
 You ARE a professional 
 Any day next week except Monday or Thursday is good for me. 
 Not sure how I got your e-mail at v.charlie.weldon@enron.com but my username is v.charles.weldon@enron.com 
 I would recommend selling Intel today. It is up with the market this morning even after a bad announcement.  The fundamentals for anything PC related going forward are the worse they have been in 5 years or more.

 I want the same as I currently have.  All I need is a page refill for 2001.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 The best summary of what is going on here that I have read recently:  http://www.infoxpress.com/reviewtracker/reprints.asp?page_id=814 
 Jim,  Are you going to invite the others?  Charlie 
 I saw that too.  I agree on Ferguson but I think Toombs will have to show that he can play with all his heart  (and ass) every week.  He could be a Bettis type back if he stays committed. 
 In case you haev not heard, we are likely to have an ice storm here tomorow. 
 I would call this the Arctic Express.  I think Fergie will stay unless his grades knock him out.  In that case, I would say he is a third rounder or so, which ain't bad for 10 games in Div 1-a! 
 ENE - 77! 
 I agree.  Even the best of accounting maneuvers will not be able to hide the fact that (if) EBS is not fundamentally successful.  So the question is, is there a way to go long ENE and short EBS?  Probably not, but if there were a surrogate for EBS, the trade might work in most scenarios.  How about shorting a long-term broadband contract? 
 That's the irony 
 Shirley,  I am scheduled to take vacation on December 22, 27, 28, and 29.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Not sure? 
 I am writing to inform you that the deadline for your offer of employment from Enron has been extended until January 2, 2001.    More information will follow between now and then.   If you have any questions regarding this extension, please call me at 1-800-97ENRON (extension 57229) or Kristin Gandy at extension 53214.   Thank You,  Charlie Weldon 
 Per Shelly Jones, I sent this note to all UT MBA's that received offers for Associate positions. 
 Dr. Wilkens,  Thank you for your time and advice.  I would appreciate if you would be able to provide me with contact information for Dr. Jim Jones at the University of Florida as well as Dr. Joe Ritchie, per your offer to do so.   Thanks again,  Charlie Weldon 
 Bill,  I enjoyed talking with you about our potential software needs.  It sounds like you may have something to offer in which we are interested, and we are looking forward to a visit from you or one of your representatives in early January.   If you want to contact me, I can be reached at 713-345-7229 or by reply to this E-mail.   Thank You,  Charlie Weldon 
 Ouch! 
 Thank You! 
 Tomorrow's another day.  Looks like I bought ARBA at the top. 
 Todd,  Thanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get exact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more time on this.   It's definitely good that we have this data though should we need it.   Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Dave,  Just wondering if you have had a chance to consider these new risk management tools we are considering.   Thanks!  Charlie Weldon Enron Corp - Houston 
 Kristin,  The software has arrived.  I have not had a chance to check it out yet but will do so ASAP.  I've been gone for the last 4 working days.  Charlie

 I watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with Benson.   He definitely got good blocking but he showed power, speed, balance, vision.  I believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success.  His interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also.  I'll take over 800 yds next year if you take under. 
 He sounded reasonably intelligent but nothing to get too excited about.  I'll be shocked if he gets redshirted regardless of how good Hayter is.  BEnson is the 4th all-time rusher in texas history having just passed the great Robert Strait from Cuero (85-88) and almost passing Rodney Thomas.  Those guys don't get redshirted.  I'm befuddled about the O-line numbers.  Ya'll got this kid Winston this weekend over us even though we have only one OL commit and need 4 or so. Slocum  has got to close the deal on a few more of these top recruits or we are doomed.  2 of the top 3 linemen are still available and we've got a reasonable shot at them but Hightower (#1) still says he's going to visit and consider Texas.  Amazing... 
 Any comments?..... 
 I've got SLR and FLEX in this group and maybe that's a good thing....we'll see  http://www.zdii.com/industry_list.asp?mode=news&doc_id=ZE506926 
 Jonathan,  Hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend.  I'd like to catch up with you today if possible regarding recruiting etc.  Can I reach you by phone.  If so, where? You can call me toll free at 1-800-97-ENRON and follow the menu.   My extension is X57229 or you can use the voice activated system.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Gary,  Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.  Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my opinion.  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001219/bs/rayovac_outlook_dc_1.html   One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are financially "not doing so well" at present due in some part to a lack of hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.  Please let me know how I may be of assistance.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 This is an excerpt from an internal Weather Channel (Landmark Communications) newsletter.....   BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit, and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow the storms. In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent - with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13 percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops. A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday, delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over twice the average December monthly rating to date. Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also was within the top 10. 
 Keep trying.  We are definitely interested.  How much does a pair of tickets to an inaugural ball run? 
 In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 and buy the tickets for $125.   This does sound like a good one to go to based on the Website but sounds like we are out of luck there.  I imagine (hope) that the other balls are comparable.  I found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated. 
 If we can't get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit or two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are indeed pathetic salesmen. These guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh if not play as true freshmen, even though RC likes to redshirt all OL'men.  http://www.dallasnews.com/sports_day/colleges/football/243173_21amlede.html 
 We've got a 2-deep OL lineup for next year but I question the quality as only a few were legit blue-chips and I like the odds of getting bluechips versus sleepers.  I think we'll get one of the 2 studs and maybe both.  The main concern is that our primary weakness in the past few years has been a lack of dominate line play.  We've got the skill guys, DB's and LB's. 
 Slightly different subject,  check this link out.  Kiper seems to indicate that you must be a 3rd year soph or a junior to enter the draft.  Is this true? Does it mean rising junior or completed junior?  Implications for Roy W. and UT?  http://espn.go.com/melkiper/s/2000/1218/960110.html

 Had a great time this weekend.  I'm sure glad that Travis got another good buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty possible next year.  I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she "owed" her but nothing more than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this week as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.  Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she wasn't able to "prove" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard. She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good Christmas for everyone.  Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see my point of view here.   Thanks!  Charlie

 Not gonna happen.  Offer up 5 total all in sign on, plus they guaranteed the same y-e that we have. where before it was not detailed. 
 No, did you?  Hard to believe that its' still falling after today's news:  HOUSTON, Jan. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN - news) today announced that the company will significantly exceed previously forecasted fourth quarter recurring earnings of $0.22 to $0.25 per share. In addition, the company also reaffirmed that it is comfortable with the upper range of current estimates for 2001, which will represent an increase over 2000 of about 30 percent. 
 I will not be able to attend.  Thanks, Charlie 
 FYI - Attached is a quote from a recent TWC memo that should be of interest given our recent conversations....   Charlie   "December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to quieter than usual hurricane activity." 
 did you do it? 
 I will be there.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Remi,  Thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high quality job in your PRC representative role.  Per your request, I am attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last few months.  I am currently in my first rotation as an Associate which I  began this past summer following graduation from UT with an MBA in Energy Finance.   I am assigned to Vince Kaminski's Research Group on the Market Fundamentals Team. This team is commonly referred to as the "Weather Group" and is headed by my supervisor, Mike Roberts.  We are located on the gas trading floor (32nd) and provide direct support to all the gas desks as well as weather derivatives trading.  Thanks again for your interest and I am looking forward to meeting you. Please let me know if you need any additional information.   Sincerely,  Charlie Weldon 
 Why don't you buy deep in the money put options?  They will have a high delta and hence move almost dollar for dollar with the stock. 
 Check out NOK Feb 55 puts, NZYMK.X  They are up 4-5/8 while NOK is down 4-5/8.  2932 contracts out wth 24 traded today so liquidity shouild be OK.  Buy 400 ERICY for ~$4000 and one NOK put contract of NZYMK.x.  That should give you a delta on NOK equiv to shorting $4000 of the stock.  Did I figure this right? 
 sounds somewhat believable.  I can imagine the frenzy on the discussion boards if that got out.  I won't be the one to put it out there.  i think one more year and then its done.  Would the motivation for the Aggie AD to work really be only money? 
 Yep.  We won't  miss him as much as we will Fergie if he goes though.  I think if he's fully committed to being as good a pro as possible he could be really good.  We'll see. 
 WE'll likely move Joe Weber to FB.  He's ~225 lbs and pretty fast for a FB so he'll do.  Whitaker will still be TB but we've got a redshirt frosh named Keith Joseph who has the dimensions of Eddie George and played really well on the scout team.  I'll bet he sees a lot of PT at TB if he's really that good.  He was one of the very few guys that RC got over MacIII in the last few years of recruiting. 
 ENE up 1-3/4!  Option bid only up 3 teenies from where I bought it though. the spread on options is about a 1/4 which makes it tough. 
 Rebecca,  I was looking in EHROnline at my available vacation to verify that it all got accounted for correctly in 2000.  It appears that it did except for the fact that when I attempted to view my available vacation for 2001, it only indicates that I have 120 hours available.  I should have an additional 16 hours left due to the 10 hours that accrued on 12/31/00 and the 6 I had left over.  Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?  Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of $84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering aftershocks throughout the U.S. energy community.  As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and the uncertain profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years.  The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are facing the prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge their customers for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation.  The risks to Enron are two-fold.  For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the company does operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global revenue streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the region.  More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis abates. Some also fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended economic consequences.  Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination along the way. And a strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment.  The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E and Edison's ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap.  Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last week. The initial euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic economic growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized defensive plays like Enron.  We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly in natural gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months.  In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the future. The markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next year. An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send profits measurably higher in the long term.  Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. Although the stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the market approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going forward 
 I will be unable to attend.  Thank You,  Charlie Weldon 
 I don't disagree with your view, but I wouldn't count broadband out yet.  It may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.  By the way,  I doubled up on JPM today.  It's showed me a profit you know.....

 From the Street.com....  Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the new-power/alternative energy industries. Unlike broader energy funds, this pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

 A good time, indeed!  Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the near future.  I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" or otherwise contribute.  I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your knowledge of business, etc.  We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.  I'm looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around. I added my sisters to the GOPUSA distribution list and may add some others later tonight.  When is the website going to have our pictures?   Thanks,  Charlie
