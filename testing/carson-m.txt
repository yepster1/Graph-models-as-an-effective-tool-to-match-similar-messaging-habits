 do you have machart's phone # ??? 
 It is WentaPB@phoenix-cement.com  Did you have a good Christmas???  MC 
 I will try to get some... I am having troubles with my computer today.....  Have a Happy Holiday!  MC 
 Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing, which should be fun!  Have a happy holiday!  MC 
 What are your guys plans for the USC game this Wk end??   Cold Beers sound GOOOOOOOOOOOOD!  MC
