 I entered an annuity for april thru september.  We should bill them for October the first of next week and on the first of each month thereafter. 
 looks good 
 I see Montrell discovered he had only one kidney and was forced to quit.  Too bad he didn't get an NFL signing bonus first. I think they will miss him. North Carolina should be easy. Good Luck.  Be safe.  Universities are an easy place for Terrorists to hide. 
 My pick for week 3 is Buffalo  Platter 
 AWESOME 
 solid perspective on current situation. 
 No clue what you are talking about.  We'll be there. 2 adults 3kids 
 What voting buttons? 
 Please sign me up for the loser pool.  My pick for this week is Chicago.  The check is in the mail.  Thanks! Phil Platter 
  I got it fed exed yeaterday 
  Count me in. I'll give 10 and enron will match 
 If you can do all that , you can beat KSU.  I think NU can beat everyone but OU.  CU will be tough at Boulder no matter what.  Its like UT playing the aggies.  They get up for it.  Also ISU will give us a game.  If our D is attacking and we have a pass rush.  We could be in the Title Game to play OU again. 
 phillip.platter@enron.com  Hey Dave,  Of course I remember you! And you were right, Saturday the 25th was my birthday(37).  I feel especially old now that I am surrounded by 24year olds.  I wish some old people like you were still around.  How dou you like Phoenix? and SRP? And how is your family getting along?  I have 3 kids now.  The last one is 19 mos old. I am done. We have more and more people around here.  I am the last of the "Texans" . The rest all went back to Houston.  Brett Hunsucker went to ERCOT in Austin.  I think he likes it.  Miller and Forney and Smith Day are all working for Enron on the ERCOT desk. I can't trade this place for Houston. Drop me a line Dave. Its been good to hear from you! 
 yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute. How will the aggies be? 
 Mr. Ried,  I thought I'd drop you a line to inquire about
