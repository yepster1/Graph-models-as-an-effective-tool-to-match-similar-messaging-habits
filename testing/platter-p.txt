e 3 kids now.  The last one is 19 mos old. I am done. We have more and more people around here.  I am the last of the "Texans" . The rest all went back to Houston.  Brett Hunsucker went to ERCOT in Austin.  I think he likes it.  Miller and Forney and Smith Day are all working for Enron on the ERCOT desk. I can't trade this place for Houston. Drop me a line Dave. Its been good to hear from you! 
 yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute. How will the aggies be? 
 Mr. Ried,  I thought I'd drop you a line to inquire about the energy marketer position you have had open.  I understand you had the position open internally and that if you did not find a qualified candidate you would consider outside candidates.  I am currently awaiting an offer from UBS, the new owner of Enron's wholesale trading assets.  I want to reiterate my desire to return to Omaha and  to work for OPPD.  Please let me know of the status of your search for an energy marketer. I can be reached on my cell at 503-701-9736.  Thanks! 
  fyi for your neighbor 
 Where are the aggie headlines????  This is no big deal. A 20 year old gets drunk,some asshole cops treat them like shit and they mouth off to the asshole cops, who being the only ones able to excercise the power trip, get the last word.  Same thing happened to me in Lincoln and I was not a football player.  I had no sanctions and my charges were dropped.  He will miss the opener because he's a player.  When will espn give equal time to all of the other teams who have drunk 20 year olds getting into trouble.  How are you by the way?  I really miss having you around, especially this time of year.  OUT

 I'm very interested in going.  Keep me posted.  I'm sure Hannah will have a blast. 
 this checks out on the volume 
 what is this? 
 Bob,  I gladly pledge $50 and will have my company match it.  I  admire your willingness to do this. 
 Steve & Christian,  After talking with the Southwest desk here is what is happening with Azusa.  Deal #831407.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Purchase from Azusa at $32.50  1/1/02 thru 3/31/02 Deal #537901.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Sale to Azusa at $139.00         1/1/02 thru 12/31/02  These two deals are the only ones active for January  and are being performed on.  They are booked out financially. All other deals I found are for Q3 '02 and beyond.  I hope this clarifies some things.  PP 
 fyi 
 wow. this is bad news.  If he had pounded his girlfriend instead, I would feel better about our chances of winning a national championship. 
 Dennis,  I'm attempting to understand how the UC-Davis deal, if done, will impact us .  How is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service? One concern that I had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice(real time) this would cause some big problems for our real time group. To my knowledge, we don't currently have any contracts like this.  Is this the reason UC-Davis wasn't included in the original deal with the UC System?  Can you give me a call or an e-mail?  The number below is correct. Thanks!

 FOR JULY EPMI SELLS EES 26 OFFPEAK AND 12 ONPEAK IN NP15 EPMI SELLS EES 168 OFFPEAK AND 172 ONPEAK IN SP15 THESE ARE NET POSITIONS. YOU ARE SHORT . 
 Dave,  Went OK.  I gave Susan a few issues that need to be worked on.  1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP. 2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.  Some progress was made on Generation.  If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP. The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.  We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc.  The 10day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned.  Susan was running template comparisons for the 1st thru the 3rd. which may need some work on our part. 
  o and if you critisize my futba program again I'll pull your hair and scratch you belly and throw a basketball at you. 
 Serena,  Please use the new sheet to schedule california.  It is called ca0117estate. It is in the 2002 directory.  This will be the only sheet we use.  We will no longer have a separate EES Sheet.  The load will be pulled into this new sheet.  See me for details and questions. 
 Lincoln Police obviosly have a automatic link to the press.  Or the press is pinging the rap sheets daily.  This is not news.  Don't tell me no aggies ever have fights with their girlfriends or punch out a guy over a girl.  Its only news because of Local papers and police want it to be.  Call the College Station Police and ask if any football players have been involved in any "assaults".  They'd probably tell you its not your business.  This brown thing is funny because the new boyfriend kicked his ass. 
 Diana, Please provide me with Enterprise Manager so  can utilize SQL queries.  Thank You! 
 I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THAT THE HUSKER BBALL TEAM MADE THE BIG TWELVE PROUD.  I'LL TAKE  A DISTURBING THE PEACE CHARGE ANY DAY , JUST NO SLAPPING YO GIRLFRIEND KIND A CRAP. HOW ARE THINGS ? 
 Somehow the commucication on these deals got fubared.  I've gone with the assumption that we bought 3mw NP15 and !2 sp15 at 295 and $280 respectively for June. Did this happen?  If the idea was to flatten EES out , we should have sold to them.  Any insight would be appreciated.

 I entered all the Mega deals in CAPS. We have them for at least another Month.  I also updated the excel sheet for Mega and created a JUNE folder. June 1 file is also set up in that folder.  I have not pulled the June data into that file.  I have not checked out with anyone for June.  They will be ready to ' check out on Tuesday.  Make a point to call CRC and get any sc trades they have.  Callaway is a new deal we have .  The info I have is that it will be a sale for 9MW flat every day for 5years.  This is an EES deal. and will need to be entered on the EES sheet and entered on CAPS.  I think APX1 will be the SC.  Foster and Richter know about this deal. Just make sure it is accounted for as an EES deal, it will not appear in Enpower.  There is a wind deal that Elliot did with Edwards Air Force Base.  I don't have enough info on this yet. It starts June 1. 
 Elliot,  I need more info.   What zone? Is it strictly an SC trade?  What is the shape? Will it change daily? Who is the SC? What is the proposed schedule? Who is the counterparty in Enpower?  I would like the info Tuesday morning if possible.  I will be out  for the week starting Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. If this is not possible, Jeremy will need the info sometime later on Tuesday. Let's talk Tuesday morning. Thx!
