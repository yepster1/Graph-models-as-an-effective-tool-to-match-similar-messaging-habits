iends or punch out a guy over a girl.  Its only news because of Local papers and police want it to be.  Call the College Station Police and ask if any football players have been involved in any "assaults".  They'd probably tell you its not your business.  This brown thing is funny because the new boyfriend kicked his ass.

 I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THAT THE HUSKER BBALL TEAM MADE THE BIG TWELVE PROUD.  I'LL TAKE  A DISTURBING THE PEACE CHARGE ANY DAY , JUST NO SLAPPING YO GIRLFRIEND KIND A CRAP. HOW ARE THINGS ? 
 Somehow the commucication on these deals got fubared.  I've gone with the assumption that we bought 3mw NP15 and !2 sp15 at 295 and $280 respectively for June. Did this happen?  If the idea was to flatten EES out , we should have sold to them.  Any insight would be appreciated.

 I entered all the Mega deals in CAPS. We have them for at least another Month.  I also updated the excel sheet for Mega and created a JUNE folder. June 1 file is also set up in that folder.  I have not pulled the June data into that file.  I have not checked out with anyone for June.  They will be ready to ' check out on Tuesday.  Make a point to call CRC and get any sc trades they have.  Callaway is a new deal we have .  The info I have is that it will be a sale for 9MW flat every day for 5years.  This is an EES deal. and will need to be entered on the EES sheet and entered on CAPS.  I think APX1 will be the SC.  Foster and Richter know about this deal. Just make sure it is accounted for as an EES deal, it will not appear in Enpower.  There is a wind deal that Elliot did with Edwards Air Force Base.  I don't have enough info on this yet. It starts June 1. 
 Elliot,  I need more info.   What zone? Is it strictly an SC trade?  What is the shape? Will it change daily? Who is the SC? What is the proposed schedule? Who is the counterparty in Enpower?  I would like the info Tuesday morning if possible.  I will be out  for the week starting Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. If this is not possible, Jeremy will need the info sometime later on Tuesday. Let's talk Tuesday morning. Thx!
