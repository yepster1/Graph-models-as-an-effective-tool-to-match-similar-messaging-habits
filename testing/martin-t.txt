t that day is the day that you and the girls are joining Mom for the Christmas function at Jones Hall.  Let's talk tonight.  Tom 
 I talked to Brian and he and I agreed to the concept but we want it to more simple (ie. less expensive).  We are thinking about just getting together and have some beers at Cabo's while signing Christmas cards.  No catering, just a few drinks and maybe some appetizers off the menu.  The traders probably don't have many if any customers that are not already covered by Brian's group but check with Eric, Joe, Charlie, Daren and Dave.  Tom 
 Thanks for the info.  Call me today when you get some time I need you to look something up on the computer.  Tom 
 Ok, I will try to take a look at it this afternoon or tonight.  Tom 
 I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.  So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.  Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.  Thanks,  Tom 
 I am sorry I forgot to update you.  Right now I am planning to be out the 12th, 13th, 14th and 17th.  The 17th is for sure the rest is tenative.  My plan is to take 3 to 5 days sometime the first two weeks of December.  Tom 
 I was not aware that the market closed at 1:00 on Friday 11/23.  Funny we did not discuss this when we talked on the phone on Wednesday.  How does this impact the bigger issue that needs to be resolved?  Let me know when you get the answer on the rest of the matter.  Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.  Tom 
 You are mistaken.  I have never logged into "iPayit" before, so it impossible that I have an unpaid invoice.  Tom 
 Kelley,  Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transa= ctions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully o= ur situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in= the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual= things happening in the "Fixed Float" markets in Texas particularily at HS= C.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went fr= om plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry H= ub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.3= 1 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we ha= ve no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some = trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more fina= ncially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed pri= ce physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant= in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted f= or index consideration.  Thank you,  Tom Martin 
 Brent,  Per our phone conversation Enron agrees to buy back 21,417/d at Carthage for December at IFGMR HSC index - .08.  I have also talked to EPrime who is our supplier and they are buying back this 21,417/d from Enron at IFGMR HSC - .08.  They will subsequently sell the gas to Woodward directly at IFGMR HSC - .08.  Both EPrime and Woodward agree that HSC - .08 is a fair market value for Carthage volumes during bidweek for December.  The purpose of this transaction is to mitigate the risk of physical non-performance by Enron given our current financial condition without impacting the contractual pricing of the deals previously done with Eprime and Woodward respectively.  Regards,  Tom Martin 
 We addressed this yesterday.  I have never signed to iPayit before so it is impossible for me to have an unpaid invoice.  Tom 
 Irma,  I know you guys are vey busy right now on other matters but I am sure that you can appreciate my nerveousness about what you guys are going to me for me.  I still expect Enron to do the right thing a correct the error that was made prior to closing the Savings Plan for the change in administrator.  Please update me on your progress.  Thank you,  Tom 
 You guys keep sending me this message and I keep telling you that I have never used this system.  Please call me and tell what you issue is at ext. 33079 because I have never logged into this system before.  Tom 
 Attached please find my Enron work history.  Can you make it look similar to the others that are being done and combine it with the resume from HR.  Thanks,  Tom 
 No thank you.  tom 
 Save 3 spots for the Texas desk if possible.  Thanks.  Tom 
 Laura,  I can be reached at Home, Pager and Cell Phone in that order.  Also whatever happened to the pager invoice issue, did it get paid or do I need to convert to personal account to keep it?  Tom 
 Laura,  Did you get the time for my interview of the meteorologist tomorrow?  Also I plan to attend the Gas Fundamentals presentation tomorrow afternoon from 2-4 if you can send me a reminder.  Tom 
  Good article on the state of corporate America that caused an 'Enron-like" situation http://www.quicken.com/investments/news/tst/notemplates/frame.dcg?symbol=ENE&ntlink=http://www.thestreet.com/_intuit/funds/meetthestreet/10007532.html 
 I am not familiar with this system but it seems philosophically we should protest even though we don't currently do any business on this pipeline. What do you guys think?  Tom 
 Lyne,  Based on my review it looks like our benefit costs for comparable coverages to what we had with Enron is about $50 higher per month with UBS.  See attachment.  Tom

 That is a sensitive question as I have asked you before about us giving up Reuters and getting one Bloomberg monitor.  We have heard nothing since that lady came by took Reuters away and said she would get us Bloomberg. 
 Since Bryan Hull works as an analyst at my desk I would like to discuss the "no" feedback with him.  Please let me know when it is appropriate to do so.  Tom

 Probably Thursday noon since some people are planning to be out Friday.  Tom 
 Do I need to do something more with Eric?  I talked to him the other day, trying to reassure him that Lavo realizes the value that he brings to the organization and that he will be taken care of.  Tom 
 Bass and Parks. 
 Could you send me an updated list of the traders remaining vacation days for 2001.  I am hearing a lot of members of the desk wanting to get their vacation by the end of the year.  I want to know what I am dealing with.  Try to include Daren and Dave as well.  Thanks,  Tom 
 It said "may" contain a virus.  Sorry!!!!  I looked at it and it looks fine.  Tom 
 thank you.  Looks like another year where everybody is going to try to get vacation in at the last minute. 
 I am having Daren, Bryan, Dave and Charlie coordinate their vacation days for the rest of the year.  I am having Eric and Joe do the same.  Clearly the calendar does not reflect what these guys will probably want to do by the end of the year.  Tom 
  Please send to the rest of the Texas Desk.  Tom 
 Lyne,  I have 108 hours of vacation left and wanted your input as to how to use some of it.  I will carry over 40 hours to next year.  We are off Christmas Eve.  I was thinking of taking 11/19 off since I have that doctor appointment.  Otherwise maybe 3 to 5 days the first two weeks of December will work.  I may be able to take a half day or two at other times if there is something special you want me to do.  Tom 
 Upon closer examination, more people looking dirty.  Tom 
  John,  A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move q
