00 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.  Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.  Any Thoughts?  Love,  Tom 
 If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required Enron to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep Enron whole.  Any thoughts?  Tom 
 Fine.  Tom 
 Attached are the rates for April.  I know the King Ranch and Agua Dulce rates to HSC are a mute point with the work on the A/S Line.  Needless to say we will be a seller either during Bidweek and/or on a daily basis on A/S South.  Thanks,  Tom 
 I think Gary Bryan already sent you a list that had this info.  Let me know if you did not get it.  Tom 
 Jim and I will be on vacation from March 12th thru March 16th.  Jim took a lap top computer with him and is reachable by cell phone.  Kim has our pager and cell phone numbers.  I will be calling in to see how Eric is doing and to see if any of my folks have any questions about their employment contracts.  I asked Philip to keep an eye on Eric as well.  Eric sat in the morning meeting today and will fill for me next week.  Thanks,  Tom 
 You guys have the list right?  Can you send it to Mike?  Tom 
 I received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:  1 Lead Physical Trader 1 Physical Trader 1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)  1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator 1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator  I met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer. I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.  I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.  Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.  The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.  Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.  I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.  Thanks,  Tom 
  Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any further questions let me know.  Thanks,  Tom 
  Thanks for the invite but I have a family commitment on that day.  Tom 
 My basis trader is out Friday, so I need to cover his EOL stack until 3:30.  I can get together with you after 3:30.  Monday I am booked. Any way that we can get together after 3:30 Friday?  Tom 
 Tuesday begins Bidweek.  I try to restrict time away from the desk to after 2:15.  Is that possible?  Tom 
 Works for me.  Tom 
 Sherrie,  I talked to Karen Buckley and she said that the HR analyst and associate program is currently full but may be looking to hire again in the summer.  She told me that there may HR needs and/or recruiting needs in specific divisions that she is not aware of.  Her recommendation is to look on the Enron Job Seeker website to see if there are any specific jobs that may be of interest to you.  Call me if you after you look at the website and let me know if there are any opportunities that make sense for you.  Tom 
   Sorry we have not talked again recently.  I have been trying to get a better handle on other personnel movement on the gas floor that has an impact on my needs.  I would like to talk further with you.  Maybe we can get together next week after work for a beer and talk about what your interests are and I can tell you more about my needs.  I am open Tuesday - Thursday.  Let me know if you can get away.  If not let's try to set up some time to talk in the afternoon.  Thanks,  Tom 
 Lauri,  Here are the rates for May.  Again the A/D long haul rates are irrelevant for most of the month.  Call me if you have any questions.   Thanks,  Tom 
 Since I anticipate that we will be trying to inject and Katy is the only location that helps, I am trying to give us a little extra incentive to get gas in the ground.  I don't anticipate buying much Clear Lake gas other than the short that we have there (6,500/d I think).  Tom 
 Mtg w/Dave Baumbach, Pushkar Shahi, Jim Coffey, and Gary Hickerson Laura set up meeting - EB32c2 w/permission from Rain 01/30/01
