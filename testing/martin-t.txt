objec= tive in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have= a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I coul= d utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his = current job.  The bottom line is that Dave is very good at his current role= and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opport= unity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity t= o see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move D= ave into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into = trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under t= he impression that Dave cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appe= ars that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and= certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this= ?  Tom 
 Brian,  Don't worry about comprimising our trading position because I think AEP via the HPL employees already have a general idea of what we have been doing with storage; plus they will need to know as of close anyway.  Tom 
 Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Tom  x 33079 
  It is my understanding that five AEP employees will in Enron's offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect Enron's proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.  Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:  1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.  2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.  Examples  Case 1 Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma) Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and Katy) Total Index Position           300,000/d long  Vols. targeted for storage   200,000/d  Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  Enron sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.  Case 2 Core term index positi
