the month problem.  Stacey 
 Bob,  What is the plan for this going forward?  I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this, I am correct?  Stacey 
 I certainly do not anticipate that we will.  I hope the Estate people are designating someone for this.  I am going to look into it.  Stacey 
 Thank you. 
 I think your resume looks good.  Brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes.  He says send a resume, call or both.  Stacey 
 Power December books are final.  This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec. 31 calculation.  We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books.  Also, power books are set up as you have defined below.  Stacey 
 Will be there. 
 Thanks for the reminder.  Just an FYI - it is not babysitting when it is your own kids.  (Just kidding - wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's.)  Stacey 
 I updated the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet with the following update.  FYI - it is NSTAR!  Stacey 
 Here's what he said.... 
 Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss, who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a management position, her resume should speak for itself.  Let me know.  Stacey 
 Please update me on the answer to the following e-mail.  I am almost certain I know the answer, but would like to make sure we are all on the same page.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Roberto,  Can you please add to the m: drive a first tier directory of common.  Please let me know ASAP that this is complete.  Thanks, Stacey White Director, Power Risk Management 713-853-1870 
 Do you know if they got these same numbers from John?  Stacey 
 Make sure you talk to Casey & John.  Most of my Houston group has been out of the office either this morning or this afternoon for a UBS orientation.  Stacey 
 I will be out of the office for a UBS orientation.  Stacey 
 Do you think we should get Sonia to update this?  Stacey 
 Can you go to this meeting in the morning?  I have two others at this same time.  We can go over what they will be looking for before the meeting.  Stacey 
 kimsach@hotmail  Here you go.  There is a chance I may have to go to a UBS dinner tonight, but it might get changed to tomorrow.  If it does get changed, I will be there tonight.  Stacey 
 Thanks for the update.  I finally talked to him also.  The message you just told me, is what I communicated to Samantha.  Whenever or if ever, you find out more specifics re: Portland estate, please let me know.  Stacey 
 Sounds good to me.  The only days I don't want to meet are the 4th and 5th.  Stacey 
 According to Tim, if we could find no other spots for her to stay in Risk, she would be designated as VM and Kit Blair would be taken off the list.  Do you know what communication is being given to 'estate' employees in Portland?  Stacey 
 I have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person.  I have all of Heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her, if it has not already been communicated.  Also, please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland.  I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha.  If you want to talk to me you can reach me at 281-894-0468 or send me an e-mail.  Stacey 
 Who do we ask to set up the m:\common?  This makes the most sense to me.  Stacey 
 Thank you so much for this query.  At this time, I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet.  The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank.  However, the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value.  I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error.  There are too many variables that are unknown.  The good thing is, it works now.  Thanks, Stacey 
 So sorry to be such a bother, but I just want to make sure that you received and are frantically thinking about my message.  UBS is needing names confirmed this morning so offer letters can go out today.  Stacey 
 Home 281-412-9234 Cell 713-553-3641  Hope these are still the same.  Stacey 
 Thanks 
 The following post-id's represent the re-calcs for 11-30: 15785 - total P&L $48,108,223 15786 - total P&L $(128,887,942) 15788 - total P&L $1,168,735,362 15789 - total P&L $(101,541,449)  The total forward P&L for these post-id's should be $986,414,195  The following spreadsheets represents the final product from our request.  Please see if you can pull by the parameters we chose from AdHoc.    Stacey 
 Can Cecilia do what she has requested below?  Stacey 
 It looks good for me.  There are a couple of applications I do not have access to.  Let me know what method you would like me to take in requesting access.  Stacey 
 You will LOVE this!  Stacey 
 Have you told Kathy about this transfer?  Should it be a bankruptcy book?  Stacey 
 have you forwarded to John, or do I need to? 
 Are they working on it? 
 Yes, thank you.  How much do I owe you?  Stacey 
 I totally agree!!  Stacey 
 Did y'all export, etc.?  Stacey 
 Can you update the original file you sent with Bryce's changes below.  I am afraid I do not understand exactly what I should change on Sequent.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Hope all is well.  My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com  The one you have will be decommissioned shortly.  I still have a job and will more than likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business.  Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with you?  Stacey  If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.  713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang. 
 Can you all verify that you do or do not use the applications listed below as soon as possible.  We are in the process of moving or discarding applications to move to the NETCO environment and are unaware of who uses the following applications.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thought you were moving this meeting to 3:00.  Jeff and I have a meeting with UBS from 1:00-2:30.  Stacey
