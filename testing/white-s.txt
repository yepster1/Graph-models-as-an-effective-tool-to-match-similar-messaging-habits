es.  That way, if anyone is comparing our lists later on their will be no discrepancy and they won't have to ask us again.  Thanks for all the other information.  Stacey 
 Fine by me. 
 As of now I should have no employees on the Estate list.  Israel Estrada was on the list previously, but we have moved him to Power Global Rates in Netco.  Stacey 
 Can one of you resend me the unarchive shortcut to 2000 data?  Stacey 
 Here is the latest Master.  It is kind of a cluster.  The easiest way to pi= ck out power is to set an AutoFilter and look at Enron Entity column.  Stacey 
   Let me know how I can help.  Stacey 
 Christina,  Just wanted to let you know that Donnie will be joining us for the 11:30 meeting.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Please review and let me know if I have misrepresented any counterparties.  If you want me to add comments, send them to me and I will incorporate.

This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thank you

 Melissa,  Here are some more to investigate!  Stacey 
 Melissa,  Can you find out if this Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement covers all our deals with TXU?  Stacey 
 Min,  I am so happy that you were moved to the Netco list.  Thank you for all your hard work and the efforts you have put forth to learn our needs and react quickly to them. I look forward to working with you in the future.  Stacey 
 Melissa,  Here are some more.  Just keeping you in the loop.  Stacey

 We have many deals in the system with UI, but they are all part of one contract.  To my knowledge, this is the only big contract we have with them.  Just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal.  Stacey

 I have another meeting at this time.  Can we reschedule or can I send someone else?  Stacey 
 Just wanted you to be aware of our concerns regarding Min Zheng.  He is our Excel support and is called upon on a daily basis for help.  Thanks, Stacey
