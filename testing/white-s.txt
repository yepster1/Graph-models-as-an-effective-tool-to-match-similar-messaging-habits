o YTD.  (Cell M245).  You can delete these information if you want.  Remove December from the reconciliation because I only gave them data through 11/30 and Curve Shift data for December is completely useless.  Stacey 
 Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.  Stacey 
 Due to problems with the gas curves there will be incorrect credit information for TXU, Calpine and Indeck Pepperel Power Assoc. out of EnPower (these counterparties have spread options and/or heat rate swaps that utilize the gas curves.)  If you need these transaction re-calced in the morning please contact Andrea Dahlke and X 5-4080.  Thanks,  Stacey 
 The gas curve problems have been solved; therefore, there will be no problems with the following counterparties.  Stacey 
 Do your gas books have any gas deals left?  There were 23,000 deals missed in the 'kill exercise' performed by IT.  If you have deals left, please re-calc tomorrow to see if they go away.  If you have no deals, then you are done!  Stacey 
 John,  This file gives you similar information to the file that Jeff sent you for gas.  Frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model.  If you want me to change anything, let me know.    Thanks, Stacey 
 We technically should have no third party transactions.  If we do, we need to move them to the NG-Price book.  Please let me know if this is the case.  Also, Casey & I will be both be out of the office tomorrow.  If you need someone in Houston to help get questions answered please call Andrea.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Here is the file I started.  I know there is plenty of missing data because I did not know all the commodities involved with each counterparty.  If you could fill in what you know, that would be a big head start on this heinous project.  I will be out of the office tomorrow.  My cell phone works again so I will be available.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Just want to make sure that Tom and Sam will be preparing these documents.  Stacey 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow and out of town this weekend.  If an emergency arises, please try the following numbers:  Home - 281-894-0468 Cell - 281-382-5215 Weekend - 361-275-6444  Have a great weekend! 
 To be totally consistent from the beginning, can you rename either your long term Long Names to not include spaces between 'North' and 'West' and 'South' and 'West'.  The short term books do not have spaces.  Stacey 
 FYI - Tim Carter resigned effective today.  Stacey 
 You can go ahead and send it to me as I am sure I will be performing the review at some point.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I was working on getting the right sign-off before I approved or denied.  I should know no later than tomorrow.  Stacey 
 Yeah - are you still going on vacation?  Stacey 
 Please try contacting him at the following numbers 713-668-7572 (home) 832-338-6793 (cell)  If you cannot contact him at these numbers, let me know, I have one other way of getting in touch with him.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I thought we already told them to exclude those portfolios???  Stacey 
 Geoff,  Here is all my data:  Home - 281-894-0468 Cell - 281-382-5215 Worst Case - my husband's pager - 281-264-9294  If you need anything else, please let me know.  Stacey 
 All your suggestions sound good.  Thanks for being on top of the personnel = issues!  Thanks again, Stacey 
 Who was your surgeon for lasik surgery?  Would you recommend?  I am planning on getting surgery next year and have to make my benefit elections to cover.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I was not sure if you wanted exposure by asset, liability or absolute value so I provided the top 25 assets and top 25 liabilities.  Hope this helps.  Stacey 
 Can you make sure that your group starts using the new & improved request form.  See m:\common\power\riskmgmt\admin\Requests & Request Templates\Blank Book Request Enpower.xls  Thanks, Stacey 
 Just a reminder to forward Martha the cash flow request.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Any calc will do.  When testing, please do not write over AdHoc, I need to pull some information from there.  Stacey 
 I hope all is well with you!  Kristin, Mike and I will be arriving in London Saturday, November 3.  We will be there through the next Saturday, leaving early that morning.  Can't wait to see you.  Any exciting news?  How's work, social life, etc.  Stacey 
 FYI 
 Please move until later in the afternoon.  I have a 9:00 and an 11:00 in the new building.  Stacey 
 Sorry I haven't responded very timely.  Things have been hectic at work.  I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Russell said you would be in around 6-7, is this right?  What kind of food do you want to eat, Russell suggested a Mexican food place, is this o.k. with you?  Stacey 
 Keith,  Here are the procedures for the East.  The West is not currently running option sensitivities.  Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  (Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thanks 
 Michael,  Can you remind me who all gets these reports?  Stacey 
 Yes.  Stacey 
 I was incorrect about Alberta ENA, it should be zero but where is Alberta?  It should have a big position.  Stacey 
 How many times are you going to publish the P&L today? (just a joke - is everything o.k.?)  Stacey 
 Tim,  I typically do not like to give access to m:\common\power\ directory as this is where all the DPR information is.  A member of your fundamentals team, Maria Van Houton, would like access to the drive in order to access curve data that the risk group puts together.  If this is o.k. with you I will approve, otherwise I will tell her to get the information from the curve directory m:\power2\region.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Do we have any transactions with these counterparties similar to Hanson?  Stacey 
 FYI - the only other temporary information I can give you is Thursday Feb 7. is simulation date (as per previous e-mail) and Monday, Feb. 11 is the current 'go live' date.  I'll try to keep you up to date with any changes.  If there is ANYTHING we think we have not done or will not complete by next Wednesday, Feb. 5 such as desk set ups, RisktRAC set up (including hierarchies), individual roll set ups, testing of Min's new DPR Automation, and anything else I may not be thinking of, please let me know as soon as possible, so we can get the right resources working on it.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I cannot view this request in eRequest.  Please approve on my behalf or remedy the problem of seeing the request and I will approve myself.  Stacey 
 The power curves are actually located in M:\power2\region  If you want access to this drive please resubmit request and make sure it is Read Only.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Please release the new version of PL Desk to production.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Sorry I left you off the first distribution.  Stacey 
 We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?  Thanks, Stacey 
 James,  Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.  Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.  Stacey 
 Maria,  What information are you trying to obtain through m:\common\power?  Sorry for all the questions, but everyone requesting this directory gets them as this directory contains extremely sensitive information.  Thanks, Stacey 
 No formal agenda has been planned for our staff meeting today.  Instead, I would like for each of you to think of a question(s) or problem(s) that you have encountered while in the group.  These questions/problems can be something that you already know the answer to or have yet to receive the answer.  For those areas that you already know the answer, this would be a good time to share what you have been working on with the rest of the group and maybe stop everyone else from running into the same question/problem.  For those areas that you do not the answer, we will do our best to get that answered.  In addition, if there is any additional detail that you would like to know regarding topics covered in the Risk Overview class, this would be a good time to ask since the class is fresh on your minds.  Thanks, Stacey & Casey 
 Jason,  I am aware of the risk being taken regarding the old Sun machines moving to the new building.  Specifically, they may not work once taken out of commission.  I am also willing to take this risk and request that the current machines the power risk group operates on should accompany them to the new building.  Thanks, Stacey 
 o.k. 
 Here is an updated New Power Company exposure as of 10-24.  I have included Buy/Sell, Deal Type, and Capacity/Commodity.  Please let me know if there is any other detail you need.  Stacey 
 I really am in the dark re: Hanson.  If you could make the rounds then we might have a better idea if Donnie should be there.  If Scotty does not know all the particulars (and Jeff does) I am not sure that the 9:30 PST meeting will be effective.  I basically just want some answers!  Stacey 
 I will not be there until 4:00.  Stacey 
 This is the meeting I was referring to.  Stacey 
 When: Thursday, October 25, 2001 10:30 AM-11:30 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: call-in 853-1870  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  I am also sending you a forward of a meeting I am supposed to have with Scotty Gilbert and Jeff Richter tomorrow - hope you can join us.  Stacey 
 Congratulations US Citizen!  You have to set up a new book (see the other Spreadsheet books for naming convention).  Can't wait to discuss all this.  Stacey 
 Can you take care of this?  Stacey 
 Sorry, I thought I did this yesterday.  m:\common\power\position\dpr\ena-cal\rho_drift.xls  Can you give me the latest on the reconciliation?  Stacey 
 He was not offered a job in UBS.  He was told last Friday, by me, that he would remain in the Estate, so his resignation is from the Estate.  Stacey 
 Can you get with Doug and show him what documentation we do have for Green Mountain?  Also, have you requested from Anita Luong the documentation we sent them for Green Mountain's Schedule C.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Just wondered if anyone has noticed any change in EnPower performance?  See e-mail below.  Stacey 
 There is no attachment.  Stacey 
 No, I just noticed that we hadn't had a staff meeting in a while and next week is month end and the next week I will not be here.  Casey is out on Friday and have back to back meetings tomorrow.  Make your commitment to DHA and we'll update you on the staff meeting.  Stacey 
 Martin,  I have both a toll tag and a parking transponder.  My toll tag # is 00136756.  Please let me know what else I need to do.  Thanks, Stacey White 
 How much money are we talking?  Re: AA, they will need explanation as to the amount.  Georgeanne is typically involved in all Schedule C discussion with them.  Stacey 
 Sorry I had to cancel, a meeting was put on my calendar that I cannot miss.  Stacey 
 When: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 12:00 PM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: EB3143C  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  We will begin having weekly download/discussion sessions starting the week after next.  This meeting will be mandatory and you should not send a substitute unless approved by me.  If the day and time do not work with your schedule please let me know so we can coordinate our calendars.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Can one of you make sure LT-SERC is still an active book (if not, have it reactivated) and coordinate with TJae regarding the EOL ID.  John may still be set up in EnPower, I am not sure that his access was ever taken away, but we need to have his trader ID attached to LT-SERC.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Stacey 
 We'll take care of it.  Welcome back!  Stacey 
 FYI  - we will be running a live simulation on Thursday.  I will give you more details when I know something.  John, When you get a chance will you ask Tim if he is aware of this?  Stacey 
 Yes - I travel to Portland on a regular basis and access the network from the hotel.  I also I am a member of the 'Emergency Weather Plan' team meaning that I have to simulate my computer at work from home in case my group (Power Risk Management) cannot get to the building.  Stacey White 
 I am sorry to be difficult and you can definitely have a meeting without me and fill me in later, but the all-employee meeting is today and I have been asked to be there by Bob.  In addition, I have a work lunch headed by Sally to discuss the all-employee meeting.  Sorry again,  Stacey 
 good luck 
 Thanks! 
 Can you or someone else ask her why she requested m:\common\power Read/Write?  Stacey 
 Why would this person need Read/Write to m:\common\power  I typically only grant access for Write capabilities to Risk.  Stacey 
 I have a meeting tomorrow from 10:30-11:30.  I do not have anything else until 2:00.  Stacey 
 What day? 
 The risk group should be able to help you coordinate this request.  Stacey White 
 I just heard a rumor that the Ercot Power Trading was going to sit in the Gas (Open) section.  Is this the case and does it change the seating for gas and power risk?  Thanks, Stacey 
 Tom,  Hope this helps.  1)  Only the power positions need to be queried.  Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench.  2)  Any power Exchange transactions should be included, but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench.   Thanks, Stacey 
 Cost Center 103823 should have 6% allocated to West Power (not 13%) and 94% allocated to East Power.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Are you setting up a meeting?  Stacey 
 Casey,  Can you remind me of all this?  Thanks, Stacey  John,  Good questions, when I figure it out I will add to the Month End Procedures.  Stacey 
 Tanya,  Kim mentioned to me that legal wanted by delivery point and financial/physical broken out, so here is an update.  Numbers are still as of 10/18/2001.  Stacey 
 Actually, I believe we got a hold of Kori and Erol last month before they officialized and they did it correctly.  Stacey 
 That is fine.  She doesn't really care about the Schedule C stuff, she just wants to know that is going to come off of LTD.  Stacey 
 As long as Tim has conversations with Lavo and we get adequate documentation to share with accounting, we should be fine.  Stacey 
 I don't know where all those pictures are.  We received them online, so I am sure they are lost.  Donnie may have them.  Remember, he was dressed as Austin Powers.  Stacey 
 Can you send me an example?  Stacey 
 Your gas books still have Bob Badeer and Matt Motley attached to them.  You need to send in a change for these books.  Stacey 
 Who do you have working on this?  Stacey 
 This is exposure (P&L and position) by month, by region for New Power Company.  Please let me know how often you need data like this.  The numbers represented are as of 10/18/2001.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thank you! 
 Can you send me (or tell me where to access) the matrix put together which defines the legal entity for each desk.  Debbie Brackett informed me that the entities are not necessarily the 'legal' entity but something else and I need to help get to the bottom of this.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thank you so much for the invite.  Just found this week I have to go to London for work and will be leaving on Nov. 2.  Have a wonderful time!!  Stacey 
 Zhiyun,  Let's go ahead and make this change.  We can think of no reason why this would cause a problem.  If everyone could keep a close eye on this deal after the change, that will be most beneficial.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Ramesh,  Do you still have a list of users who calculated their books at the end of September as 9/28 instead of 9/30?  Stacey 
 I cannot think of anything that would cause this to be incorrect.  Please let me know if you agree and I will bless the change.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Which ancillary curves are you referring to?  Dana and Doug mark the Northeast and Ercot ancillaries and we do not have ancillaries for every curve.  Stacey 
 yes 
 John,  Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Casey should be contacting you to set up a time to talk.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Nick,  I would like 3 red poinsettias.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Shifali,  I was given your name by Kathy Reeves as a candidate who might know something about a book named C2-CAND-EGSC.  See attached file below for instructions on what information is needed for the book.  Thanks, Stacey White 
 Who is your contact in Liquids?  Stacey 
 SLACKER!!! 
 I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Can everyone please check the following files for the below requirements.  Fill out anything you may know and cc: me on the response so I can figure out which ones are unaccounted for.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Just wanted you to see this correspondence.  Stacey 
 When: Friday, October 19, 2001 10:00 AM-11:00 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: EB3143B  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Please invite anyone I may have missed.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I am attaching this again because I am not certain that I saved it before I attached it the first time.  Stacey 
 There were some conversations regarding getting the Index Option into RisktRAC.  It may be that they are not there yet.  Zhiyun was working with the RAC IT, she would know the latest.  Stacey 
  Does this make sense to you?  Stacey 
 Make sure you have my e-mail address as the full name Stacey.W.White@enron.= com   I don't know why they would be coming back.  Hope you are doing well!  Stacey

(Revision: 4) 
 Are you still attending these meetings?  Stacey 
 Let me know if this does not work.  This is a report straight from the calculation engine so it is easy and fast to generate.  Stacey 
 Let's wait until we all meet so we don't piecemeal the data to you, but you are correct in your assumption about transmission for the East.  Stacey 
 Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in Houston.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.  I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.  If you don't mind, ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing.  Stacey 
 Here you go.  It is totally liquidated, so no one will have to worry about it anymore!!!  Stacey 
 Question re: Jeff Richter  Stacey 
 Can you take a look at this report for the West and make sure it is correct.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thanks for doing all the work!  Stacey 
 We will be having a staff meeting today.  If we can start at 12:15 rather than 12:00 that would be great because I have an 11:00 meeting.  John, What is the phone number where we can reach you?  Sorry I do not have an itinerary.  I would like to go over Doorstep findings and anything else you would like to fill me in on since we have not met in a while.  Stacey 
 Can you let them know you will be doing this.  Stacey 
 What was it?  stacey 
 Lavorato is asking why Jeff Richter still has $25MM of reserve associated to him since he has moved to EES?  How would you like me to handle this question?  Thanks, Stacey 
   I will talk to Tim re: Jeff Richter's Schedule C reserve and get back to you.  Stacey 
 The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.  The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.  Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.  I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.  Stacey 
 I agree with this request.  Stacey 
 When you get around to setting up these fields for the West, please use the portfolio code 'W' for West and then use the same methodology for Book Code that Andrea did.  I'll let you know the answer she gets from Andrew re: 'US Power East' because you should be using 'US Power West'.  Stacey 
 yes

 All I ever saw was the e-mail from the Office of the Chair.  Stacey 
 It was wonderful.  Not so excited to be back - I'm sure it will get better as the week goes on.  How was your flight?  Did you feel safer?  They want me to go on the London Doorstep in November, so I was just wondering.  Stacey 
 Thanks!  Stacey 
 Thank you!  Stacey 
 Where did she get this information?  Is it a below the line adjustment (not in the DPR)?  Stacey 
 Yes, she is actually down here right now and I am showing it to her.  Send me your names and I'll print them in color for her.  Stacey 
 I understand all the following except the Index-Option.  Why would it be treated as a Spread-Option?  Stacey 
 Wasn't sure if you had gotten this answered, but there is really no reason that should want to see this.  Stacey 
 Sounds good, I will abide.  Stacey 
 What is the latest on this?  Stacey 
 Have them go through accounting.  This is non-trading expenses.  Not our area unless it runs through the DPR.  Stacey 
 Did you send this to Kathy reeves?  She is in charge of Calgary's power risk management.  Stacey 
 Dave,  Can you please approve or reject Samantha's request.  If you are not comfortable approving it, then reject it so she can resubmit.  When I went into the system today, it said it had already been assigned to you.  Stacey 
 Wasn't sure if you had heard anything about Donnie testing for EES and EnPower.  I am not sure there is anything we need to do, just wanted to keep you in the loop.  Stacey 
 FYI - here is the 6th floor plan with my group attached to desk.  Stacey 
 I don't really like what they are suggesting either.  We'll talk Monday.  Besides, they(we) would have to get AA to sign off on half MTM half something else.  Stacey 
 You can put John as your primary and me as  your secondary.  Stacey 
 These are fine.  Hope all is well.  Stacey 
 Just FYI - Thu Pham Arnold does our Global Counterparty requests now.  Stacey 
 I forwarded this meeting to Casey.  I will be out of the office.  Stacey 
 Hopefully you will be able to make it to this.  Sorry for the inconvenience. 
 East Delivery Points for Facilities 
   Let me know what other detail you need.  Stacey 
 Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.  Please forward to all applicable traders.  Thanks, Stacey 
 As you can see from various e-mails, Samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs.  I talked to Bob yesterday and he is aware that she is there and needing something to do.  Unofficially, he said that there should be no employee changes before the end of February, so Sam should start coming to work and taking over any specific West Estate requests.  Stacey 
 We will be explaining the process to Tom Chapman for the East and Samantha Law for the West.  Stacey 
 Also, will you get Tim to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions.  Thanks, Stacey 
 You will be extremely missed!  Good luck in all your future ventures.  Stacey 
 This should answer your regional trading question.  Once again, there is nothing to physically stop them from trading in any region, but the management decision on regional trading for the East is as follows.  I do not have this same information from the West.  Stacey 
  Bob,  What is the plan for this going forward?  I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this, I am correct?  Stacey 
 Just a reminder to make sure you get Tim a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded.  We need to change trader names etc. so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible.  Stacey 
 Sounds good to me.  FYI - the option true-up was a different issue, related to the way options were being input into the system.  They had days which would fall out of the calc, not a last day of the month problem.  Stacey 
 Bob,  What is the plan for this going forward?  I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this, I am correct?  Stacey 
 I certainly do not anticipate that we will.  I hope the Estate people are designating someone for this.  I am going to look into it.  Stacey 
 Thank you. 
 I think your resume looks good.  Brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes.  He says send a resume, call or both.  Stacey 
 Power December books are final.  This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec. 31 calculation.  We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books.  Also, power books are set up as you have defined below.  Stacey 
 Will be there. 
 Thanks for the reminder.  Just an FYI - it is not babysitting when it is your own kids.  (Just kidding - wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's.)  Stacey 
 I updated the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet with the following update.  FYI - it is NSTAR!  Stacey 
 Here's what he said.... 
 Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss, who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a management position, her resume should speak for itself.  Let me know.  Stacey 
 Please update me on the answer to the following e-mail.  I am almost certain I know the answer, but would like to make sure we are all on the same page.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Roberto,  Can you please add to the m: drive a first tier directory of common.  Please let me know ASAP that this is complete.  Thanks, Stacey White Director, Power Risk Management 713-853-1870 
 Do you know if they got these same numbers from John?  Stacey 
 Make sure you talk to Casey & John.  Most of my Houston group has been out of the office either this morning or this afternoon for a UBS orientation.  Stacey 
 I will be out of the office for a UBS orientation.  Stacey 
 Do you think we should get Sonia to update this?  Stacey 
 Can you go to this meeting in the morning?  I have two others at this same time.  We can go over what they will be looking for before the meeting.  Stacey 
 kimsach@hotmail  Here you go.  There is a chance I may have to go to a UBS dinner tonight, but it might get changed to tomorrow.  If it does get changed, I will be there tonight.  Stacey 
 Thanks for the update.  I finally talked to him also.  The message you just told me, is what I communicated to Samantha.  Whenever or if ever, you find out more specifics re: Portland estate, please let me know.  Stacey 
 Sounds good to me.  The only days I don't want to meet are the 4th and 5th.  Stacey 
 According to Tim, if we could find no other spots for her to stay in Risk, she would be designated as VM and Kit Blair would be taken off the list.  Do you know what communication is being given to 'estate' employees in Portland?  Stacey 
 I have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person.  I have all of Heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her, if it has not already been communicated.  Also, please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland.  I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha.  If you want to talk to me you can reach me at 281-894-0468 or send me an e-mail.  Stacey 
 Who do we ask to set up the m:\common?  This makes the most sense to me.  Stacey 
 Thank you so much for this query.  At this time, I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet.  The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank.  However, the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value.  I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error.  There are too many variables that are unknown.  The good thing is, it works now.  Thanks, Stacey 
 So sorry to be such a bother, but I just want to make sure that you received and are frantically thinking about my message.  UBS is needing names confirmed this morning so offer letters can go out today.  Stacey 
 Home 281-412-9234 Cell 713-553-3641  Hope these are still the same.  Stacey 
 Thanks 
 The following post-id's represent the re-calcs for 11-30: 15785 - total P&L $48,108,223 15786 - total P&L $(128,887,942) 15788 - total P&L $1,168,735,362 15789 - total P&L $(101,541,449)  The total forward P&L for these post-id's should be $986,414,195  The following spreadsheets represents the final product from our request.  Please see if you can pull by the parameters we chose from AdHoc.    Stacey 
 Can Cecilia do what she has requested below?  Stacey 
 It looks good for me.  There are a couple of applications I do not have access to.  Let me know what method you would like me to take in requesting access.  Stacey 
 You will LOVE this!  Stacey 
 Have you told Kathy about this transfer?  Should it be a bankruptcy book?  Stacey 
 have you forwarded to John, or do I need to? 
 Are they working on it? 
 Yes, thank you.  How much do I owe you?  Stacey 
 I totally agree!!  Stacey 
 Did y'all export, etc.?  Stacey 
 Can you update the original file you sent with Bryce's changes below.  I am afraid I do not understand exactly what I should change on Sequent.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Hope all is well.  My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com  The one you have will be decommissioned shortly.  I still have a job and will more than likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business.  Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with you?  Stacey  If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.  713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang. 
 Can you all verify that you do or do not use the applications listed below as soon as possible.  We are in the process of moving or discarding applications to move to the NETCO environment and are unaware of who uses the following applications.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Thought you were moving this meeting to 3:00.  Jeff and I have a meeting with UBS from 1:00-2:30.  Stacey
