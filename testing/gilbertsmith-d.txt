 New deals. May try and bring a couple of deals over but not sure what the wrkings of that will look like.  Doug Doug-Gilbert Smith 
 I expect we will look to qualify asap but that we can use the apx if need be. I was not looking to trade too much physical up front instead, looking to build positions so that they go to phys delivery around the same time we are set up. There are some significant deals that we require us certified quickly and I do not see that being a problem.  I will be in in the morning if you want to catch me then.  Take care,  Doug Doug-Gilbert Smith

  Let me know if you have any questions. The correlations are approximate but I do not expect too much deviation from these numbers.  Thanks,  Doug 
 great.  Where you want to meet at 10? 
 no problem. Likewise, I would like to be kept in touch with what you guys are up to as well.  Thanks,  Doug 
 Frank,  how do you want the power measured for your liquidity matrix? I also want to make sure that the correlations, while independently calced, are accurate.  Let me know,  Thanks,  Doug 
 need help-I do not manage a stack right now but will be in a couple of weeks.  Thanks,  Doug
