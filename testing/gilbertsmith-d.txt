  Let me know if you have any questions. The correlations are approximate but I do not expect too much deviation from these numbers.  Thanks,  Doug

 no problem. Likewise, I would like to be kept in touch with what you guys are up to as well.  Thanks,  Doug 
 Frank,  how do you want the power measured for your liquidity matrix? I also want to make sure that the correlations, while independently calced, are accurate.  Let me know,  Thanks,  Doug
