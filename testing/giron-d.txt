want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and married and jointly.  I hope that made sense.  DG 
 A W4 calculates how much federal tax to withhold from your paycheck each pay period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There is really no good or bad answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on April 15th, then claim more dependents and married and jointly.  If you don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  I hope that made sense.  DG 
 Put me down for the 15th also.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573    Enron North America Corp. 
 Eric, I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal. She ran the transport book at that time.  The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.  I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.  DG    3-9573 
 I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.  We had a great time.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.  It was cold but the game was fun.  It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they did.  We will try and make it a regular trip.  We also spoke about maybe getting together in Dallas sometime next year.  I need to go, but will talk to you later.  D 
 Jennifer, The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further questions.  DG 
 Here is another one.  It will be another Chicago book.  We will never officialize the book.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Susan,  I believe this is all of the Enovate/EMW books that are officialized each night.  IM-EMWNSS1-PRC IM-EMWNSS1-BAS IM-EMWNSS1-IDX IM-EMWNSS1-PHY IM-EMWNSS2-PRC IM-EMWNSS2-BAS IM-EMWNSS2-IDX IM-EMWNSS2-PHY FT-IM-ENOV-PRC FT-IM-ENOV-BAS FT-IM-ENOV-IDX FT-IM-ENOV-GDL FT-IM-ENOV-PHY INTRA-ENOV-PRC INTRA-ENOV-BAS INTRA-ENOV-IDX INTRA-ENOV-PHY TP-EMWNSS-PRC TP-EMWNSS-BAS TP-EMWNSS-IDX  Call me with any questions.  DG    3-9573 
 OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout is as follows:  Group1   Group2 Carole    Jennifer Jason    Anne Chris  Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.  DG 
 Frank, Attached is my PBA nomination for Anne Bike.  Let me know if I left anything out, or need to do anything else.  Thanks, DG 
 Connie,  I believe I misinterpreted your request.  I have updated the list to include every book we officialize each night.  DG    3-9573 
 Connie,  I appologize for the tardiness of this list.  I was out of the office last Thursday and Friday.  Please call if you have any questions.  DG    3-9573 
 Yes  DG 
 It's done.  I appologize for this taking so long.  It won't happen again.  DG    3-9573 
 Don't worry about picking us up at the airport.  I will be careful and brave the elements.  See you tomorrow.  DG 
 Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand if you want to stop the sessions.  Thanks.  DG 
 Will,  Jennifer Bagwell Jason Wolfe Chris Walker Anne Bike Carole Frank  DG 
 I see Jennifer Bagwell in the system, but not Christopher Walker.  DG    3-9573 
 Me and the kids get in at 10am, Kristi has to stay a little later for work and will be in at 3pm.  I was also thinking we could buy tickets at the stadium.  Don't worry about not taking time off.  See you Thursday.  DG 
 One more for you.  Because you're special.  DG 
 Please get this info to me and I will pass it on to AA.  Thanks.  DG 
 Sharon,  We Schedule C'd the $50M difference.  Let me know if you need further info or backup.  Thanks.  DG   3-9573 
 I can't believe it is already time for our trip up to Kansas.  We are arriving on Thursday morning and returning on Sunday morning.  Other than the game on Saturday, we don't have any plans.  See you soon.  DG 
 The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.  Because of work commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.  The 3 of us will get a rental car and make our way to your place.  Are you going to be home then?  Then we will go pick up Kristi later.  We have no plans at the moment (other than going to the game on Saturday).  We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time, though, 6:30am.  They didn't give me many options using reward travel.  We are all looking forward to the trip.  See you on Thursday.  DG 
 Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know?  DG 
 Jeremy, I can calc postids for FT-NW but cannot print.  Please help.  Thanks. DG    3-9573 
 Sharon,  I missplaced the info we were speaking about yesterday.  Please send it to me again so I can follow up.  Thanks.  DG 
 On election day, you have to vote in your own precinct.  You need to find your precinct number and then you can find the location on the web. DG 
 Hector, Kimberly S. Olinger is listed as reporting to me in the PEP system.  She should be moved to Jeff Gossett.  Thanks. DG    Enron North America Corp. 
 The first email was what I sent to Burton and Susan.  This is the confirmation from them that the book was set up.  DG    3-9573 
 Thanks.  You can tell Phillip I'll have it fixed when I return on Monday.  DG 
 We are flying in on Thursday.  We plan on renting a car and driving to your place.  I'll update you on specific times early next week.  Because me and the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on the same flight that the three of us are on.  We are all looking forward to seeing you.  DG 
 Jeremy,  I don't have access to run this book.  Will you please get me authorization? Thanks.  DG 
 Let's make sure we are doing this every night.  I think Jason has been running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last person finished do it every day.  I sure can crank out the emails when I get some uninterrupted time to myself!  DG 
 I am in Chicago today and tomorrow.  I will look at this more while I am here.  DG 
 I can't remember if I forwarded this to you already.  Thanks.  DG 
 Will you two please get this info to Dutch.  Thanks.  DG 
 How was your morning?  I hope not too bad.  I didn't get to sleep until 3am. I miss you and love you.  D 
 11:30am it is  DG 
 Please add Carole Frank to the list.  Her NT username is cfrank2.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 What time are you arriving on Friday?  We got box seats to the Bears game on Sunday.  DG 
 Kathy,  I don't think I will be able to make our meeting tomorrow.  Can we pick it up again next week?  Thanks.  DG 
 I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado, you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country.  And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance. They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team. But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU. They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.  DG 
 Here's what happened. 
 This deal was EOL ID 520766 on the 25th.  Neither the Sitara or EOL number is in Tagg.  Please update the deal with the EOL and Sitara number.  It is very important that you always put this information in Tagg.  In addition, make sure you are updating Sitara with the Tagg numbers as well.  Thanks.  DG 
 Yes  DG 
 I thought you might like this.  Do you have a ticket to Chicago yet?  I don't think Jenny will have any luck getting hired in Risk.  We pretty much rule anyone out without prior experience unless they are internal candidates. However, I have forwarded her resume to Settlements and Volume Management.  I think she should get a call from them.  How's life in Dallas?  Also, what is your new cell number.  The Houston Cellular number no longer works.  DG 
 What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?  Either at night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.  Maybe four times a week.  Running and some weights in the garage.  I would really like to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this. I love you.  D 
 You can start asking me about the West desk.  We don't have any new books for this month.  DG    3-9573 
 This book is for the West desk.  Please call if you have any questions. 
 Mom, Are you leaving on Saturday or Sunday?  I thought yesterday you said Saturday.  I feel much older today. DG 
 I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.  The reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question is 06/00.  When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price. And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct. Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Burton,  INTRA-EMWNSS1 INTRA-EMWNSS2 FT-IM-ENOV INTRA-ENOV TP-EMWNSS  Call if you have any further questions.  DG    3-9573 
 We have some new procedures for changing deals that affect other books. Please read and let me know if you have any further questions.  You don't need to request minibook access individually.  I have, so if needed we can run them on my machine.  Thanks.
