ith the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.  I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.  DG 
 I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So just disregard that suggestion.  I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.  It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.  DG 
 I am happy with my seats.  I just wanted to make sure you were willing to continue allowing me to buy them through you long term.  See you Saturday.  They should be pretty good this year.  But I've certainly heard that before!  DG 
 You're welcome.  It's really no problem at all.  I want to see them succeed.  DG 
 Here it is.  Let me know what you think.  DG 
 No Gulf Coast?  DG

 They are going to install the system on 9/29 (9am-11am).  My brother-in-law got it recently and seems to like it.  He lives even further away from the city than me, so it should be OK.  See ya.  DG 
 Do you have any xtras for the above referenced.  I'm just looking for one for Tech, but as many as 6 for Kansas.  Thanks.  DG 
 More than 6,000 (more than 4,000 American citizens) innocent civilians have been killed in a brutal attack on our country and our way of life.  If that is not worth fighting for, then what in your opinion is?  I will admit, I am a conservative and therefore our opinions will usually be polarized on many issues.  I am glad that life in our country allows for dissent.  But I think that this right is worth the ulimate sacrifice.  I honestly believe that if we do not respond, and with calculated deadly force, that we ultimately lose.  And I am not talking about losing a war, but our freedom.  I agree with you that war will bring unintended consequenses, but these consequences in my opinion, are the price we must pay to defend our way of life.  Darron Giron 
 Congratulations on the latest member of the family.  Kim sent me an email with website address that has the pictures.  I hope everyone is doing well.  Take care.  DG 
 I just got the latest and greatest:  Shively Storey Lewis Pimenov Mahmassani Williams  Assuming this is accurate, I would like to get from you, as soon as the decisions have been made, what products/regions each trader will be assigned to.  This is not only for EOL setup, but also for curve files and P&L/Position reporting.  There will be two people, not including myself to run the Central books, so I also need to begin thinking about who will be running each book.  Thanks.  DG 
 Let me know what you think.  Please add any changes you want.  DG 
 Irena, Please print the attached file on Enron letterhead and give it to Carole.  Thanks.  DG 
 Thank you.  That was quick.  DG 
 I would like to know my seat location when it has been assigned. I ordered 4 tickets.  Thanks.  Darron Giron 
 I remembered to bring them.  Maybe we can get together later today.  DG

 Well, have you been taken care of????????  DG 
 Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was going, it would be Zydeco all the way!  DG 
 Anne, It looks like Crosstimbers had a phys trade with us at NWPL Rox + $.025 and they also had fin trades (Nymex and Basis).  We combined them to essentially make Jan01 a fixed price deal.  It appears the customer is questioning this.  Why they are 8 months after settlement date, I have no idea.  I already spoke with Carole about this and she has the deal tickets but if you have any questions, just ask.  Megan, Anne should be able to explain this to you.  She runs the West desk now.  DG 
 Diane,  Heartland Energy Group, Inc. We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3  Twister Gas Services, LLC This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7  I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.  DG 3-9573

 That sounds very bad.  Did I read that correctly?  It basically says that the series is on the brink of collapse.  DG

 Thanks.  We had a great time and are already looking forward to Jazz Fest.  DG 
 The current exemption is $675,000.  So that means that the first $675,000 of an estate is tax free.  Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.  So the effective rate will be a little lower.  The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.  This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.  Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.  I'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients.  Chris loves it when you are at his games.  He was pretty proud of his play at second base.  D 
 Maybe you should stump for president of the series.  Actually, that would be a great job.  You couldn't do much worse, it seems.   DG 
 I don't mean to hound you, but the customer is asking.  Any luck on completing this?  Please let me know.  Thanks  DG 
 Thanks.  DG 
 I have to leave the office early for a trip with Bryant and won't be back until Monday.  DG 
 I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  For Twister, the payment we made on 9/26 ($116,700) corresponds to all five (three partial and two full) terminations.  DG 
 Thanks.  Did you get it signed?  DG 
 Looks like this was made more difficult than it needed to be.  The customer wanted a termination letter and because of this we need to kill these deals.  I should have just killed the deals in the first place.  Sorry for the extra work.  DG 
 Are you still planning to come down?  I need to get a head count because tickets are sometimes tough to come by.  Let me know.  DG 
 Elena,  Yesterday's list of in the money CP's did not change.  We will forward a list of out of the money CP's shortly.  We will also send IT the list so that they can begin moving them to another book.  There are appox 140 CP's so the move will take some time.  DG 
 Will you please ask this person doing Diane's work if the termination letter was completed?  Thanks.  DG

 I just wanted to remind you how much we love you and appreciate everything you do for us.  I hope you have a great day.  Only 6 more to go.  I saw where Sears is laying off over 4,900 salaried jobs.  I hope Jan is unaffected.  This economy really is starting to get me worried.  I love you.  D 
 I didn't go to Colorado.  My son had a baseball game and I had been out of town over the weekends lately so we sold the tickets.  They did look pretty good, and could have really blown them out if Sims had been just a little more accurate in the second half.  But I'm not complaining.  I think Brown really made a mistake by going with Ivan Williams against OK.  He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.  I think the next three are locks.  Then it comes down to T+1.  I don't care how average they may be, UT has won exactly 1 game at Kyle since 1983 (8 games).  Texas should be very good next year.  The only problem area I see is the OL.  I just sent an email to Kyle about lunch.  Let's do it.  ENE is a piece of shit.  That's really all there is to say about that.  DG 
 John, Enron's NYMEZ offer for the following volume is $3.115:  Contracts Feb-02	18 Mar-02	29 Apr-02	52 May-02	42 Jun-02	79 Jul-02	94 Aug-02	109 Sep-02	81 Oct-02	36 Nov-02	45 Dec-02	45 Total	630  As I stated in our phone conversation, this offer would be contingent on my ability to clear an internal hurdle.  We do not have an ISDA in place and I am waiting for a reply from our credit department on the best course of action to take.  Thanks for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Darron Giron 713-853-9573 
 I think Phillip is dead serious about trying to start a business.  Enron's stock is down sharply again today.  It's trading at $16.  Remember in March we got out at $71.  My options are now $68 out of the money and it will be at least 3 years before they will approach breakeven.  If I seem depressed lately, that's why.  Anyway, I love you.  D 
 I didn't have an exact email address for Kent, so I guessed.  kkopetzy@utilicorp.com  It was just returned undeliverable.  Please forward the info to him.  Thanks.  DG 
 This is done.  DG 
 I just cancelled it.  We need to let people and companies that the address has changed.  D 
 Reagan,  Lucy wanted me to let you know that I will be handling Utilicorp from the gas end.  It is a territorial issue.  I gave John a quote on the Cal 02 strip and am following up with credit because we don't have an ISDA in place with them.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance on your end.  Thanks.  DG 
 First, what the hell are you doing working at 12:09am?  Second, it obiously will, but to what extent I'm not sure yet.  See ya.  DG

 Transaction ID 610 Product ID 35729 did not book correctly.  It is a two leg deal.  The first leg is a GD index deal and the price component has the wrong book.  It has AB-PWR-ST-GD and should be FB-CENT2.  The second leg is a F4F deal and it put the wrong value in the price component and basis component.  Previous nights price settle should be in price and $.02 should be in basis.  The deal has $.02 in price and $.00 in basis.  DG 
 I put Storey for all of Ruscitti's products.  DG 
 OK.  Sometimes the CFISD mail server is very slow and messages get returned.  I'll tell her.  D 
 Diane, I have another termination for you.  We killed Y30499.1 and Y55771.1 and made a payment of $94,200 on 10/29/01 which is booked on Y30449.3.  Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thanks.  DG 3-9573

 Directions to our house: 1) I-45 to I-35E North at downtown 2) North on I-35E to 183 West. 3) 183 West splits at Texas Stadium. Take 114 West. 4) Take 114 West to 121 North. 4) North on Highway 121 to Highway 2499 North. 5) Take 2499 North through three traffic lights. 6) After the three lights, you will go a 2-3 miles and see a small offfice park on the left called Fountain Place or Fountain Park. 7) Immediately after passing the office park take the next left -  Spinks St. 8) Take an immediate left on Surrey. You will see the housing development at this point. 9) Take the next right on Solano. 10) Take the next left on Crestfield. 11) Take the next left on Stillwater Ct. 12) We are the fourth house on the left.   2604 Stillwater Ct.

 Congratulations!  Enron will most likely file Ch 11.  Either today or tomorrow.  It's pretty crazy.  I really don't know what the future holds.  I will just have to wait and see.  We definitely want to go skiing.  Most likely in the spring.  I may have to wait and see how this thing plays out though.  I am going to Dallas on Saturday and we may stay at your sisters place.  They sure kicked the shit out of the Huskers.  I'll keep in touch.  DG 
 you got one?  DG 
 Absoulutely.  When the Texas Monthly article came out, ENE was around $30.  We have been told basically nothing.  Which is not unlike what has been going on during the entire collapse........At least they are consistent.  But we did have attorneys describing what Ch 11 would be like, so I suspect it is only a matter of time until the filling.  We shall see.  DG 
 We are going to Dallas.  I bought the tickets the week of the OU game.  Thought I would be selling them until last Sat evening.  I think a 5% chance at Pasadena.  I think it comes down to Miami-VT.  Florida should cruise at home against Tenn and anyone in the SEC west on the carpet in Atlanta.  But stranger things have happened........  DG

 Cecilia, In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.  DG 
 Attached is a long list of counterparty names to move from NG-PRICE into ENA-WT-SOCAL.  Please move only financial deals only.  Please let me know when this is complete.  Thanks.  DG

 Sorry to hear that.  I hope everything goes well at work.  My company is crumbling.  It's pretty scary.  A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.  I ended up getting a cable modem.  I really didn't want to do that because I absolutely hate Time Warner.  And what do you know, they screwed up my first bill.  DG 
 Carl, I see if I can pull this information together for you.  I'll let you know later today.  Thanks DG 
 It probably goes without saying, but just face for the two tix again.  DG 
 The file was too big to email.  It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.  It does not contain any option deals.  I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.  DG 
 No.  We are going up without tickets.  People who have been say there are usually plenty available.  Don't worry about the $.  I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.  The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.  But the fun thing about it is I really don't care who wins.  DG 
 Carl, I was traveling on Friday.  The Doubletree is the closest.  I'll get you a number.  Dinner on Monday is a good idea.  If you have a 5:30pm flight, leaving the office at 3:00pm will give you enough time to return a car and get to the terminal. DG

 Here is the file.  It contains only financial trades in the active NG-PRICE book.  Also these are only Price, Basis, Index, and Gas Daily values.  They don't contain any Options.

 Yes, by Skilling mostly.  I can't believe that a handful of people brought the company all the way down to the point of bankruptcy.  Basically, they took all the money that the core businesses made and pissed it all away in poor investments (broadband, India, Azurix, etc...)  I just hope I have a job thru the holidays.  I feel vulnerable because I'm the new one in this group.  I would feel more secure if I was still in risk.  Oh well, I guess it's wait and see.  DG 
 Carl, I was supposed to be traveling this morning, but because of the crash in NY it has been postponed to tomorrow.  I will be in a Dallas airport at the time of our call tomorrow morning.  Should I use 763-241-2490 as the number to use for our conference call?  If not, let me know.  I look forward to our conversation.  Thanks  DG 
 Thanks Carl.  I'll call your number @ 10am tomorrow.  DG 
 I was sorry to hear about your mother.  I tried to call last night but you were not at home.  I told mom and she asked for your number.  I don't know if you have heard, but Enron was purchased by Dynegy on Friday.  The deal will not close until Q3 '02, but this will obviously affect me in some manner.  We will see.  Take care.  DG 
 Thanks.  I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.  I just talked to him.  Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.  I'm glad you like it over there.  I guess it's just wait and see.  DG 
 I was out of the office on Friday.  I'll call you later this morning with a quote.  Thanks.  DG

 Patrick, Terry Brownrig and I did a small phys basis deal this afternoon.  It was 988/d ANR/SW we are selling @ NX1 - $.155  He called later saying he may want to also do a Jan02-Mar02 deal also.  This is just giving you a headsup for when he calls.  If so, you would need to get the quote from Andy.  Have a good Thanksgiving.  DG 281-304-8303 Home 832-524-6091 Cell 
 Good.  The game is in Irving, so I will try to find a hotel around there.  It is also at 7:00pm.  We will get into town early so we can come by and see you guys.  You moved to a new house, right?  I'll keep you posted.  DG 
 Please take notice of the red cells.  These Tagg numbers were incorrect and I have changed the cells to the correct Tagg deal number.  All of the deals on this list have been moved to the bankrupcy book.   DG 
 I bought the tickets the week of the Texas-OU game.  Up until Sat night, I was planning on selling them to a guy I work with who went to OU.  I never thought about a hotel because I really never thought UT would be in the game.  I really don't want to put you guys out, especially with a new baby.  We are bringing Christopher (he is really excited about going) and a high school aged neighbor (his girlfriend's brother is on the team).  If you truly don't mind, then I will talk to Kristi about it.  We'll see.  How's the new house?  Is Flower Mound a little west of Lewisville?  I'm not good on Dallas geography.  DG 
 I just talked to Kristi.  She said no way we are staying with you because of the baby.  She is pissed I thought abour taking you up on your offer.  I am in trouble.  DG 
 His list does not include any of the transport positions.  It also includes some deals with the Chicago office that should not be included in the deal value.  DG 
 This is it.  I am leaving the office for the rest of the morning.  I will return after lunch.  DG 
 This is it.  It should be self explanatory.  There are values for Jan02 and Feb02 in the file.  The value increased a little more than I expected.  I didn't have time to compare the numbers from my last run at it in December.  I will in the morning.  I also still need to find the true value on the weather deal.  DG 
 I'm in.  I'll be shredding 'till 11am so I should have plenty of time to make it.  DG 
 Could you send me a tracking number for the speakers.  I still haven't received them.  Thanks.  DG 
 This is the last file I sent Dierdre.  It has four tabs.  One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).  The monthly values are PV'd.  The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.  The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).  The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.  Transport is just that.  I hope this helps.  DG 
 thanks  DG 
 It's pretty sappy.......but I think you will enjoy it.   DG 
 Done  DG 
 Yes.  I talked to Carlos yesterday so I'm pretty sure he is too.  I'm just waiting on the fallout from the UBS purchase of my organization.  It is supposed to be in front of the bankruptcy court today.  I'll let you know.  Carley has learned to ride her bike.  She is pretty excited about it.  We will come see you this weekend.  DG 
 Here is a link to the schedule.  http://astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/news/hou_news_story.jsp?GXHC_gx_session_id_=5205ad314fc66af4&article_id=hou_20011213_collegeclassic_news&team_id=hou 
 I'm still here.  I saw where they got the QB from Madison as well.  Maybe we can get together for lunch early next week.  Let me know.  DG 
 As long as accounting doesn't have a problem with it, I don't see why not.  The P&L will probably need to be redone for the 31st (Jan) and 1st (Feb).  It just depends on what deals change.  If it is only annuities, then only last day will need to be recalced.  DG 
 I just wanted to drop you a note and ask what's going on and what you plan on doing.  I hope all is well and that you had a good Holiday under the circumstances.  Take care.  DG 
 The HB was pretty wild.  We went to the Big XII CG.  Good game, bummer outcome.  I think I would like to start the 529 plan for each kid.  Can I transfer either the custodial or Ed IRA $$??  I just tried to call, but no one answered.  With all the craziness here, I'm not sitting by my phone.  If you call, ask the person to messenger me.  DG 
 It looks like the Lagrasta deals are valued at -$7.6 million on ENE's books.  I attached the file.  I'm still working on the weather deal.  DG 
 Haven't moved my phone yet.  Until then, tell the person who answers my # to messenger me to call you back. 
 I'll be there.  DG 
 I'll be there.  DG 
 The one I just sent had some East products.  DG 
 The GD Options (both calls and puts) are booked year round.  They are all in N17872.9, N17872.A, N17872.B, N18064.6, and N18254.4.  I will begin looking at the unwind problem.  DG 
 Attached is a file that has all of the Central Region EOL products.  EOL needs to reassign trader names and books to these products.  I realize that not all products will initially be active, but we are in the process of getting everything ready for the restart of trading business.  Just put a trader name in column H for the corresponding EOL product.  If you have any q
