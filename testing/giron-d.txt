 You going to the game?  Let me know.  DG 
 I am in the process of getting these deals valued.  I know what we have booked in Tagg as of now, but need to reconcile it to what People's has booked.  I got something from Steve last time I was up, but it does not have deal terms.  Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal? I don't even know his last name.  Thanks.  DG 
 Will you please send Richard Tomaski a version of yesterday's DPR that can be printed or forwarded.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Find anything good?  I love you.  D 
 The deal was entered twice.  I killed 279644.  I spoke with Michael, and he knows the deal has been killed.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 I hope you have a great day.  I love you.  D 
 Did you grant the $750 in orig from the ticket I gave you yesterday?  Let me know.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Susan,  Do you have a ticket for the above referenced deal?  I am trying to find Sitara numbers, but I don't have a ticket for the deal.  Let me know.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 You should see this from Luchas tonight.  DG    Enron North America Corp. 
 I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.  Sorry.  Like I said yesterday, I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.  I just need to follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also working on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, and liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the Trunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain the deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the meeting today.  DG    3-9573 
 Kristi wanted me to send you a note saying we will be there for the game on Saturday.  See you there.  DG 
 After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of questions.  So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.  I was hoping to get this done today.  But for sure by the end of the week.  I want to ask you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.  See you at 1:00.  DG 
 I'll see you at 1:00  DG 
 Yes.  Just after lunch if possible.  It's bid week.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.  I also don't receive statements in the mail for the account.  It looks as if the automated transactions worked this month.  DG 
 How was class?  I'll see you tonight.  D 
 OK 
 Remember to look at your school schedule so we can book our flights to Kansas.  D 
 How did everything go this AM?  I hope well.  Today is you're first day of class, right?  Have a good day.  I love you.  D 
 Daniel, Laura Luce would like to send the latest Enovate DPR to the chairman of People's Corp.  But the copies we receive have some sort of protection which I'm sure you are aware of.  Will you please send her the latest so that she can forward it to this guy?  Let me know if that is a problem.  Thanks.  DG  I am in Chicago today. 312-541-1198 
 He started to cry last night when you said you were not going to sign him up.  I think we can.  Starting Sep 1, I will not be running a book.  I will be able to leave at a decent hour on scheduled days.  So I will be able to help.  Let me know what you think.  DG 
 I'm in the office.  You need to look a a calendar to see when you can come up here.  Hopefully for a weekend the Cubs are in town.  I love you.  DG 
 Lee, after I put in the deals, the system went down and I was not able to get them to calc.  So they are not in these numbers.  They will be tonight.  See you guys later today.  DG 
 Could you please follow up on this.  Thanks.  DG 
 I'll try it. 1.I have heard this before, but just can't remember 2.Niagra Falls 3.No idea.  Probably something like rubarb 4.Baseball 5.Strawberry 6.They put the bottle on the pear when it is little and tie it to the tree.

 I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.  I held back $1,087,409 from the MEH book.  The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was $20K added to the P&L last Friday.  I did not add that amount back in tonight.  I don't know what it is.  I'll talk to you in the morning.  Let me know if there is something you want me to send you.  Thanks.  DG 
 Well, I hate to write this, but I found out last night that I will have to be in Chicago next Wednesday thru Friday.  Call me.  DG 3-9573 
 Thanks.  I'm obviously not very observant.  DG 
 I didn't get a good response from the one person I know in IT.  So I am sending your resume out for some IT jobs I see posted on our intranet and have asked for help from the HR dept.  I didn't think this would take so long.  I appologize, but I am still trying.  DG 
 I have a friend who is looking to change employers.  He is in the IT field. I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.  Although, he would be interested in any similar job.  I will attach his resume.  What is the best way to get his resume in front of the proper people?  I would appreciate your opinion.  I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron that does.  Thanks in advance for your help.  DG 3-9573 
 Kevin,  I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.  Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for every EOL deal Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, just let me know and I'll follow up.  Thanks.  DG 
 Gary, We need to have two more books created as soon as possible.  These need to be set up the same as the others(not as PA books) Kam requested (moving from and Intra book to an FT book).  FT-INT-CNT-TRANS FT-INT-EMWMEH  Call if you have any questions.  Thanks   DG 3-9573 
 I told Dawn already, but my brother is getting married on the 16th.  We can't make it.  DG 
 I love you 
 Kim,  How are you?  I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it worked.  I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on taking the whole group up for the KU-UT game.  I hope you will be in town as well.  Let me know.  Take care.  DG 
 Uncle Clark,  How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to seeing you all.  DG

 We are definately going skiing this winter.  We have not been for over two years.  I also want the kids to start skiing.  Send all of your sisters if you have them.  I'll put them in my address book and won't have to keep bugging you.  Take care.  DG 
 Sean,  How's CO?  I hope you are doing well.  I know I have asked you before, but I seem to have accidentally deleted your dad and sister's email addresses.  I want to ask you dad if he will be in town when KU plays Texas later in November.  I want to bring the whole family.  If you get a chance, shoot me a message with his info.  My mom is vacationing in NY so I can't ask her. Thanks.  DG 
 I got it shortly after I emailed.  Thanks.  DG 
 Jay,  Have you initiated the purchases in my Roth IRA?  I don't see the pending purchases online.  Thanks.  DG 
 The new exchange deals for the EMW Park & Loan are 350499 and 350511.  DG  3-9573 
 Have you heard about this?  DG 
 I changed the counterparty name in Tagg  DG 
 Do you have rooms available for 9/15 & 9/16?  If so what are the rates for a room with a double bed?  Thanks.  DG 713-853-9573 
 I have not received a response.  Please help.  DG ES935566 713-853-9573 
 Gregg, I used the following counterparties in the query:  Central Illinois Public Service Company Central Illinois Light Company Illinois Power Company Northern Indiana Public Service Company Nicor, Inc. Nicor Energy LLC. Nicor Enerchange LLC. Nicor Gas Company Nicor Gas Marketing Company Nipsco Industries, Inc. Nipsco Energy Services, Inc. NiSource Capital Markets, Inc.  The only deals I came up with were with Nicor.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call me.  DG    3-9573 
 Please send me the Meta ID.  I don't remember it.  I want to make sure we have covered all of the counterparties.  Thanks.  DG

 Last Friday I was trying to get into my account online but couldn't remember my password.  After three unsuccesful attempts the system locked me out.  I know my password now, but I am still locked out.  Please help.  DG ES935566 713-853-9573 
 Jay,  I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.  DG 
 I'm in Chicago again.  I return this afternoon.  DG 
 Glad you had a good time.  Next time we will have both SeaDo's working and hopefully the lake will be a little higher.  We have your sandals.  At least I think they are yours.  I am in Chicago right now.  We will try and get them to you soon.  Use dgiron@enron.com for my email address.  DG

 It seems as if I have caused some confusion.  Last night's email attachment was the P&L that did not include People's or Origination's share of the total.  Currently attached is the P&L that was signed off on last night.  If you have any questions, please call.  DG    3-9573

 Drew,  Here is Agave for June.  I also made a change to May.  I was calculating the differential off of the wrong location index.  DG 
 I was wondering why you were waiting so long to respond.  I'm glad he is staying.  I think it says something about his commitment to the program he built.  It also says a little about the Big XII.  How are things in CO?  I'm in Chicago now but am heading for LA later this afternoon for Carlos&Y's shower.  Take care.  DG 
 I am in Chicago right now and will not return until Monday.  DG 
 I have been in Chigago for the last two weeks.  The CD is in my desk in Houston.  What is your location?  I can have it sent via intercompany mail. Sorry about this.  DG 
 So who is the next Jayhawk coach going to be?  DG 
 Audrey,  I'm in Chicago now but I need to ask you some questions about a few Sitara deals.  They are 298277, 298283, and 298296.  They are between EPMI and EMW. Are these deasl going to be settled by Unify?  Do we currently see Unify invoices/verifications for EMW or EPMI?  Thanks.  DG 
 It looks better.   DG 
 Any word on a stock for Carley's custodial account?  Also, I would like to talk about selling the Dell in my IRA and diversify some.  Let me know what you think.  I'm in Chicago and am returning on Friday afternoon.  I can check my email.  Thanks.  DG 
 I wanted to show you when I sent this and how long it took to set it up.  Go home before 11pm today!  DG 
 Sure.  You know how to reach me.  I'll be back in the office on Monday. DG 
 Stephanie,  We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.  Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North  Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this request.  Thanks for your help.  DG    3-9573 
 Done.  DG 
 Gabriel, We recognized a total of $9,488 of Orig last night.  All from FT-Central.  Is the $468 from another book?  DG    3-9573 
 Thanks.  Sorry , I seem to be taking up alot of your time lately!  DG    3-9573 
 Does this mean that the two new Sitara books I requested are complete?  I looked in Sitara and could not find the new names.  Please let me know. Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Gary, We need to add a new book in Tagg.  Kam suggested I send the request to you. Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573

 Jay,  I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed to me.  I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th of each month if possible.  I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175 transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).  Please help.  Thanks.  DG 713-853-9573 
 Imelda,  Please change the subregion code for all ANR ML5 deals from Market to Midcon.  Also, the curve mapping needs to be changed as well.  Intramonth IF-ANR/OK Mid Market IF-ANR/OK Gas Daily GDP-ANR/OK  If you have any questions, please call.  Also, will you please send me the latest version of the Central curve mappings.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 On second thought, it might be easier to allow the two books to have deals on any Central pipe.  We will make sure that the deals are on the correct counterparty (North or South)  DG    3-9573

 We need to break out our Midcon region into two separate books starting with July production.  We did this with the Market region a couple of months ago. If possible, I would like to use these two names:  ENA-IM Mid Central South ENA-IM Mid Central North  Please let me know what needs to be done in order to expedite this request. Thanks.

 Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.  I actually have already done this on the web.  What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase of APGCX for $340 begining this month.  Also, any idea if I am going to receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?  I noticed online that  the Roths are now zero.  Thanks.  DG

 Jeff, If we give these reviews in late Jan or Feb of next year, I think I could review Chris, Jason, Anne, and Jennifer.  I don't think I should review Dawn, Greg, or Kim.

 You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good. I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.  You can also just put your own package together.  If you do this make sure the speakers are of the same brand.  This is what I did for Scott.  Many of the speaker packages use  5 small speakers and a sub.  But I suggested larger front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.  Any decent receiver will have a decoder built in.  And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on how much you are willing to spend.  I'll go through my stash of magazines tonight and see what I can find for you to read.  DG 
 We are updating the pricing today.  I'll let you know when it's finished.  DG 
 I changed the deal to $14,028  DG 
 We granted a total of $320K ($220K to you and $100K to credit reserve) by mistake.  We will take the extra $100K in orig from you tonight.  I appologize for the error.  DG 
 No, I sent the email to you by mistake.  We will be at Sheri's tomorrow.  How do you know her?  Is it through Dawn?  When Sheri sent the message to everyone, I noticed your name on the list and called to ask, but you didn't pick up, and I didn't leave a message.  DG 
 I won't blame you if you don't get that requested info to me.  I migrated to Windows 2000 and it had an old address book.  Sorry.  DG

 Irena,  One thing that would help me out the most is when new people start in the group, we have all of their applications and passwords ready to go.  Other than that, I think you guys do a great job.  Thanks.  DG 
 Everything is OK over here.  I heard about the spring game.  31K is alot of people for a game that doesn't count.  Who is buying your company?  If it goes south, I'm sure I can get you on over here.  Let me know how it turns out.  We need to get together for lunch again.  Can you on Friday?  DG
