 The position will actually report to me.  You can change it.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573    Enron North America Corp. 
 Toni, Please let me know if I left anything out.  Thanks for your help.  DG    3-9573 
 Not West deals.  DG 
 Don't worry about how good you are.  I'm terrible also.  I've put you down as playing.  I'll keep you posted.  DG    3-9573 
 Yes.  I have 3 total so far.  I'll keep you posted.  DG    3-9573 
 I told her we would go.  D 
 We'll see you there.  DG    3-9573 
 I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill. In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if anyone was interested.  Let me know.  DG    3-9573 
 A GC for either $ or for one of those Day Spas.  DG 
 I hope you have a good day back at school.  I love you.  D 
 I'll try and find out today.  D 
 Russell,  These are all of our book names:  GD-NEW GD-NEWJR FT-WEST FT-NORTHWEST MGMT-WEST WEST-NW WEST-SW WEST-PERM WEST-SJ  For Basis, add  -BAS to the end of the book name.  For Gas Daily, add  -GDL to the end of the book name.  Call me if you have any questions.  DG    3-9573 
 Russ,  I got this from Regina just before she changed groups.  DG    3-9573 
 Uncle Clark,  It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.  Darron 
 Done.  I did the 1999 changes as well.  DG    3-9573 
 I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.  His answer was the same.  There were more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was stronger.  Thanks.  DG 
 Russell, Here are our portfolio and book codes: Port Book 1 Q G G E # L A 4 5 P A  Call me if you have any questions.  DG    3-9573 
 Kathy, I tried calling but could not get you or your voicemail.  Tomorrow is the first day of bidweek and I also have some other meetings to attend.  I think we need to skip this week and pick up next Tuesday.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  DG 
 P&L is OK.  Open position is 39.0 contracts.  DG 
 In addition:  expert clauses - which ones need to be changed, when and why - what are reversals and why we use them - how to check physical prompt month value for potential errors - how to calculate physical prompt month value - checking the OA Flash tab.  I am sure there are some others.  DG 
 Daniel, I show a net open position of (15.9) contracts.  DG    3-9573 
 I relpied to mom already, but thought you would want to see it.  D 
 Sorry.  I just did.  DG 
 We would love to do this.  D 
 I am still trying to recruit.  It seems everyone is out of town that weekend.  When is the deadline?  Let me know.  Oh, I almost forgot, Congratulations!!  DG 
 A W4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on April 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  If you don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and married and jointly.  I hope that made sense.  DG

 Eric, I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal. She ran the transport book at that time.  The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.  I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.  DG    3-9573 
 I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.  We had a great time.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.  It was cold but the game was fun.  It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they did.  We will try and make it a regular trip.  We also spoke about maybe getting together in Dallas sometime next year.  I need to go, but will talk to you later.  D 
 Jennifer, The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further questions.  DG 
 Here is another one.  It will be another Chicago book.  We will never officialize the book.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Susan,  I believe this is all of the Enovate/EMW books that are officialized each night.  IM-EMWNSS1-PRC IM-EMWNSS1-BAS IM-EMWNSS1-IDX IM-EMWNSS1-PHY IM-EMWNSS2-PRC IM-EMWNSS2-BAS IM-EMWNSS2-IDX IM-EMWNSS2-PHY FT-IM-ENOV-PRC FT-IM-ENOV-BAS FT-IM-ENOV-IDX FT-IM-ENOV-GDL FT-IM-ENOV-PHY INTRA-ENOV-PRC INTRA-ENOV-BAS INTRA-ENOV-IDX INTRA-ENOV-PHY TP-EMWNSS-PRC TP-EMWNSS-BAS TP-EMWNSS-IDX  Call me with any questions.  DG    3-9573 
 OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout is as follows:  Group1   Group2 Carole    Jennifer Jason    Anne Chris  Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.  DG 
 Frank, Attached is my PBA nomination for Anne Bike.  Let me know if I left anything out, or need to do anything else.  Thanks, DG 
 Connie,  I believe I misinterpreted your request.  I have updated the list to include every book we officialize each night.  DG    3-9573 
 Connie,  I appologize for the tardiness of this list.  I was out of the office last Thursday and Friday.  Please call if you have any questions.  DG    3-9573 
 Yes  DG 
 It's done.  I appologize for this taking so long.  It won't happen again.  DG    3-9573 
 Don't worry about picking us up at the airport.  I will be careful and brave the elements.  See you tomorrow.  DG 
 Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand if you want to stop the sessions.  Thanks.  DG 
 Will,  Jennifer Bagwell Jason Wolfe Chris Walker Anne Bike Carole Frank  DG 
 I see Jennifer Bagwell in the system, but not Christopher Walker.  DG    3-9573 
 Me and the kids get in at 10am, Kristi has to stay a little later for work and will be in at 3pm.  I was also thinking we could buy tickets at the stadium.  Don't worry about not taking time off.  See you Thursday.  DG 
 One more for you.  Because you're special.  DG 
 Please get this info to me and I will pass it on to AA.  Thanks.  DG 
 Sharon,  We Schedule C'd the $50M difference.  Let me know if you need further info or backup.  Thanks.  DG   3-9573 
 I can't believe it is already time for our trip up to Kansas.  We are arriving on Thursday morning and returning on Sunday morning.  Other than the game on Saturday, we don't have any plans.  See you soon.  DG 
 The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.  Because of work commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.  The 3 of us will get a rental car and make our way to your place.  Are you going to be home then?  Then we will go pick up Kristi later.  We have no plans at the moment (other than going to the game on Saturday).  We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time, though, 6:30am.  They didn't give me many options using reward travel.  We are all looking forward to the trip.  See you on Thursday.  DG 
 Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know?  DG 
 Jeremy, I can calc postids for FT-NW but cannot print.  Please help.  Thanks. DG    3-9573 
 Sharon,  I missplaced the info we were speaking about yesterday.  Please send it to me again so I can follow up.  Thanks.  DG 
 On election day, you have to vote in your own precinct.  You need to find your precinct number and then you can find the location on the web. DG 
 Hector, Kimberly S. Olinger is listed as reporting to me in the PEP system.  She should be moved to Jeff Gossett.  Thanks. DG    Enron North America Corp. 
 The first email was what I sent to Burton and Susan.  This is the confirmation from them that the book was set up.  DG    3-9573 
 Thanks.  You can tell Phillip I'll have it fixed when I return on Monday.  DG 
 We are flying in on Thursday.  We plan on renting a car and driving to your place.  I'll update you on specific times early next week.  Because me and the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on the same flight that the three of us are on.  We are all looking forward to seeing you.  DG 
 Jeremy,  I don't have access to run this book.  Will you please get me authorization? Thanks.  DG 
 Let's make sure we are doing this every night.  I think Jason has been running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last person finished do it every day.  I sure can crank out the emails when I get some uninterrupted time to myself!  DG 
 I am in Chicago today and tomorrow.  I will look at this more while I am here.  DG 
 I can't remember if I forwarded this to you already.  Thanks.  DG 
 Will you two please get this info to Dutch.  Thanks.  DG 
 How was your morning?  I hope not too bad.  I didn't get to sleep until 3am. I miss you and love you.  D 
 11:30am it is  DG 
 Please add Carole Frank to the list.  Her NT username is cfrank2.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 What time are you arriving on Friday?  We got box seats to the Bears game on Sunday.  DG 
 Kathy,  I don't think I will be able to make our meeting tomorrow.  Can we pick it up again next week?  Thanks.  DG 
 I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado, you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country.  And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance. They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team. But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU. They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.  DG 
 Here's what happened. 
 This deal was EOL ID 520766 on the 25th.  Neither the Sitara or EOL number is in Tagg.  Please update the deal with the EOL and Sitara number.  It is very important that you always put this information in Tagg.  In addition, make sure you are updating Sitara with the Tagg numbers as well.  Thanks.  DG 
 Yes  DG 
 I thought you might like this.  Do you have a ticket to Chicago yet?  I don't think Jenny will have any luck getting hired in Risk.  We pretty much rule anyone out without prior experience unless they are internal candidates. However, I have forwarded her resume to Settlements and Volume Management.  I think she should get a call from them.  How's life in Dallas?  Also, what is your new cell number.  The Houston Cellular number no longer works.  DG 
 What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?  Either at night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.  Maybe four times a week.  Running and some weights in the garage.  I would really like to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this. I love you.  D 
 You can start asking me about the West desk.  We don't have any new books for this month.  DG    3-9573 
 This book is for the West desk.  Please call if you have any questions. 
 Mom, Are you leaving on Saturday or Sunday?  I thought yesterday you said Saturday.  I feel much older today. DG 
 I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.  The reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question is 06/00.  When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price. And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct. Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Burton,  INTRA-EMWNSS1 INTRA-EMWNSS2 FT-IM-ENOV INTRA-ENOV TP-EMWNSS  Call if you have any further questions.  DG    3-9573 
 We have some new procedures for changing deals that affect other books. Please read and let me know if you have any further questions.  You don't need to request minibook access individually.  I have, so if needed we can run them on my machine.  Thanks. DG    3-9573 
 Jeremy, I need to have access to calc all books on a minibook level.  Please let me know if you need any further information.  Also, how my proposed index book move coming along?  Thanks. DG    3-9573 
 Done  DG 
 Doug, The Sitara numbers for both of these deals are in the comments section of each deal in Tagg.  Do you have access to Tagg Deal Capture?  The Sitara numbers are 344737 (NS3520) and 344952&343785 (NS4159).  If you don't know where to look for these, let me know.  They were both available in the systems.  DG    3-9573 
 Jeremy, I have added two curves in Publ Names:  WY/WELLHEAD and WY/MKTZONE.  They are in curveview.  Please add them to Tagg.  Call me if you have any questions. Thanks. DG    3-9573 
 Sharon, I have the support you requested.  I am at EB3262B. DG    3-9573 
 Jeremy,  Currently, all of our index deals are in the FT-WEST book.  I would like to move them all to the GD-NEW book.  I don't want to change any price or basis portions of a deal currently in the FT-WEST book, only index.  Please let me know if you can do this.  If you have any further questions, please call. Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Greg, I  have some tickets available for the Missouri game at face value.  Do you want any? DG 
 Put me down as primary with no secondary contact.  Thanks.]  DG    3-9573 
 Jeff, I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is easier said than done. DG 
 I will be there.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 The macro in this file will query all official books for given Portfolio and Book codes.  Use it to make sure all your postid's that need to be, are officialized each night.  Thanks.  DG 
 Gather this info when you get a chance and give it to me.  Thanks.  DG 
 I don't think I am in the market for any stereo equipment.  But I was thinking about trying to sell that land we apparently have through mom.  What do you think?  I will never use it.  Let me know.  DG 
 Try this and see if it does any good.  DG 
 Please make sure we stay off the "list".  Thanks.  DG 
 Mike, We are currently looking into a query which will allow us to see all of our officialized books each night.  It is not ready now, but should be soon. I'll let you know.  DG    3-9573 
 Kevin,  Please remember to link up all deals.  By this, I mean Tagg numbers in Sitara, Sitara numbers in Tagg, Tagg numbers in SCI, and especially EOL numbers in Tagg.  I just got a call about the park & loan on Friday.  You need to put EOL as the system of origin and the EOL number.  Thanks.  DG 
 It should reference the EOL number.  It looks af if Kevin did not link it up.  I'll remind him.  DG 
 Scott,  These places carry the Onkyo receiver.  I don't think they carry Polk, but ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.  The place I got mine from a couple of years ago no longer carries them.  I'm still looking.  Lee's Audio & Video have the Onkyo listed at $629.  Their sight is at leesvideo.com  J&R Music World 800-221-8180 Lee's Audio & Video 425-643-5555 Soundcity  800-370-3156  DG 
 Have you seen this?  It's from Kevin, an Aggie.  D 
 Mike,  The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Eric, Please follow up with Joe about how we arrived at the amounts on the annuities.  Thanks. DG 
 Greg,  Transport Deals/Transport Model OA Relationships between systems (Tagg, Sitara, Portcalc, MetaCalc, Curveview, Excel, Access, Pub Posting, TDS)  These are mostly basic.  DG 
 Are we still on?  Where do you want to go?  I was thinking Mexican, but let me know what you think.  DG    713-853-9573 
 Put the West desk down for 5 people.  DG    3-9573 
 Let me know sometime today if you want to do this.  DG    3-9573 
 The date is good for the West desk.  I will forward a headcount later today.  DG    3-9573 
 Chuck - I am now working on the West desk.  In the future you can send these requests to Scott.  DG 
 Lets do it on Friday  DG 
 Lets try to get together this week if possible.  Kyle wants to go as well. Let me know.  DG 
 Mike,  How goes it?  I was thinking about you guys this weekend.  We were in town for the game (if you want to call it a game).  We ended up staying at a friends place.  I think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't seen you on this particular weekend.  We are still plugging along.  How about you?  I thought I heard you were buying a new house.  Is that right?  Well, I just hadn't talked to you in a while and I saw you email address on a message from Sean.  We are going up to KU for the Texas game again.  I can't believe it has been 4 years since we were up there.  Take care.  DG 
 I'm with you.  I told my wife I thought it would be a 3 touchdown game, but a 49 point margin is unacceptable.  I was at the game and it was as if the Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.  They were out of position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.  I like Brown and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to coach.  I lay this all at his feet.  Obviously the coordinators bear some major responsibility as well.  I really don't know what to expect for the remainder of the season.  They obviously are not as bad as they showed on Saturday.  But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could be humiliated.  I was very wrong.  Something has to change.  The fact is they are 3-5 in the last 8 games.  And were favored in all but one.  Lack of talent is no longer an excuse.  I think the entire remainder of the season hinges on this Saturday.  If they play as poorly as they have all season (they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of the question.  For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game of Brown's tenure at UT.  What do you think? 
 It looks like we need to be consistent in booking the GD spread deals.  Take a look at the example and please remember to book all future deals in a similar manner.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.  DG 
 Regina,  As we discussed yesterday, I need access to West deals in Sitara.  At a mininum I still need access to all Chicago/Midwest deals also.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Jeremy,  I want to move all deals currently in the INTRA-EMWMEH book into the FT-IM-ENOV book.  Attached is a forwards detail by risk of the deals in question.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  I need this done this week if possible.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Catlady, I thought you might like this. DG 
 Richard Tomaski 
 I'm in Chicago right now.  I'll get with you on Monday.  DG    Enron North America Corp. 
 Don't worry about it.  If you can't go, you can't go.  You are not going to pay for the tickets if you don't use them.  Hope you feel better.  DG 
 Unbelievable! 
 I think you forgot to attach the file.  Send it to Kevin.  I spoke with him about your questions.  DG 
 OK, so I really screwed up.  I was getting the tickets out last night so I wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the airport, not the office.  So I'll call you when I get in later this afternoon.  I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that they get lost in the Enron building.  I hope you travel via 290 to Austin because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and you could pick them up on you way out.  I also have a couple of EndZone passes with the tickets.  Sorry for the screw-up.  I'll talk to you this afternoon.  DG 
 Call me if you have any further questions.  DG    3-9573 
 We have the NXAVC settle for Aug at $31.138.  So just pay the lesser of.  DG    3-9573 
 Genaro,  The Sitara was not updated for Aug.  I just corrected Sitara.  So you can redraft in Unify.  I attached the completed calc-sheet.  Sorry for the delay.  DG  3-9573 
 Steve, Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms. I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you get a chance, please give me a call.  Richard wants me to have these deals valued by the end of this month's P&L.  Thanks.  DG 713-853-9573 
 Scott,  Richard Tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the Enovate name while retaining the other books already set up.  This counterparty name Enovate is replacing the Midwest Energy Hub.  But wants to be able to differentiate deals done as solely Enovate with deals done as Enron Midwest. Call me if you have any further questions, or if this presents a problem. Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 The deal number in Sitara was changed because of an internal book name change.  It had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.  If this has caused a problem, let me know.  I didn't think that just changing the deal number would have this effect.   Thanks.  DG    3-9573    Enron Global Finance 
 Regina,  I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is anything else I need to do.  I want to make sure that the books are not only in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.  Thanks so much for your help.  DG    3-9573

 I got this from some hunter friends.  Thought you would like to read it.  DG    3-9573 
 Susan,  Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I need to do.  Thanks for your help.  DG    3-9573 
 Jay,  There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo Alto.  Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.  DG 
 No interns.  As long as my group stays intact I won't need anyone in August. I think Anne will stay past her 1 year and everyone else is relatively new. I do like having analysts though and think we would rather be long than short.  DG  DG 
 Gary,  I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I need to do to help.  Thanks as always.  DG    3-9573 
 Mark,  I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any questions.  DG 713-853-9573 
 Please look over this and get back with me on any changes you would like to make.  I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system:  Enovate LLC.  Under this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg:  FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.  The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.  The FT-ENOVATE book will be a flat book only used for  the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT book to be confirmed).  The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the interest rate group.  This book will be used for EMW related deals not specific to Enovate.  The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the following books in Tagg:  FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra TP.  FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used.  The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.  The other columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected.  I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to set up a new entity as well.  I have run this by accounting and have their approval.  Let me know what you think and we will start the process.  We will have this completed by the end of this month.  Thanks.  DG 713-853-9573 
 Steve, Attached is a list of the Hub Deals we have currently in the system.  I tried to reconcile them to the sheet you sent me but could not.  Please take a look at these and give me a call.  Thanks.  DG 713-853-9573

 You going to the game?  Let me know.  DG 
 I am in the process of getting these deals valued.  I know what we have booked in Tagg as of now, but need to reconcile it to what People's has booked.  I got something from Steve last time I was up, but it does not have deal terms.  Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal? I don't even know his last name.  Thanks.  DG 
 Will you please send Richard Tomaski a version of yesterday's DPR that can be printed or forwarded.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Find anything good?  I love you.  D 
 The deal was entered twice.  I killed 279644.  I spoke with Michael, and he knows the deal has been killed.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 I hope you have a great day.  I love you.  D 
 Did you grant the $750 in orig from the ticket I gave you yesterday?  Let me know.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 Susan,  Do you have a ticket for the above referenced deal?  I am trying to find Sitara numbers, but I don't have a ticket for the deal.  Let me know.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 You should see this from Luchas tonight.  DG    Enron North America Corp. 
 I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.  Sorry.  Like I said yesterday, I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.  I just need to follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also working on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, and liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the Trunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain the deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the meeting today.  DG    3-9573 
 Kristi wanted me to send you a note saying we will be there for the game on Saturday.  See you there.  DG 
 After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of questions.  So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.  I was hoping to get this done today.  But for sure by the end of the week.  I want to ask you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.  See you at 1:00.  DG 
 I'll see you at 1:00  DG 
 Yes.  Just after lunch if possible.  It's bid week.  Thanks.  DG    3-9573 
 It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.  I also don't receive statements in the mail for the account.  It looks as if the automated transactions worked this month.  DG 
 How was class?  I'll see you tonight.  D 
 OK 
 Remember to look at your school schedule so we can book our flights to Kansas.  D 
 How did everything go this AM?  I hope well.  Today is you're first day of class, right?  Have a good day.  I love you.  D 
 Daniel, Laura Luce would like to send the latest Enovate DPR to the chairman of People's Corp.  But the copies we receive have some sort of protection which I'm sure you are aware of.  Will you please send her the latest so that she can forward it to this guy?  Let me know if that is a problem.  Thanks.  DG  I am in Chicago today. 312-541-1198 
 He started to cry last night when you said you were not going to sign him up.  I think we can.  Starting Sep 1, I will not be running a book.  I will be able to leave at a decent hour on scheduled days.  So I will be able to help.  Let me know what you think.  DG 
 I'm in the office.  You need to look a a calendar to see when you can come up here.  Hopefully for a weekend the Cubs are in town.  I love you.  DG 
 Lee, after I put in the deals, the system went down and I was not able to get them to calc.  So they are not in these numbers.  They will be tonight.  See you guys later today.  DG 
 Could you please follow up on this.  Thanks.  DG

 I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.  I held back $1,087,409 from the MEH book.  The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was $20K added to the P&L last Friday.  I did not add that amount back in tonight.  I don't know what it is.  I'll talk to you in the morning.  Let me know if there is something you want me to send you.  Thanks.  DG 
 Well, I hate to write this, but I found out last night that I will have to be in Chicago next Wednesday thru Friday.  Call me.  DG 3-9573 
 Thanks.  I'm obviously not very observant.  DG 
 I didn't get a good response from the one person I know in IT.  So I am sending your resume out for some IT jobs I see posted on our intranet and have asked for help from the HR dept.  I didn't think this would take so long.  I appologize, but I am still trying.  DG 
 I have a friend who is looking to change employers.  He is in the IT field. I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.  Although, he would be interested in any similar job.  I will attach his resume.  What is the best way to get his resume in front of the proper people?  I would appreciate your opinion.  I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron that does.  Thanks in advance for your help.  DG 3-9573 
 Kevin,  I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.  Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for every EOL deal Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, just let me know and I'll follow up.  Thanks.  DG 
 Gary, We need to have two more books created as soon as possible.  These need to be set up the same as the others(not as PA books) Kam requested (moving from and Intra book to an FT book).  FT-INT-CNT-TRANS FT-INT-EMWMEH  Call if you have any questions.  Thanks   DG 3-9573

 Kim,  How are you?  I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it worked.  I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on taking the whole group up for the KU-UT game.  I hope you will be in town as well.  Let me know.  Take care.  DG 
 Uncle Clark,  How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to seeing you all.  DG

 Sean,  How's CO?  I hope you are doing well.  I know I have asked you before, but I seem to have accidentally deleted your dad and sister's email addresses.  I want to ask you dad if he will be in town when KU plays Texas later in November.  I want to bring the whole family.  If you get a chance, shoot me a message with his info.  My mom is vacationing in NY so I can't ask her. Thanks.  DG

 Jay,  I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.  DG 
 I'm in Chicago again.  I return this afternoon.  DG 
 Glad you had a good time.  Next time we will have both SeaDo's working and hopefully the lake will be a little higher.  We have your sandals.  At least I think they are yours.  I am in Chicago right now.  We will try and get them to you soon.  Use dgiron@enron.com for my email address.  DG

 Stephanie,  We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.  Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North  Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this request.  Thanks for your help.  DG    3-9573

 You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good. I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.  You can also just put your own package together.  If you do this make sure the speakers are of the same brand.  This is what I did for Scott.  Many of the speaker packages use  5 small speakers and a sub.  But I suggested larger front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.  Any decent receiver will have a decoder built in.  And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on how much you are willing to spend.  I'll go through my stash of magazines tonight and see what I can find for you to read.  DG
