 hey there: new deals are: -14,784 curveshift was: 51,652  positions and curves are attached.  take care of yourself.  call anytime. 
 hey there,  i will probably not have the aol on in the mornings....too distracting....but i wanted to let you know that i will continue to send you an email everyday after curves until you let me know you have closed all your positions.  give me a ring if you need anything, or shoot me an email.   i'm sure you are also talking to janie. take care, mo. 
 Thanks for the tickets.  We had a great time.  They were actually dead center of the covered area...perfect......and much better than the field considering the lightening storm and heavy downpour that lasted about an hr.   We even got sprayed by some bi-directional rain..it was wild. Anyways, thanks again. Mo. 
 hey there,  i am just anti-msgrs for a while.....just too much chit chat overload for me...not you...just everyone combined....i'm really a loner..ha ha ...anyways.....just letting you know...sure i'll log in later today.....i'll holler if i need to work anything. mo. 
 tuttobene? vincents? w/ grappa bar before? latersky 
 I'm in, and as far as i'm concerned the more laid back of a place the better....i've been to a lot of stuffy restaurants as of late...but seriously i am flexible if we go stuffy.  just let me know when and where. 
 hey there,  this just in....we may all have var limits now....lavo imposed a million dollar fine on our group bc we exceeded var...of course we just exceeded it by 130k....you can imagine our reaction and the discourse....i'll let you know what comes out of that.  so it looks like you did no trades today. your curve shift is -218. mike went out w/ fixed price phys today.  it looks like elpo has picked city gate to manipulate this month....they are lifting the fixed price like it is going out of style.  june basis at the cg ran. the juan cash today was mostly given.....i think matt was able to cover stuff pretty quickly...and with no fluff...ha ha  i guess that is about it.  aga was 118...with 110 being our expectation.  the screen fell a bit as a result  we have prebid today.  hope you feel well.  talk to ya later. attached are just the curves since your positions are unch.  later, Mo 
 I'm glad you remembered my email.  Glad to see you too.  Now that I have your email you are sure to get the invite for next years partyI actually ran into Anthony Magdaleno about 2 weeks ago.  Do you know him?  He was in the same volunteer group w/ Monica and I. I think we are going to meet up at woodrows again this friday.  I like the location....and some different faces as well as opposed to the kirby crowd. I work on the west gas trading desk here at enron....if you have friends who work in gas as well, perhaps i know them.  Of course this place is like A&M....huge.  Take care and hopefully we'll see each other out again. Say hello to Monica for me.  Maybe we can meet up sometime after work for drinks.  Monique 
 hey there, actually i forgot that fri is the first day of bid week which is a basically the 3 busiest business days of the month....when the nymex contract expires for june. anyways, it may be hard for me to commit to a time to get out of here and i think 330 might be early.  i will be in town the entire weekend and i have pretty much nothing on my plate, except make jam.  i know you are probably very busy so is there a better time for you?  we'll figure something out. mo. 
 this just made me laugh 
 Hey there, I don't have David's new email address.  I wanted to see if you all wanted to get together on the house on sunday.  We could grill something outside if you all want.  I'm not sure if David and Terry have other plans.  I would like to bring over a cake.  Let me know what works. 
 This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

 hey there,  here's the stuff: new deals : 2,248 curve shift: 56,497   not much going on...we are all listening to that conference....my ears are hurting ..i think it has given me a headache. i'll talk to you manana. Mo 
 I am determined to get you to smile at least 5 times today....I think I've seen one so far. 
 just curious...are you leaving on friday or sat. 
 I can see this will be difficult.  I will also settle for 5 dirty looks or physical assaults. 
 Melba,  Mike is interested in putting out some of our west eol products on a 24 basis, similar to the nymex desk.  However, we would like more information on how this would work and  what kinds of controls are available for products to shut off automatically.  If you have time today, perhaps you could swing by our desk and give us more information.  Sometime in the afternoon would be great for us. Let me know. Thanks, Monique 
 Hey there,  I have a broker dinner on thurs.  These things can drag out...so I'm not sure I'll be able to stop by. Best of luck in school.  I enjoyed hanging out with you the short time we knew each other.  Forward me your new email address when you get one.  I'll write you if I take the plunge and reverse the long trading/short cooking spread.  Who knows. Take care,  Mo also (moshuffle@hotmail.com)

 I was very worried last night.  David's note made it seem like something had happened.  I didn't know my phone was out.  I hardly use it...i'm really not a phone person.  But when I realized it was out yesterday...cingular was closed and i couldn't call.  John is getting in today.  I am doing a fun run tomorrow morning and we will be in the rest of the weekend.  I should get the phone taken care of later this afternoon.  This evening I have another broker dinner.  I will try to call before I got to that.   Talk to you later. 
 i am not part of the Associate program.  please remove me from future distr= ibutions. 
 yo-  jojo and i are going to do dinner tonight.  i think at around 7...just us.  i'm pretty sure she is going to stay at a hotel.  i will be going home directly after work.  give me a buzz later. 
 Yo! Yes, I believe your typical campells will have little mushroom pieces in it.  And kmart would be a good place to buy a pyrex dish (glass baking)....of course you could borrow any supplies from me any time.  Are you cooking up some grub for a lil lady??? I heard you all had a great time.  Saw the pic of you that john said you "woke up" for at the brewery.  Maybe we all can get together for a brew before john and i are off for alaska on sunday.  we will be gone for a week and a half.  Maybe friday after work. Let me know if you have any other cooking q's. Mo 
 Hey there, Just wanted to let you know that Jojo from nats is having a happy hr tomorrow at State Bar.  It should be a bunch of us west guys and some other hacks from the industry. She was interested in meeting you so we'll see you there if you can make it. Mo.

 I have no idea what my finish time was.  It was somewhere in the 32:00 range....is there a website that I can look this up at? Thanks. 
 Ha.  I will definitely not be on that list.  Lets just say 32:30.  I was just focused on not puking when I crossed the finish so all I could make out was a big 32 on the clock. Thanks. 
 jeese, we don't have to leave this place just bc my trading profits are in a death spiral.  i can always stay here and bake cakes at the omni till you are ready to leave.  and then of course we have to consult the dogs and see what their schedule looks like.  ugh---this day is so bad.  i feel so helpless it just sucks.   i will give you a call when i head out to the hpy hr...did you get my message about AK? talk to you later. M

 Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada Compiled by Outside Online June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports.  Coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old Kyle Harry on Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife. The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the London Free Press.  Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left early on Saturday morning, the London Free Press reports. Harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. They pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. Harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived.  On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack.  On July 2 of last year, 24-year-old Canadian biathlete Mary-Beth Miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Centre near Quebec City.       <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> 
 Hey there,  Mom, can you forward this on to David.  I am going to forward you our flight itenary from home this weekend.  We leave at 9:30am on sunday.  We are going to go into Columbus sat morning and then will stop by David's on Saturday to prep the yard and set up any necessary stuff for the dogs.  We will drop the dogs off though on Sunday morning very early.  I don't want to leave them there overnight for the first night by themselves...though usually they are fine to stay by themselves...I just want to make sure that the yard will be secure.  The company we are going with is called Alaska Discovery.  Their website is www.akdiscovery.com  .  We will be staying at their inn on the days prior and after our actual expedition.  The trip we are doing is called the Glacier Bay Expedition....trip start date being the 11th.  On the 19th we fly back to seattle and will have to stay there overnight.  Our return flight to Houston is wed the 20th at 6ish in the morning and we will both be coming into work when we get in.  We will pick up the dogs that evening.  I am going to leave David my cell phone bc the tags on the dogs have that phone number on it.  To get into the voice mail just dial the phone number  713-516-0651 ....and the password is 1743.  The dogs eat together and share 1 1/2 coffee cans full of dog food once a day.  They eat in the evening.  Pearl takes medication twice a day and one of them is supposed to be taken with food.  We usually just give her a few treats in the am with the pill.  We will leave treats along with the food.  I think that is about it.  Thanks again for taking care of the dogs.  We really appreciate it.  I will call before and after we are in the woods to check up on things and we will pick them up wednesday evening.  Talk to you later.  Mom, John and I will come by before we leave.  Probably Saturday evening. 
 Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.  Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.
