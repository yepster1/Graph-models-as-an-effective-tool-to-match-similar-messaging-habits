 Hey there, Sorry we missed you on Easter.  We had been doing so much driving and still had to go to my moms.  John is actually out of town this weekend.  I will be going to my mom's sat night for dinner.  Maybe there is a time i can meet up w/ you before or after?  Hope all is well. I'll be in town for the next 3 weekends as john will be doing a bit of travel.  Drop me a line if you want to do anything. Talk to ya later, Mo 
 Hey there, No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.  Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend. Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to you soon, Mo.

 Thanks for the tickets.  We had a great time.  They were actually dead center of the covered area...perfect......and much better than the field considering the lightening storm and heavy downpour that lasted about an hr.   We even got sprayed by some bi-directional rain..it was wild. Anyways, thanks again. Mo.
