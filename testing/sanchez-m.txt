 Hey there,  Mom, can you forward this on to David.  I am going to forward you our flight itenary from home this weekend.  We leave at 9:30am on sunday.  We are going to go into Columbus sat morning and then will stop by David's on Saturday to prep the yard and set up any necessary stuff for the dogs.  We will drop the dogs off though on Sunday morning very early.  I don't want to leave them there overnight for the first night by themselves...though usually they are fine to stay by themselves...I just want to make sure that the yard will be secure.  The company we are going with is called Alaska Discovery.  Their website is www.akdiscovery.com  .  We will be staying at their inn on the days prior and after our actual expedition.  The trip we are doing is called the Glacier Bay Expedition....trip start date being the 11th.  On the 19th we fly back to seattle and will have to stay there overnight.  Our return flight to Houston is wed the 20th at 6ish in the morning and we will both be coming into work when we get in.  We will pick up the dogs that evening.  I am going to leave David my cell phone bc the tags on the dogs have that phone number on it.  To get into the voice mail just dial the phone number  713-516-0651 ....and the password is 1743.  The dogs eat together and share 1 1/2 coffee cans full of dog food once a day.  They eat in the evening.  Pearl takes medication twice a day and one of them is supposed to be taken with food.  We usually just give her a few treats in the am with the pill.  We will leave treats along with the food.  I think that is about it.  Thanks again for taking care of the dogs.  We really appreciate it.  I will call before and after we are in the woods to check up on things and we will pick them up wednesday evening.  Talk to you later.  Mom, John and I will come by before we leave.  Probably Saturday evening. 
 Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.  Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.
