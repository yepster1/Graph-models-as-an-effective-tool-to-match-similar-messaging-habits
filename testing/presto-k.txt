contract says.   No one knows what the real intent was. 
 I would not pay alot for this given the transmission issue.   The best place for park and lend is JEA. 
 I would have interest if you package together 50-100 MW of these small units to create a more liquid block of power. 
 Jeff Shorter (your counterpart at TXU) just called me to inform me they will not be trading with Enron until further notice.   They are evalutating their net exposure with us, including London.  His number is 214-875-9632. 
 Just Morgan Stanley requiring tighter credit terms so far. 
 As of 11:15 am, East Power has sold approx. 600-700 gas contracts and bought approx. 3 million Mwh's. 
 We can't make a daily capacity market in the current environment. 
 No need to copy trading.  Thanks. 
 Please proceed with Stacey on taking the prudency you are comfortable with.   Stacey will have to get approval from Louise and/or Lavo.  Thanks. 
 I won't be in until about 9:30 because I have to get my drug  test done. 
 Let's go tonight.  I have a staff mtg. at 4:00 pm and we can go after that.  Does this work for you? 
 Probably Wayne Herndon.   We need to lock him down ASAP.   You and I need to have a beer this week to discuss ENE in general and what you want to do next. 
 Are we making sure everything is done on our end to liquidate and manage the EES retail positions effective 1/1/02. 
 I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.  thanks. 
 I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.  Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right. 
 Do you know this guy? 
 We have some serious issues.   Downgrade, collateral called, liquidity crisis, issue more equity.   I can see $12 pretty easy.  I think both Lay and Fastow are gone. 
 No problem.   The only problem right now is ENE's stock price.   Wow - you get em. 
 Probably Andy Fastow.   His personal hurdle rate is 29% 
 I want to make sure the info is protected and if legal and regulatory are comfortable, then I am. 
 The whole group.    Please type the short agenda I have prepared.  Thanks. 
 I will show him a 50 MW block. 
 The meeting has been moved to tommorow at 11:00 am.   We can discuss these = issues before the meeting. 
 Garret Tripp would be better able to answer your questions for the Canada nuclear facilities.   With respect to forward hedging in the US, we have never seen British Energy hedge anything.   I believe they have transition contracts with the utilities they purchased the plants from. 
 My phone interviews are complete.  Please send someone to pick up my forms. 
 I am interested in firm LD fixed price energy delivered at the Gannon bus-bar.   I have no appetite for unit contingent in the current market.   TECO has an entire system they can lean on.  I would consider bringing the gas, but you would have to involve Scott Neal's desk for transport and valuation becomes complicated.   With respect to volume, I would not want any more than 100 MW.  My strong preference is fixed price energy - no toll.   Volatility is getting smashed and it doesn't make sense to pay for vol in a spread option.  We are a much better bid for 5x16 or 7x24 energy. 
 They have over 2500 MW at Wansley over 2 coal plants and 4 gas turbines (in CC).   They can offer LD at this location 
 I told TJ the phone interview needs to be in the afternoon.   No way will 11:45 work.   We need a  4 or 5:00 pm phone interview, preferably tommorow.  Can you please coordinate with TJ.  58 SOCO trades yesterday.   5 already this morning. 
 Thank you very much for the nice gift (and, of course, the $1).   I appreciate you girls putting up with me and doing a great job for the whole floor.  Thanks again. 
 Ader has managed to get cross-wise with another good employee.  =20  Ader's "supply group" has essentially stolen Roger's approved ERCOT LSE acc= ounts.   Rogers needs these LSE accounts to serve load in ERCOT and now he = has none.   This is BS and should not be tolerated. 
 Looks fine. 
 I received zero. 
 Please arrange a room for an East Power Mtg at 10:00 am this morning.  Agenda:  UBS Warburg Energy Closing/Implementation Organization/Roles On-line products (which products and when) Power documents (EEI and ISDA) 
 PM call with the whole group, including Suarez.   Can you find a date that works for everyone. 
 Can you please set up a meeting and we can discuss. 
 I don't understand this e-mail. 
 Rika and Lloyd.  This is work in progress with a realistic completion date of May 2002. 
 Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio). = AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re= al-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time ener= gy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio= .  Can we use their own testimony against them? 
 We need an immediate legal review to see what are on-going $ risks are in E= RCOT.   The deficiency of $6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of= the QSE's on a pro-rata basis, however what if the deficiency is $100 mill= ion and we our pro-rata share is $3 million?  Do we have any legal recourse?   Do they suspend the deficient QSE immediat= ely? 
 I'll pay the extra $'s.   I would like No. 480 in the new garage. 
 TJ has my calender.   Just about any afternoon will work with this group. 
 We'll go after him. 
 I give bankruptcy 50/50. 
 Can he come over to our trading floor around 11:00 am?   I can give him a quick tour and then give him a macro overview of the NA energy markets.   Please confirm via e-mail and directly with my asst. (TJ Black at 713-853-5800).  Thanks. 
 Resume looks impressive.   We should definitely interview him.   I forwarded e-mail to Louise to see if she knows the guy from her London gas trading days. 
 Do you know this gentleman.   Suarez is high on him. 
 I would support this 100%.   It is consistent with the direction that Whalley, Lavo, and Delainey are headed with the retail risk management group. 
 What other offer? 
 Outstanding.   As usual, you are the king. 
 From East Power's perspective, the East PJM development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of East PJM. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm $2  bid for this spread in Cal 02. 
 Please participate and give group overview.  Thanks. 
 No. 
 Please print and put in binder for me.   Please combine the document from yesterday in the same binder so I can read the whole package while I'm on vacation.  Thanks. 
 He's making his rounds.   I believe he is talking with Corp Risk and Reck.   I get the impression he doen't want to be anywhere near an energy commodity that has a relationship with power (which, of course, is all of them) 
 OK. 
 Florida might be a better location than New Jersey.   Can you say sunshine? 
 What time works for you guys? 
 I need to leave at 3:30 today to go to my stepson's football game.   Unfortunately, I have a 2:00 and 3:00 meeting already.   Is this just a general catch-up discussion? 
 Please follow-up with this gentleman.   Never know. 
 Are all of these units in our database? 
 Notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less.   Additionally, if we use them as sink when we go hourly, they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag.   If these issues are not crystal clear with them, I have no interest in even showing an offer. 
 We don't need gas at this point, but we should be planning to add this. 
 I believe he has signed.   Confirm with Dana Davis. 
 We need the hourly option to allow for non-GTC sources, but we will deliver into-GTC border hourly. 
 Good luck. 
 I would like ASAP (by new building) a huge wall map with the logical RTO boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations (nodes in LMP) and LSE's
