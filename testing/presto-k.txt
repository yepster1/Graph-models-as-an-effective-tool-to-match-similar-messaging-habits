 Please work with Stacey and Donny Vinson to credit New Albany LLC with the 492k. 
 I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.  I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:  1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required) 2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time) 3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm. 4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday 5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)  Let me know if this works for you guys. 
 Carson is done and I just talked with Suarez.   I told John he needs to make his decision based on the economics in his package.   150/150 is a great package for Suarez.   I would be uncomfortable increasing based on other areas where we may be short.    Good news on Craw. 
 Didn't we already hang Richter with this at the Monday mtg.   By the way, Lavo has indicated he will just attend our Monday meetings every couple of weeks instead of having a separate meeting. 
 No, I won't be using. 
 You caught that.  I guess that's fair.   We would likely leave around 1:00 pm CPT which would put us in Portland at 2:30 (West time).  Does this work? 
 We need to send someone.  Thanks. 
 You are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set= up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should= be:  =091) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition= , risk systems, deal capture system, status of =09projects, schedule, etc.) =092) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff, = and gas) =093) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East ta= riffs) =094) Bernie presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal va= luation, new model construction) =095) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio= valuation - works with Richter) =096) You and I find the holes and provide direction.  Your thoughts? =09 
 Sounds OK for now.   Long term, your portfolio manager should know how to value options. 
 The following people will be making the trip:  Portland			Houston Tim Belden			Kevin Presto Mike Swerbzin			Fletch Sturm Bob Badeer			Dana Davis Jeff Richter			Rob Benson Tom Alonzo			Rogers Herndon Matt Motley			Don Black Mark Fisher John Zufferli  Could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and Tim Belden.   We may have to arrange for Don Black and Rogers Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon.   Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let Rogers and Don know.  Thanks. 
 50k.   Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.  We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.  Are you guys in?   We will have a blast. 
 I understand.   If I have too, I will dip into my money.   I think the requests are reasonable and fair with respect to individual's peer group. 
 You will probably be glad you didn't go.   If the boys are in jail in Mexico, you may have to run the desk the next week. 
 Rogers can't attend due to family conflict, therefore, you will be on the corporate jet.   You should be getting a copy of the flight schedule from Kim Hillis via e-mail. 
 Please make sure the meetings I need to attend are on my calender.  thanks. 
 No chance.  He gets nothing other than the pricing model through structuring. 
 Means broken and needs fixed - like your Mercedes. 
 I bet your insurance is a 3 times higher than Calgary. 
 Could I please get an updated valuation summary on the sale of New Albany.   Do not include the $10 million capacity unwind in the economics.  I want only the MTM effects (the accrual benefits are gravy).  Thanks. 
 done. 
 Your welcome. 
 He was under Ed Baughman until approx. 1 month ago.   He is now the Entergy/SOCO scheduler. 
 Below are contacts if you need help over the weekend with new docs, employee questions, etc. Amy Fitzpatrick   Cell:  713-859-6266 Jeanie Sloan   Cell:  713-553-7049  I need to know by noon on Sunday who is in and who is not.   For people not committing, try to get there contracts back so we can re-allocate $'s as necessary.   All contracts signed by Sunday at noon will get a $2500 check from me personally.   I encourage all of you to contribute to the fund to entice early signing.  If you need new docs printed, please contact Amy or Jeanie at above #'s or call me.  Harry - You and your guys situation is different, therefore, ignore the Sunday issue.   However, please contact Amy and/or Jeanie to generate contracts for Steve and Rob (use the $'s we talked about).

 The way you set up the portfolio is very confusing.   Why not have two portfolios:  1) Enron - Restricted (all stock with a $0 basis in this portfolio - should be $400k+) 2) Enron - Options (all ENE stock options - gain/loss column will show intrinsic value)  Thanks. 
 After setting up the portfolio, please customize the view to show the most relevant data.  Thanks. 
 Yes, I think we should make a formal break.   We have separate accountability for retail gen (wholesale plus ancillaries), and I think reg gen plus T&D should have separate accountability as well. 
 We have made great returns on the front of the curve and the back of the curve.   We have significant Cal 02 through Cal 05 positions, that have provided solid profitability.  It is completely inaccurate to say we have made all of our money on the front of the curve. 
 In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.  It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.   Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.  The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.  Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly. 
 I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.   Can you check into this problem.  I want the view for both portfolios to be:		Open Date Quantity Purchase Price Last Price Cost Basis Market Value Gain/Loss Gain/Loss%  Can you make this the default view setting.  thanks. 
 You got it.  I'm learning.   I hope this translates in P instead of L. 
 Thanks. 
 The $5 million is strictly an internal trading #, and is irrelevant from an acct. standpoint.   We can ignore it for the DASH. 
 Do I need to attend.  If so, please put on my calender. 
 Remove. 
 Calender. 
 Approved. 
 You have the latitude to put your key people under contract.   Edith was very clear when I talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers. 
 I concur.   You know we are likely selling New Albany this week and I am assuming ENA's premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset. 
 Your kidding right?   What's the term?   Remember, I only agreed to the terms for 2001 only. 
 With respect to the flight to Ft. Lauderdale on 9/13, can you see if Steve or Continental can improve our row 25 seats to a bulkhead row for both the outgoing and return flights.   Let me know.  Thanks. 
 Agreed. 
 This was not clear and the only thing I agreed to was a premium for 2001. 
 You got it.  I will be in Cabo this weekend with Wolfe's boss (tim belden - my counterpart in the West) and I will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing. 
 EPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP (Installed Capability) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo.   The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation (Paul Posoli and Kevin Presto) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit.  The parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language, at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 I support this.   This wan an oversight on our part. 
 You didn't attach anything. 
 Joe will get promoted at year-end.   Associates are not eligible until 18 months of service.   We placed Joe in Superior. 
 Has East Power recognized the 750k refund? 
 Yes, I am very busy today.   I will get back with you tommorow or Friday. 
 I'm not doing this interview.   I told Dave Duran we have no interest, and I'm not going to waste my time on this individual. 
 Short and sweet.   I like it.   You will have to sell your competitiveness and work ethic, because you bring zero experience and your resume reflects that. 
 I will talk with Belden this weekend and I'll get back with you on next step. 
 Can you show me on an Ameren transmission map exactly where this project is. 
 Greg works for Enron North America Wholesale Services (he is Vice President in West Power over hourly trading, middle marketing, and services business).  You got em.

 Below are the assumptions agreed for booking the New Albany spread option:  EPMI East Power Book pays New Albany a fixed demand charge for the next 5 years as follows:  2001 $4.72/k/mo 2002 $4.63/kw/mo 2003 $4.54/kw/mo 2004 $4.45/kw/mo 2005 $4.36/kw/mo  As consideration for the demand charge, EPMI has the right to "toll" gas through the facility and receive power in return at a fixed heat rate conversion factor of 12.5 MMBtu/Mwh.   In addition EPMI will pay New Albany $1000 per start (for maintenance reserve fund) and $1.00/Mwh for variable operating costs.  The New Albany, LLC will receive an 8% return on capital.   Book value will be depreciated from $409/kW basis on 1/1/2001 to $336/kW on 12/31/2005.  The facility output assumption is 360 MW with a 95% availability in the summer and 75% availability in the winter.  Jenny - Please revise the booking of New Albany in Rogers book effective tonight. 
 Could you please come check Kevin Presto TV....he thinks the cable is out of it. Thanks Tjae 
 You can set up the Tv's now per Fletch thanks again,,,,Tjae 
 Below are the EPMI proposed bid/offer spreads for EES.   These are very aggressive markets given the liquidity issues and regulatory uncertainty that still exist in the Eastern Interconnect.   There are no other counterparties in the market that will consistently make the proposed 2-ways. 
 The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives:  Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on this project. Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.   If Ben elects to continue to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon. Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton restructuring project.   If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself.    The value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team.  Chris - Do you agree with the above description? 
 New Albany will accept proposal assuming my deductible is limited to $1 million per occurence and my BI deductible is limited to 30 days and includes full replacement revenue (less marginal fuel costs) after the 30 day period.
