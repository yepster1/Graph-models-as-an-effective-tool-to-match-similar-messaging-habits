ers know these folks so these questions must be coming from non-commodity people at Williams. 
 My guys are telling me that all of the broker sheets we collected are now in your hands.   The validation for East Power should be very easy because we collected broker quotes almost every day and marked curves nearly every day.   If there are gaps, please let me know.  With respect to vol curves, I am having Wang and Stalford go back and validate. 
 There is one left - Net 10000 DYN short with 10000 DYN long.  Kevin Presto East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.   Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.   With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.  What time period are we validating? 
 Yes, Wang and Stalford picked this back up yesterday. 
 Please coordinate with Kim Melodick to make this happen. 
 Harry is getting with Kim Melodick (HR for wholesale trading) to coordinate the transfer. 
 Doug Gilbert-Smith runs our Texas power group. 
 Yes, I will call you tonight or tomorrow to give you an update. 
 Let's bring him in for an interview. 
 Access approved. 
 Please put on calender 
 Per Lavo, he would like to see ASAP the break-even price on the reg-switch options where length was booked and when wholesale goes below tariff, we can cover and re-create free option.  When can we have summary valuation of this done for East positions? 
 Doesn't it become a free option if you can serve physically or reg-gen via utility tariff.   For example in Illinois and Ohio, wouldn't these markets create free options if the wholesale price goes below reg gen? 
 Are drinks on the house? 
 Based on what Fletch and Doug are doing, I would increase your #'s significantly.   Your liquidity data is very conservative compared to Fletch and Doug.   Your forward volumes are approx. 20% of Doug and Fletch and your ST data is about 50%.  I would complete the form based on the liquidity we saw in Aug and Sept. 
 Before we book the New Albany sale, Lavo would like to have a final meeting with myself, Lavo, Louise, Stuart, and Don to go through final economics and determine appropriate booking.  Stuart & Don - Can you set up meeting? 
 We will pass. 
 thanks. 
 $100k. 
 A former FPL employee (Ken Olan) will be calling you regarding a potential alternative to Orimulsion.   The fuel is sourced from US refinery and can be burned in the same manner as Orimulsion, creating two fuel sources.  Let me know. 
 Agreed. 
 I slept great. 
 Please call me as soon as we find out about the Duke board mtg results.   I need to know ASAP. 
 If I picked 6102, why am I getting 6103? 
 Please put in contact book. 
 Greg,  My brother is looking to make a career change from teaching (currently a biology teacher at Richland High School) into something where performance is rewarded.  He is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive.  Do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys?   I think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry.  I know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the West right now with the California debacle, so I'm not sure if you need people or not.  Let me know if there is any chance for an interview and I can have my brother send a resume.  Hope everything is going well for you and your family.  Thanks. 
 Is the deal done. 
 I received an e-mail from Greg Wolfe.   They do have needs for entry level people.   For whatever reason, he did not receive the attached resume in my previous e-mail.   Please send me a final version of your resume so I can forward to Greg.  thanks. 
 What advantages does this bring for East and/or West Power (other than less mid-yr reviews to do)? 
 Lloyd Will is my fundies interface, and, in general, we have received very good support from Research. 
 Wow - imcompetence at its best. 
 Please give the names of the plants effected ASAP. 
 This list is wrong.   Can you reconcile our headcount by functional group with this "incorrect" headcount. 
 Sounds fine to me. 
 No trading on the 4th 
 Please summarize and hand out to traders.   In addition, create a section on our web site for enviornmental related matters. 
 As you can see, I was copied on the original e-mail. 
 Please handle. 
 My recommendation is that Berney's retail structuring group value the generation deals that are intended to serve retail load. 
 Can you believe Duke paid book value.   Wow!   They even accepted all the risk associated with the Power Systems BS. 
 Cover letter and resume from my brother are attached. 
 I think they are low in FRCC by $1.00-1.50, and I will fix tonight.   The GTC and FL/GA marks are good.   On-Peak in FRCC, however, I will be moving down some, particularly in the shoulder months starting in 03 as alot of combined cycles are added in Florida by both utilities and merchant players. 
 No problem.   $0.50/Mwh is enough for this service.   You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh.   I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh, she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price.  Sound OK? 
 This is all wrong - Amy has latest list. 
 It was actually Stuart Zisman. 
 I can speak with Chris Ahn when he gets back from his honeymoon. 
 Terry,  Please set aside 30 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to Su= zette.   I don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be a= ppreciated.   Please coordinate with TJ Black (3-5800). 
 Isn't this an EOL cost? 
 Thanks for all the hard work and your efforts are greatly appreciated by the power desk.   Is there any chance I can talk you out of your resignation.   I would like you to come work for Lloyd Will and help with our services business and RTO interface initiatives.  We are in the process of completely revamping our systems, and your knowledge would be a huge help in pushing this initiative.   Your thoughts? 
 Yes.   His phone number is 503-464-8481.   I forwarded the resume and cover letter this morning, so I would wait at least one day. 
 Absolutely.   I may have to smooth over the Jim Mehn issue (Chris committed to go to wholesale structuring) 
 Please coordinate with my asst. (TJ Black @3-5800) to set up an afternoon meeting next week. 
 Duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption.   They have indicated that creates "accounting issues" for there accrual book.  Therefore, I need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows.  In rough numbers, we receive $200 million in the first two years and return $250 million in the last two years.  Because of this, in years 03 and 04, our collateral posting will be significant.  Let me know your thoughts ASAP on Monday morning. 
 Still no fix.  Kevin Presto East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Who is Guy?   I agree Rogers, however, you need to help me finesse the situation.   The "just say no" approach will go nowhere with Delainey.   Let's talk about a workable approach.   Hang in there. 
 Can we make sure this goes on the Web site. 
 Thanks Joe.   I will have Tom and/or John follow up with Rob. 
 Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 We can honor the original ticket grants. 
 Please get a $ amount from Deffner's group on the collateral cost issue.  Given the shape of the loan, Enron will have to post significant collateral on the 03 & 04 positions, and I need a PV cost associated with collateral requirements of this loan package.  Please talk with Bradford with respect to credit $'s. 
 Rika,  Please assign an analyst to show all generation in the Com-Ed control area.   The primary owners are:  1)  Edison International (former Com-Ed coal plants) 2) Com-Ed (nuclear and some GT's) 3) People's (Elwood and one other merchant plant) 4) 5-6 miscellanious merchant plants (includes Allegheny's Lincoln Center facility) 
 Thanks and good luck. 
 Who called it a new business? 
 I agree with Rogers.   Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market, it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs.   At that point, both entities will assume separate responsibility. 
 Did you use Florida curves from Friday?   The curves are much lower Friday vs. Thursday. 
 Agreed.   Actually, I think you are being too aggressive. 
 I need the reg gen postion, transmission position, distribution position, and ancillary position.   If you have to bundle the T&D and ancillary into one position, that is fine.   However, I want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the MWh position.  Thanks. 
 Based on the # of EES people attending a meeting that is about tariff prices (ie. EWS , I would hate to see the expense side of the EES ledger. 
 Ridiculous.   I have been forwarding all of your e-mails today to Lavo and Louise.   I am trying to build a case to get Ader and Bernstien (Bert and Ernie are my new nicknames) re-assigned and away from our supply business. 
 Sounds good. 
 Looks good. 
 Thanks. 
 Good info.  Thanks. 
 No more e-mails.   I still don't have the forward FPC tariff curve.  How is this so complicated. 
 Good info.   Thanks. 
 When is the MISO set to go commercial? 
 What are the biggest needs in fundies right now?  I would like a fundies rotation, risk books,  and real-time.   Risk books or fundies should be the 1st rotation and real-time should be the last. 
 Wes Colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization.   My understanding is that Delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year.   Please confirm with Wes. 
 Calender. 
 You are still missing a significant grant of restricted stock in 2000 and 2001.   Can you please include these grants in the portfolio manager.   I have requested this several times now.  thanks. 
 No problem. 
 Lloyd and I will be assembling a team soon.   All discussion should go through Lloyd. 
 Please remind me to file expense report from CT trip.   In addition, please block my calender from Feb 6th to 10th for Florida (Miami) vacation.   Please also change the March vacation to March 9-13 (Disneyworld).  Kevin Presto East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Yes. 
 I am still not pleased with the information display on the cubes.  It is way too difficult to view daily information and move from month to month to observe historical heat rate liquidations and $/Mwh price liquidations.   The tables on the top need to have dates and summary info.  Please assemble a project team to make the data more user friendly.  thanks. 
 We should value the project.   A combined cycle in Eastern NY may make sense. 
 Stuart Zisman will be your contact. 
 Yes, that's correct.   Sorry, but with Matthew coming back that same weekend, it just isn't going to work.  Have fun. 
 I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling.   It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region.   Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation.  Maps and graphs are very useful.   The presentation should be very macro in scope.  I would work with Gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar. 
 The date works fine. 
 For the 25th presentation, I need the following:  A pictorial description of power generation sources:	1) Nuclear 2) Coal 3) Resid Steam Unit 3) Gas Combined Cycle 4) Gas Simple Cycle 5) Hydro  I would like to show annual demand by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) for the East, West, and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas.   A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful.   In addition, total capability by supply source  Some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton. 
 As I discussed with Joe Deffner, the Duke transaction we recently completed (loan in a commodity deal), we were unable to get the "exception language" for collateral.   We did the transaction at LIBOR - 10bp and even when we add 65-75 bp for the cost of an LC, the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash.  The confirms we sent incorrectly placed the "exception language" and I am correcting that today. 
 Yes - coordinate time with TJ Black. 
 I would like to discuss SE desk head opportunity with you.  I have spoken with Jim and he has given me clearance to talk with you.   I would like to meet this afternoon if possible. 
 Sounds good.   I'll see ya at 4:30. 
 I would like to discuss a term trading job in East Power.  I have talked with Fallon he is OK with me talking to you.   Do you have time to meet later today (5:30 pm) or tommorow. 
 What do you expect.   Enron is one of the top 25 companies in the world. 
 I am not interested.   Dave Duran may have interest and I will forward this e-mail to him. 
 On the new phone card (some later date), please include Rogers Herndon, Jeff Richter, Tim Belden and Anthony Dayou under retail risk management (new category on the card).  Thanks. 
 Please drop by to give me an update.   Remember we need positions broken down by component (retail gen, reg gen, ancillaries, tariff, etc.) and positions by customer.   We also need P&L by component and by customer.  Thanks. 
 I am not aware of the is RFP at all.   Our orig group provides zero info.   I will forward to Ed Baughman. 
 Who is working on this? 
 Calender. 
 FYI. 
 I used to get an e-mail every day with the component var.   I would like to start receiving this again. 
 I would like hard copy executive summaries of all of the RTO orders 
 I do not agree with this approach.   We are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade.  I strongly object to your recommended approach. 
 The curve sheet is fine, but I totally diagree with the morning report and demand forecast.   I would not give these to the risk group. 
 Let's discuss this in our Monday meeting.   In general, though, your approa= ch seems reasonable to me. 
 I'm good for $50.   You can collect next time you are in Houston. 
 I like your approach.   Would the Norfolk location fill the UI short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit? 
 Your welcome.  My wife's uncle died of Luekemia approx 2 months ago. 
 How are we precluded from extending our current contract.   I never agreed to that.  That's BS. 
 Through separate desktop. 
 No problem.   I need to know by mid-week, if possible.  Thanks. 
 Fine. 
 None that I am aware of.   We need to take positions that support our long term view of competitive energy markets for all consumers. 
 You need to go through Don Black and Anthony Dayou. 
 4:30 is good.   Should I expect good news? 
 I'm meeting with Suarez at 4:30.   I can meet with you at around 5:00.  Sound OK. 
 Thanks for the update.   You are doing a great job and I appreciate you all your hard work.   I don't have to worry about any of the administrative issues, and that makes my job much easier.  Have fun on the trips and make sure you and Amy get well.  Thanks again. 
 Right now, all of our trades are fixed price at a specific hub.   We will be moving to basis markets in some locations in the very near future. 
 No problem.   He can expense it. 
 I need 2 additional tickets for the Washington game that are next to my 4 season tickets.   I will call you later today to give you my AMEX to get the parking pass and confirm the specific seat location.   Patrick never called me to confirm the seats in the front row of the upper section, therefore, your message is the first confirmation I have received.  Thanks. 
 Your thoughts? 
 I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.  Other input? 
 Please put the Kinch Kato e-mail address in my address book.  Thanks 
 I agree with Dick. 
 Please review resume.   She comes highly recommended by Paul Racicot.   She is part of the EBS redeployment. 
 The pricing information on the website is fine. 
 No cash, but yes to the confidentiality agreement. 
 Does 5:00 work? 
 Please put on my calender. 
 Can you please add Rogers to the interview list.   I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk.  Given that Jay Lewis has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under Dave & Janet, we very much need a solid sr. person to run this group.   I understand the West is trying to get one of Jay's people to come to Portland.   Is Dale a candidate to run both groups?  If Jay leaves, we are big time short. 
 Agreed. 
 Louise indicated that credit has agreed to allow credit-worthy counterparties to trade through 2004.   The following are the counterparties East Power would like to have 04 access on EOL.  Dynegy Duke BP Energy Aquilla Morgan Stanley El Paso Williams Reliant AEP Constellation Calpine Merrill Lynch Allegheny Conectiv Mirant  Please let me know ASAP who gets approved and when EOL will grant trading rights.  Thanks. 
 OK - Doug can have Smith Day and Jeff Miller work to get the retail certification. 
 That is very possible because Calpine was selling 02 and 03 natty early yesterday. 
 Can you make sure and attend.  Thanks. 
 I have been assuming around 10k.   Talk to you later. 
 Stuart Zisman can answer this question. 
 Congrats. 
 Please approve access. 
 They have agreed to grant us access.   I granted access to power curves based on the understanding they would grant full access to all coal curves. 
 Per Gary Hickerson & Kevin McGowan, EGM agreed to make all coal curves (including PRB) available to power desk if we provided the power curves to the equity group.   Therefore, please ensure we receive this info in a timely manner.  Thanks. 
 I want our VAR to be accurate on all accounts and I will settle for nothing less. 
 Please send me the CD.  Thanks. 
 Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.  Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).  Thanks. 
 What is this? 
 I need until Friday to get this done.   This has been the busiest trading week of the year.  Thanks. 
 I will have TJ set up and Lloyd attend.  thanks. 
 Please place on calender. 
 Calender. 
 Yes I would like to attend meeting regarding NRG deal and let's have a position meeting this afternoon at 4:00.   Does that work?   I will keep my ears open for Zone J and G markets.   PJM East markets are rarely shown except for summer spreads which are now $18-25/Mwh (approx.) for 02 and 03. 
 I have a fundies mtg. with Skilling at 3:00 and I should be done by 4:00.   Let's plan on 4:00 for NRG in my office and positions meeting after at whatever location works for you. 
 Sounds good.  If you need anything from me, let me know. 
 Who does Janel work for now? 
 We need it w/in the first 30 days. 
 That's fine. 
 Yes we need PRB 8400 and PRB 8800 curves.   My agreement with EGM was coal curves in exchange for power curves.  Heather - If I don't get the PRB coal curves by the end of this week, I will have to remove access to our power curves. 
 Please print the agenda for myself and fax copy to Evelyn.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the note and good luck. 
 I was told 2:00 pm. 
 Th
