n order to prevent arb opportunities from the market.  any ideas on that? 
 david - where are we on this?  is there any hope of getting this done? 
 why dont i try kim or marta first? 
 i would like to bid 5 points on jay fiedler 
 i also would bid 5 points for charlie batch if i dont get fiedler -- i also want to bid 25 points for jason brookins 
 hey there -- we are doing really well - i cannot believe that she's almost 5 months old.  anything new with you guys?  hope all is well.  pat's email is pkuykendall@wm.com  and his phone number is 713-265-1216.  maybe you guys can come out and visit sometime soon. 
 hey - seems like we arent the only ones that think kyle is an arrogant asshole anymore - susan told me that on saturday night she had it out with him and doesnt want him around -- also, apparently he's been treating dana like shit and it's starting to get noticed by other people -- just thought this was an interesting development. 
 i talked to chris a little bit and he is going to call back tonight at 6 at home. 
 hey martin -- i sent you an add/drop request -- i am bidding zero points obviously 
 how's this for the daily update:    "Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur"   hmmmmmmmmmm......... 
 wow - i wonder.... 
  tell me what you think - or any ideas to add - the changes were done by pat - i havent read it yet as it would be odd to pull it up here so i dont know if i agree with them or not 
 i am hearing from the youngsters that bullets are the way to go -- also, i'm out of ene in the schwab - oh well - another $300 down the drain - my fault this time 
 Hi Chris -- wanted to make a couple more changes on the resume after having someone review it -- will forward this evening.  Thanks again. 
 just saw on cnbc -- enron talking deal with dynegy 
 this is so ironic 
 they halted trading on the stock - we are restating all financial statement since 1997 - i couldnt sell in time - i hope you  talked to rick - i couldnt get ahold of you -- this sucks really bad 
 agreed 
 i should be there -- i think -- mi luni is fine 
 i can't go on wednesday -- i have a dinner interview -- it was the only time the guy could do it.  sorry. 
 thank my buddy rachel for all these things.... 
 ok - so we all owe $45 -- somebody can just give me $20 and then everyone else can pay dana.  I'm not in a hurry so no biggie. 
 I'm jealous - i can't go wednesday!   have an interview and that was the only time they could do it. 
 well - it's okay -- alot of people here are really confident about going head to head with dynegy traders and kicking their asses -- and i've had a pretty good year so i'm not that worried -- but - that said -- i do have a couple things lined up just to see if there's something better -- what about you?  did you get your interview at pan can yet?? 
 i'm doing great -- the baby is so much fun but alot of work -- i feel tired 90% of the time -- enron is actually okay -- i feel good about my chances to stay on with the "new empire" -- but, i'm still taking this as an opportunity to explore some other options to see if there may be something incredible out there that i am missing out on.  what's new with you??

 advice -- any trips you want to take - do it now - start saving a bunch of money - and just remember -- when you start trying - it could happen on the first try!!!

 hey ken -- looking forward to meeting with randy tonight (he probably told you already) -- i know he's talked to some other people that he hasn't been too impressed with -- do you know if there is anything special that he's looking for -- or i should say -- anything that specifically rubs him the wrong way -- my only bonding experience with him has been making fun of janie at parties!! 
 I'M IN -- assuming we leave at 3 which i think is the case 
 hey - thanks for getting back anyway -- i thought it went pretty well - he said -- let's keep talking -- kevin masek was there too - i stayed for a drink with him after randy left and he thought it went really well.  i had a good time -- seemed like he was trying to be pretty formal though.  i was pretty excited with what he had to say about their plans and i know i would get along well with the people that are there so far.  and, i think i can bring alot to the table for him.  we'll see what happens.  i know he'll tell you everything :). 
 any new progress on this?? 
 can i write you a check for this?  and, by the way, have people been paying you, because alot of people dont read their email 
 this is the rebuild of all the gas daily and index spreads including the addition of aeco spreads along with a few others 
 I just wanted to send a follow-up thank you for dinner the other night.  It was nice to see you again and to hear about the exciting prospects you have at RWE.  I know I would enjoy being a part of your trading team, and I truly believe that I can provide you with a good base a knowledge and a strong desire to continue to grow as a trader within your organization. 
 I heard a rumor that you guys may be hiring -- is this true, and, if so -- for what? 
 i have dinner at my parents' tonight -- meeting my brother's girlfriend!!  have fun though. 
 =20 
 susan was already paying me -- i think there may be some confusion - i'll let you guys work it out -- thanks! 
 sounds great - we will definitely try to see you that weekend -- cinco ranch is actually public so that shouldnt be a problem -- willow fork is private but i think you can rent it and just pay more -- i went to a reception at the equestrian center once and that was really nice -- i know whatever you choose will be beautiful -- take care -- see you soon. 
 CONGRATULATIONS!!!!    I'm all teary eyed!  I knew you picked a good one!! 
 susan_m_scott@hotmail.com 
 I need trade access to the western canada gas products on eol.  Thanks. 
 i guess i need access to view the site with the p/l, that is, if i am supposed to have it. 
 i did that the first time -- it takes me to a page that says i do not have permission to view that sight -- and it directs me to send you an email 
 i cant remember who you forwarded this request to -- she said it was done but i still cannot see the products.  my eol id is ADM53618 -- maybe it was updated on the wrong one. 
 login  tkuyken   pword  tkuyken1 
 let me talk to wes and find out really where this stuff is  -- it may be closer to ngpl perm -- i have no idea until i see the physical location 
 should we be invested in oil producers instead of enron and calpine??????????????????? 
 thought you might like to see a pic of the little one. 
 glad you made it safely!  enjoy the snow!  my home email is patrick_kuykendall@hotmail.com.  talk to you soon -- take care 
 i heard this yesterday!  perfect example of the state of our economy! 
 i'm at a loss on calpine also -- seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building -- seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line -- i dont know - just a thought -- the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me. 
 can you give me the address for the kids center so i can complete the nomination form -- also do we put knowledge beginnings or lorraine as the center director? 
 Hi Lorraine.  I was trying to complete the form to nominate the Kid's Center for this award and I need the phone number and fax number there.  I'm not sure why I don't have them, but I don't.  Thanks for your help. 
 Hey Fritz.  I am going to send you an email that attaches a referral form to your job postings.  In addition, I will also personally tell the hiring manager that I have done this and I can also give him an extra copy of youe resume.  Hopefully we can get something going here.... 
 I would like to bid 20 points on Chris Weinke and if I dont get him - i would like to bid 5 points on jay fiedler 
 This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks. 
 phone number -  713-937-4575 
  I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with? I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks. 
 I also talked to the manager of the East region scheduling group and he said he would have HR call you for a screening interview, so be ready.  Call me anytime after about 11. 
 lots of good news out about duke energy -- low p/e -- take a look 
 Hey Cathy -- just checking in with you.  It was good to see y'all again, but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in October.  I wanted to see what your Sundays looked like - we are out on the 19-21 but that's all.  Also, do you have contact info for Tom and Nicole?  I'd love to get in touch with both of them.

 Hey Tom and Nicole --  I wanted to get in touch with both of you -- I FINALLY got your email addresses.  My little girl - Erin - is almost 4 months old now - and is and absolute joy.  She's a pro a rolling over and grabbing and chewing on everything she can get her hands on.  I wish you guys could see her.  I'm attaching a picture even though it's a little old.   After you see this  - I won't have to tell you how much she looks like her daddy.  Life has definitely changed, but for the better.  Believe it or not, I haven't gotten drunk in over a year and have no desire to do so - HA!!  I'm still working at Enron, trading away -- it's still been the best move I ever made.  Pat is now at Waste Management after getting laid off from the little .com company.  Again, a very good turn of events.  We are loving Katy, especially with the swimming pool built in the back yard and some really great neighbors.  Enough about me -- please write back with updates - I feel like I've totally lost touch and I don't want to keep it that way.   Take Care and talk to you soon,  Tori 
 Hi Steve -- I just wanted to let you know to change your distribution list for this email -- you can take me and Jan off and add Patti Sullivan -- patti.sullivan@enron.com and Ted Evans -- ted.evans@enron.com.    Thanks. 
 that date works for me as of now -- and i do have a few things 
 i will be attending the party 
 Have fun in Port A -- i'll tentatively pencil in the 28th - let me know if something comes up and i will do the same 
 the seats are in the lowest section - within one of the baselines -i cant really remember what row - they are pretty good though 
 sounds like a good plan -- i guess the best thing to do is follow advice of the experts -- hopefully we will win in the long run 
 ok - great - sounds good - let me know if you need any more information 
 hello - i left you a message on your cell phone a month ago - I thought you decided that you didnt want to talk to me or something.  CALL ME -- 713-853-3275. 
 Hey there.  All is well with Erin and with me.  Although I can tell you that I definitely have not had time to pick up a book lately.  Our day consists of -- wake up at 5, feed Erin, get ready, drive to work, work, drive home, feed the baby, eat dinner, play with the baby, bathe the baby, go to sleep -- and I'm really lucky if I'm not awakened at 2 or 3 am.  But, it's ALL worth it.  I would be glad to give you a recommendation -- any idea where you want to be?  There are a few people hiring right now for sure. 
 hey- got your voicemail - i'll definitely try to meet up with you when you are in town.  i already have a ton of plans in the next couple of weeks so i'm not sure how many more nights i can stay here late.  what time are you leaving on the 17th? 
 well - the problem is that I have 2 dinners next week and one om the 17th - it's tough to leave pat at home with the baby that many nights -- but we'll see 
 Mike - I need to go to the doctor tomorrow - the only appt I could get was 12 noon and it's in Katy, but I will get back as soon as I can.  I have been having some issues over the past week or so and I really need to get it checked out. 
 I would like to bid 10 points for wade richey in this weeks free agency draft 
 celestine -- i have not been a member now for over a year -- can you take me off your mailing list?  thanks. 
 well - the gentleman's package seems a little excessive since it has a manicure and a haircut thrown in.  It looks like if we do the massage and facial only - it would be about $150 total.  The phone number is 713-685-6718. 
 i dont know him but he's legit - just looked him up.  what job are they calling about? 
 i hope not - but you never know with those HR guys.  anyway -- if you get some more details -- i'll fill you in on any info i have 
 the plan sounds good to me - i think signs are usually enough -- just put a few out at all the possible routes 
 works here 
 that works for me 
 i guess we know why it tanked now -- i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions - at this point - i would believe anything - this sucks -- we have an employee meeting tomorrow - everyone is waiting to here what lay has to say 
 the 14th is much better for me as we already have plans on the 7th 
 I don't think you would really want to be here right now anyway.  Not the best environment - besides - you hate Houston, right?  Have you gotten any other leads? 
 sounds like you have some good prospects - if you can land something decent in this economy then i think you're doin okay.  good luck - keep me updated. 
 okay - so here's the deal - ugh - i hate to say this but we may have to postpone again.  pat's parents were supposed to come last weekend and they didnt because pat's dad was sick, so they are thinking of coming this weekend instead.  they usually leave pretty early on sunday, but with your time constraints with the foleys thing - i dont know if we'll be able to squeeze it in the middle.  i'll let you know if anything changes - if not, it may be back to the drawing board.  i saw terra, di ,and nicole this weekend in austin - it was great to hang out with nicole if only for a little bit.  how's john's job search going?  it's pretty rough out there - i've been thinking about you guys alot, hoping he can get something soon.  anyway - i'll let you go -- take care. 
 i think it's going to be virtually impossible for me to skip out early on afternoon meetings for a while.  So, i may end up having to be here til 5 on days that we have the bigger  ones.  this sucks but i think i just have to out up with it for a while.  you okay with this? 
 insiders starting to buy here 
 ok - so it looks like pats mom has to work on sunday so i guess it's back on - we should be able to get there at about 12:30.  what do you want me to bring? 
 Okay, here's what you're supposed to do... and try not to be LAME and spoil the fun. Just give in. Copy (not forward) this entire e-mail and paste it onto a new e-mail that you will send. Change all of the answers so that they apply to you. Then, send this to a bunch of people you know *INCLUDING* the person who sent it to you. The theory is that you will learn a lot of    little known facts about your friends. It is fun and easy.  **Remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you.**  1.
