 We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as possible.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for having the league.  I'd definitely do it again next year.  Here's my address -        4419 Stackstone Ln. Katy, TX  77450 
 the price on the deal was 10.30 
 Here you go!  Happy New Year! 
 the current bid for jan-june for the west texas pool gas would be HSC-.06. this bid should be right on the market according to what i have found. please feel free to check around if you'd like, but i will need an answer today if you want be to start pulling gas on the 4th.  thanks. 
 I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.  As for me, I got married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at UT.  We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.  Anyway, we'll be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.  I spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am doing something completely different that I absolutely love.  I work for Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.  I'm trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and challenging.  My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.  We bought a house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved into a new house that we built in Katy.  We wanted to be close to my parents and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live there.  Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.  Oh yeah - and my address is: 4419 Stackstone Ln. Katy, TX 77450 I hope we can keep in touch.  I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.  Give me some more details in the next email! Take Care and Happy Holidays!   Love, Tori 
 I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori (Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop me an email - let's catch up. 
 can you also add :National Fuel Marketing Company.  thanks. 
 hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe $145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for making the semi-finals?
