 Are you married yet? 
 Amy, Thank you for my birthday card.  I really appreciate it.  I'm sorry, but I've been meaning to call you.  I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.  Clint 
 Jennifer, I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't get to meet up the second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out again on Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I missed you.  Talk to you soon.  Clint

 I promised I looked for you that night.  Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper?  Last of four nights, huh?  I remember those days about 3 years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day weekend, and are back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for the band I was playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in
