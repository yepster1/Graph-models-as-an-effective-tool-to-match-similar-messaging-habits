 Thank you very much for your help. 
 Yes, yes.  Sorry for not replying.  I'm good for two. 
 The "silent one" speaks. 
 Wow, I almost forgot.  Thank you.  I will contact her soon. 
 Amy,  Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you think, and we can go from there.  Clint
