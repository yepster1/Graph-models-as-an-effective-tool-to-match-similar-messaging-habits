ld not be happening.  I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down.  Jay

 He works or worked here and he wanted my email address at home.  I think we should kill the deal on the firelogs.  Just too much unknown right now.  Tell her the truth about Enron and my employment situation and find out what we need to do to stop the deal (in writing and by when?)

 Hi...here is a test message for you.  me 
 Here they are.  Let me know what I did wrong please.  Thanks,  Jay 
 I can get to the CIG web homepage but I cannot get into Cutomer Activites, Citrix, or Informational Postings.  It is critical for nominations and information purposes that I can get into these areas this morning.  Please advise as to how to access these portions of the website.  It seems like there are changes in the URL address and maybe that is the problem.  Thank you,  Jay Reitmeyer Enron 
 Have a good safe trip going to Conroe.  We are still planning on next Friday but don't know what time yet.  Y'all be careful.  Love,  Jay 
 11:00pm CDT...  Nymex = 2.80 = sprayed Kern/Opal BOM = 2.42 = sprayed  Basis = tighter = sprayed  ENE = 20.9 = sprayed  Have a nice day. 
 I will try to be there.  Jay 
 That looks pretty good.  It looks like there are a few outliers on the graphs, but overall it looks really good.  Go ahead and do whatever else you think you should do.  This load should be very temperature sensitive and there should be no linepack or anything else in this load information.  Thanks,  Jay 
 That looks good Torrey.  When will it be placed in production?  Thanks,  Jay 
 great job...i am impressed. 
 I would guess that Paul will lose his job within the next few weeks...but that should not leave the walls of your house.  I think I am ok if I want to stay.  It is really a scary situation and this is what I get for corporate lifestyle I guess.  We probably won't know the full effects for several more months, but I think that a lot of people will get laid off before Christmas.  Gald to hear that Mom and Dad made it ok.  Hope y'all are having fun together.  How are you feeling?  I have not talked to you since your wonderful phone call.  I heard you were going through some pretty bad morning sickness but that things were better now.  I am praying that from here on out you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Really try to enjoy it.  Let me know how you are doing and what you need or need for the baby.  However, I am not available to go pick up ice cream and a pickle at 2am, that is W.R.'s job.  I have already done that.  Take care and I will try to keep you posted.  Love, Jay 
 Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see it coming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.  Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.  Jay 
 You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids and how much you hated "big kid" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you want for them.  Love, Jay

 Good question.  I would like the 2 games but this is not about me.  Jr. Monopoly may be a little too much for her still.  She would probably enjoy the Dr. Barbie or the computer game the most.  But she will want to play the game on the computer right then so Mom better be prepared for that.  Hope y'all are having fun.  Love,  Jay
