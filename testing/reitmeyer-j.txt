here on out you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Really try to enjoy it.  Let me know how you are doing and what you need or need for the baby.  However, I am not available to go pick up ice cream and a pickle at 2am, that is W.R.'s job.  I have already done that.  Take care and I will try to keep you posted.  Love, Jay 
 Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see it coming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.  Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.  Jay 
 You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids and how much you hated "big kid" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you want for them.  Love, Jay

 Good question.  I would like the 2 games but this is not about me.  Jr. Monopoly may be a little too much for her still.  She would probably enjoy the Dr. Barbie or the computer game the most.  But she will want to play the game on the computer right then so Mom better be prepared for that.  Hope y'all are having fun.  Love,  Jay
