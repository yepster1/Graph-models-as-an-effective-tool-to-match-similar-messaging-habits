 Mr. Ross, The alternate Letter of Credit format is acceptable and we will make this change.  I have asked Nidia Mendoza in our Credit dept. to respond to you regarding the collateral rounding amount you mentioned below.

 Wendy, I think the amendment only brought the collateral threshold to zero for trades after Dec. 31, 2001.  There was no mention in the amendment of the new ENMAX entity.  We sent a draft ISDA for ENMAX Energy Marketing, Inc. but have not heard anything from them.
