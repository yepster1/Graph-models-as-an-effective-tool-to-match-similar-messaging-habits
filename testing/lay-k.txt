Our broadband business is doing great.  Just a few days ago, we announced a video-on-demand service we will be providing with Blockbuster.  It has created a lot of interest.  In general, my family is doing very well.  Linda and I now have six grandkids (four new ones since the first of the year) plus Elizabeth's wedding.  Let's stay in touch.  Ken" 
 Hi Jaime -  Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the dinner for a briefing.  Thanks.  Rosie 
 Mr. Christman:  Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in France, the format looks wonderful.  Unfortunately, Dr. Lay has calendar conflicts and will be unable to participate.  If you should need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.  Tori Wells Executive Assistant 
 Oh, Rob, I'm happy to do so!!  I hope you are on vacation!!  Rosie 
 Hi Rob -  Ken said "If you'll prepare the remarks, I'll be happy to do this".  Rosie    Rob Bradley 07/19/2000 09:51 AM 
 Letter dictated by Ken Lay  Gene:  I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.  Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any further help, please let me know.  Ken 
 Dictated letter from Ken Lay  Dear John:  I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.  I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a summer conference.  The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully considered.  I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too distant future.  Warm regards,  Ken 
 Ken said "John, this looks fine to me.  Why not send it to George for his consideration".  Rosalee for Ken Lay 
 Hi Mr. Grady -  I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, and he said that is great for you to attend.

 Yes, Dennis, we got it by e-mail and fax.  Thanks.

 Hi Deborah -  Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?  Thanks.  Rosalee
