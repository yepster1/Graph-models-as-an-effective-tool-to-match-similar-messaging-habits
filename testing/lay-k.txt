 Sharon:  Mr. Lay's e-mail address is kenneth.lay@enron.com  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thank you 
 Dick, I don't know if we answered this for you or not, but I'm sure it will be fine for you to draft a letter for Ken's signature.  Rosie 
 Jeff, I will definitely show this to Mr. Lay.  However, I had a thought.  Why don't you draft what you'd like him to say and then he can make changes to it as he wishes.  That would really be helpful.  Thanks.  Rosalee

 Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -  We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only window he has next week.  Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.  Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a press release, he said that is fine.  Rosalee 
 You are all the most thoughtful and sweet!!!  Thank you so much for the flowers that you sent today!!  You made our day wonderful!!  Thanks so much!!!  Rosie 
 Hi Liz -  Your Father wrote:  "Elizabeth -  The Republican Convention is July 31 - August 3.  Although there are no guarantees I expect I can get you tickets and reservations.  Love,  Dad"  Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad will have, so hopefully that will work.  Rosie 
 Hi Corey -  My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for thinking I know anything about baseball.  Look forward to hearing from you!!  Love,  Aunt Rosie 
 Yes, indeed. 
 Gary, I could open it perfectly!! 
 Hi Terry -  Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the "Digital Divide" and TFA.  He is attending the Fortune Battle Royal and said this fits right in with the subject.  He will be leaving for Washington tomorrow night.  Thanks.  Rosalee 
 Ken Lay has approved the attached expense report for Rosalee Fleming.
