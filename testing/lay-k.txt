Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  We look forward to hearing from you.  Rosalee 
 Hi Barbara -  does Ken Lay need to be on these e-mails?  Rosie 
 Good morning, Michelle -  Ken Lay said that he would be happy to be the opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25, 2001.  Sorry for the delay, but at least we are sure he wants to do it.  Rosalee 
 Dear Nicolas:  I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.  My wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.  With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.  Either one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able to work together.  Best regards,  Ken  Jaime Alatorre Av. V.

 Hi Mr. Stelzer l-  I don't believe Ken has had an opportunity to review the suggestions in your outline.  He has a huge stack of mail he hasn't gotten to yet.  Hopefully, by tomorrow, he will have seen it.  Thanks.  Rosalee 
 Thanks, Anabella, as I couldn't figure out why Mr. Lay received it.  Rosalee 
 Hi Tom - this would be good as Ken Lay will not be able to attend next week. He will be out of the country.  Rosalee 
 I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested. Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers.  I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just as soon not feed that speculation.  Look forward to seeing you.  Warm regards,  Ken 
 Ken Lay will not be able to attend.  Rosalee 
 You may have meant to say Enron, but please note you reference that you'd like a career within Dynegy.  Rosalee for Ken Lay 
 Thanks, Michelle.  This will help, I think.  Rosalee 
 Per Barb's request, here is her resume.  Rosie 
 Kenneth L. Lay Chairman of the Board ENRON 
 Hi - it worked.  It's kenneth.lay@enron.com. 
 Ken Lay with Enron will not attend the meetings. 
 Ken Lay will attend. 
 Mr. Lay will not be attending. 
 Hi Maria -  To my knowledge, Mr. Lay has not received his locker assignment.  Thanks.  Rosalee Fleming for Ken Lay. 
 Please delete Kenneth.Lay@enron.com from this communication. 
 Jim: It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio= n,=20 this email includes the following:  An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan= ds.  Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h= ow=20 to remove those impediments.  A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability= to=20 sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20 possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20 order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20 rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I= =20 have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose= d=20 amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable= =20 option.  Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.  Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-= =20 and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20 office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als= o=20 identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed= =20 language.  I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m= e=20 if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi= ng=20 else that I can do to assist you.  Regards, Ken Lay    Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes= =20 in Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands  David Parquet, Vice-President Enron North America 101 California Street, Suite 1950 San Francisco, CA 94111 Phone: 415.782.7820 Fax: 415.782.7851   2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation  Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges  Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took= a=20 step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20 offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o= f=20 distributed generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities  Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.  Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs= or=20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an= d=20 therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20 generation faces. =20  Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru= =20 D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant= =20 output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil= ities.=20 In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to= =20 face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20 interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects= . =20 These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.  3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20  Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward.  Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue  Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.  Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.  Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20  We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options:  Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)  Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20 =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)  Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments.  4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001  Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports= =20 showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe= r=20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al= l=20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer= =20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20 likely. =20  CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20 summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20 estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,= well=20 below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio= n=20 in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power= =20 than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t= o=20 date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t= he=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to = this=20 requirement. =20  Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early= =20 draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve= re=20 supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced= =20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20 utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren= t=20 pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be= =20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.  CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California= =20 should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.  5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis  This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.  As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20 crisis must focus on four issues:  Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency  Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.  The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face= =20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s= =20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20 transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a= ir=20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20 required reductions in pollution emissions.  Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing= =20 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the= =20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo= st=20 effectively and quickly in two ways:  Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand= more=20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou= ld=20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,= =20 through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20 reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D= eal=20 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.  Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:  An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification.

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ= e:  =01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti= cularly=20 in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation= =20 resources. reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20 electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity = in=20 the state. fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris= k=20 of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20 customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for= =20 responding.=20  We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in= =20 excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for= =20 summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time= s=20 that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.  Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access.  Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a= =20 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o= f=20 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from= =20 customer migration. =20  In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20 function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20 non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ= ia=20 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period = in=20 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments= =20 of utility load.  Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative = vehicle:=20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand= . =20 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20 imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers= =20 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ= ia=20 State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend= ed=20 period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc= e=20 in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20 participate in that market.  California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a= =20 series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20 increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without= =20 =01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c= ould=20 amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio= d. =20 In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:= =20 First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20 recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of = AB=20 1890.

Rosie 
 Ken will not be here for the meeting.    Katherine Brown 09/26/2000 11:59 AM 
 Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to bother him with this unless absolutely necessary.  Rosalee 
 Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk to Steve (he is traveling, but said he is trying to get in touch with you). Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.  Talk to you soon.  Rosie 
 Here it is!!  Have a great day!!  Stay warm. 
 Ken will be out of the office.    Sherri Sera 09/21/2000 02:53 PM 
 Good morning -  I was out during the timeframe that this was sent, but Ken Lay did not give it back to us.  He is traveling now and totally inaccessible (on vacation) during the time of the meeting, so he will not be participating.  Rosalee 
 Hi Calvin - just to let you know that Ken is going to be traveling until 10/3, but I will print this out for him to see.  Rosie 
 Thank you, Rebekah.  This works very well for Ken.  Rosie   Rebekah Rushing @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS                09/19/2000 01:23 PM

 OOps, I can't seem to open it!! 
 Cynthia, Ken said to tell you that he told David Sokol we would probably oppose it.  Rosie    Cynthia Sandherr 09/08/2000 04:49 PM 
 Hi Nancy -  Ken asked me to tell you that you can absolutely use him as a reference.  Hope you are doing just great.  Rosalee 
 Hi Jeff -  Ken asked me to advise you that he will be out of the city on March 21. Thanks for including him.  Rosalee 
 Dr. Lay is unable to participate in the conference. 
 Hi Mr. Ramsay -  In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that he would be delighted to participate.  We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board has its meeting.  Rosalee 
 Mr. Lay responded that he is unable to attend.  I know that you already have that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also.  Rosalee Fleming 
 Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire week of September 26.  The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Rosalee 
 Dear Dean Walker -  Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine. 2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on October 13.  Thanks.  Rosalee 
 Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider other dates.  Rosalee 
 Mr. Hines -  To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach.  Rosalee 
 Hi Mr. Moore -  I did hear back from Mr. Lay.  Will September 11 at 3:00 p.m. work for you?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Rosalee 
 Dar, are you on-line?  If so, please answer back.  I have questions.  Well, I'll ask them.  Did you get the wedding pics?  me 
 I seem to have three appointments next week:  Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)  Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)  Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)   I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take awhile.  Rosie 
 Hi Mr. Yergin -  I just wanted to make sure that you knew that Ken does plan to do this.  He did talk to Governor Knowles.  Thanks.  Rosalee 
 Amy, you are a treasure!!!  I know you'll be a treasure of a Mom, too!!  But I'll miss you!!  rosie 
 Hi Mr. Lewis -  Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.  He asked if you would please send him a current bio.  Thanks.  Rosalee 
 Diane, I will definitely show this to Ken, but he has a Dain Rauscher presentation near the Galleria at 8:00 a.m. that morning, so I know he can't attend.  Rosie 
 Hi Mr. Moore -  I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for several weeks, it is already pretty booked up.  I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.  Please advise.  Rosalee 
 Mike, Ken is not attending.  Thanks.  Rosie 
 Michelle, this came through just fine.  His address looks perfect.  Rosalee 
 Katherine, Ken will be on vacation, so I don't think he'll be calling in. However, I'll let you know.  Rosie    Katherine Brown 08/15/2000 11:24 AM 
 Mr. Enloe -  Ken Lay asked me to let you know that regrettably he will be in Europe, so unable to attend the dinner.  Rosalee 
 Liz, I don't know how the address shows up when sent, but they tell us it's kenneth.lay@enron.com.  Talk to you soon, I hope.  Rosie

 Hi Jaime -  Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the dinner for a briefing.  Thanks.  Rosie 
 Mr. Christman:  Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in France, the format looks wonderful.  Unfortunately, Dr. Lay has calendar conflicts and will be unable to participate.  If you should need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.  Tori Wells Executive Assistant 
 Oh, Rob, I'm happy to do so!!  I hope you are on vacation!!  Rosie 
 Hi Rob -  Ken said "If you'll prepare the remarks, I'll be happy to do this".  Rosie    Rob Bradley 07/19/2000 09:51 AM 
 Letter dictated by Ken Lay  Gene:  I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.  Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any further help, please let me know.  Ken 
 Dictated letter from Ken Lay  Dear John:  I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.  I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a summer conference.  The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully considered.  I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too distant future.  Warm regards,  Ken 
 Ken said "John, this looks fine to me.  Why not send it to George for his consideration".  Rosalee for Ken Lay 
 Hi Mr. Grady -  I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, and he said that is great for you to attend.

 Yes, Dennis, we got it by e-mail and fax.  Thanks.

 Hi Deborah -  Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?  Thanks.  Rosalee
