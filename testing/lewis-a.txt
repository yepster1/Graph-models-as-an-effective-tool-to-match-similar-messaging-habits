 Vicky,  Sounds like they've been working you to hard.  You certainly deserve a vacation.  I would like to hear about your adventures overseas.  My address is as follows:   Andy Lewis 3131 Timmons Ln Apt. 1010 Houston, TX  77027    I got a letter from Diem with their new London address.  I figure I'll give them a month or so to move in  before I look into visiting.  Of course, getting time off in this job is easier said than done.  Anyway, enjoy your trip, and I look forward to hearing from you.  -Andy
