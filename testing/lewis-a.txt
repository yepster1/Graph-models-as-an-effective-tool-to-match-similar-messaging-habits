 Adrianne,  I spoke with Yvan Go and Carl Zavattieri.  I left messages for Sam Zhou, but I never heard back from him.  I would recommend we bring in Carl for an onsite interview.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me.  -Andy 3-6278

 Diem,  Not much going on at work.  Brushing up on meteorology 101 and discussing Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.  I have been going to work for only a few hours a day.  Some days I don't go in at all.  Right now, we are waiting for the Judge to approve the sale to UBS.  I think we would get our offers from them sometime soon after.  I have been using the free time to do a little travelling.  We went on a cruise in December and this week I am going to Chicago the 17 - 21.  I plan to go to Boston in February to see my family.  Anyway, my work number is 713-853-6278.  Talk to you soon.  Andy   P.S. Guess what these are:   ................. 
  AyyyyyMayyyyy,  How was your trip?  I hope you were able to get lots of sleep.  Huy tried to get me to go drinking last night, but I was far too tired.  I didn't get done with interviews 	until after 7:00 PM.  Trang said you told her to take care of me while you were gone.  I thought that was very sweet, yet I can't help wondering if you think I can not 	take care of myself (that was a joke by the way).  Kelly sent me Linda's numbers with plenty of attitude.  She mentioned something about you having an abundance of time while she has a scarcity of time.  But you 	can't tell her I told you.  Looks like I gotta go.  I miss you, and look forward to hearing from you.  Love,  Andy 
  Mery,  I have attached the transportation scenario with some prices added.  Unfortunately, I will not be available at 4:00 PM today.  Please call me tomorrow in order to reschedule.  Andy 
  Greg,  One of my concerns regarding the merger is future compensation.  It is well known throughout the industry that Dynegy pays the lowest bonuses.  What incentive do we have to make money next year knowing bonuses in 2002 will be abysmal?  For that matter, what guarantees will be made in order to prevent a massive exodus next year for this reason?  Thank you for your attention,  Andy
