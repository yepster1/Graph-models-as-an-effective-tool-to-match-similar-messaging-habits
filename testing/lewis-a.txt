 to accept an invitation to the program.  Since the deadline for this application is tomorrow, and I have yet to receive this e-mail, I would appreciate you contacting me by phone in order to verify my inclusion.  Andy 3-6278 
 We finally got your postcards this week.  Sandra was excited to receive them. It sounds like your having a blast in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit that part of the world.  I have some friends that are moving to London in January, so I guess that will have to be the first trip I take.  On a different note, this wednesday was a bit like a stick in the eye. However, there's always next week.  Robin's last name is now Zivic, so her new handle is Rhonda Zivic (Honda Civic).  That's it for now.  E.B. 
 Hey Eva,  We got two postcards so far. Sandra was pretty excited.  She said to tell you that she looks forward to the next batch. It sounds like your having a great time in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit that part of the world. 
 Hey Eva,  Got your message, was waiting for you to write more.  I'll have to check with Sandra, but I haven't heard her say if she got your postcards.  Robin came back from her honeymoon and you can't tell when she's blushing she's so red.  The last two AGA's have been great.  One was a 40 cent move and the other was 20 cents (what's better than Wednesdays?).  That's it for now.  Must go see Suey.  - Big Lew 
 What do you mean we're not working hard enough?  You're the one that is never in the office when I call.  Not to mention all those stories Nicole told me about you partying it up in San Francisco.  You know what they say:  All play and no work out west makes the stock price go south.   Andy 
 Hey,  It has been awfully busy now that I'm managing both Gas Daily and Mid-continent Basis.  Luckily, the market has settled down and given me a chance to get up to speed.  Needless to say, I haven't been to any happy hours either.  I did get to go to an Astros game with Natsource a few weeks ago, however.  If I hear of anything I will let you know.  Anyway, looks like it's about quitting time.   - Andy  P.S.  Feel free to call me direct anytime for quotes.
