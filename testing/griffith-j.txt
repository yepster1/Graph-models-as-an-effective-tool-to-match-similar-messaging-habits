er.  Thanks.  John 
 I haven't tested yet, but looks interesting.  Thanks.  John 
 A broker just sent me this today.  I am going to talk to him to get the details after trading.  Thought you would like to know.  Thanks.  John   "Here is the announcement: Reliant Energy Weather Risk Management Group has developed Weather-sensitive Gas Load Indices ("WGLI"),  indices that measure national or regional residential and commercial gas consumption during the heating season. We believe the indices will provide valuable information for gas traders as well as other market participants.  We plan to make a swap market in the indices in the near future. We hope the WGLI swaps will become a new financial tool to help you or your clients to better manage their risks associated with the fluctuation of gas demand." 
 Greg,  I want to thank you so much for all you work on the trade blotter.  We are getting close here.  I put together a list of items to get the thing completely operational.  Below is the list and maybe we could talk today to discuss.  Thanks.  BLOTTER  - rearrange the deal input screen - have Amy's sheet pull deals from access database - get Mike Maggi's computer set up for the access database - build a spreadsheet to take a snapshot of the blotter for Mike Maggi - set up a default month for the deal input screen (possibly an input on the spreadsheet) - have deal input screen popup on the screen that the spreadsheet is open in - on morning macro, include clear trades, clear charm, clear theta and clear recon numbers - separate price and vol on the Fetch Curves button - delete evening macro - add button for settle prices - add button to print position, pnl, options and swap pages (one button) - test multiple user input on the deal input spreadsheet  This list might look like alot, but I think most items will only take a few minutes to correct or change.  Let me know when you get a chance to sit down and talk about this.  Thanks.  John Griffith 
 Everything is going okay.  Dynegy has bought us out.  I think that if I was still in structuring then I might be worried, but I am trading natural gas options and the desk I work for has been very profitable.  I think that the natural gas and power trading floors are the main reason they bought us.  I would think they would like to keep things as they are on these desks, but you never know.  It will take 6-9 months before anything happens.  How are you doing?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I would love to get together sometime.  My phone number is (713) 853-6247.  Call me sometime.  I guess you are working for Jeff Young now?  He used to be my boss.  How is the Europe group?  Are they still the same?  I am not for sure how your company is set up now.  How is married life?  Is you wife in the US now?  Are you still in DC?  Talk to you soon.  John
