ve a total of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point: 40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be present.  Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper.  More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points.  Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure. I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?  I'm available after the Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a meeting time for next week.  Thank you. 
 Pursuant to your request, attached is a very plain-vanilla motion to intervene out of time and motion to expedite that you can provide to your non-Gallup customers if you like.  If you do so, please inform them that we are not providing this as legal advice but merely as an example, and whether they choose to file in this proceeding and the content of what they file is up to their own respective legal and regulatory departments. 
 I'm a little uncomfortable with saying "TW defers to the consensus position of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.  Could we just not say anything on those items?  Or say TW has no comment at this time.  Would the other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues? 
 Recently we approved a "based on utilization" rate in another contract -- the rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component (using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.  Does that make sense to you? 
 I am free for lunch on 12/4.  I'll see if Frazier's available. Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown. 
 Lorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month.  This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed it.  FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly discriminatory.  The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the Cal. gas transportation market -- the Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available.  I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get FERC to accept it.  That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47). 
 (I'll review this after my 9:00 meeting -- thought you might want a copy also.) 
 Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.  The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of $0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be $188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated (I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know what he says. 
 I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked your question yesterday.  "IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  If you need more info, let's talk. 
 I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Mary Kay, that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist. However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does "voluntary" mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is from the order.  A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.  Comments? 
 Can we keep the upside -- I believe the answer is clearly "no" unless/until we get a favorable ruling on our share-the-upside filing.  Til then we're bound by the billing provisions on Sheet 95H. Sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting out there a while...  As for the contract rights of replacement shippers, I would say the tariff language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt. points.  If we don't, and the replacement shipper uses an alt. point and has to pay max rate, releasing shipper gets a refund under our billing provision.  I know Lindy has some clear ideas on what we want here... we can discuss more if you like. 
 Jeff, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me after talking with Lee Hart, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a filing.  I would be happy to talk with Leonard Foster or June Suwara at Sempra about doing the same, but somehow think Sempra might be a tougher customer (don't know why I would think that...).  My suggestion is that we work through Ms. Katz initially.  Anticipating that we might encounter some inertia at Sempra's regulatory dept. -- and to give you an outline to work from when talking to Stefanie -- I put together the attached rough draft of a motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Sempra.  Feel free to send the attached to Stefanie.  However, please do so with the caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal advice to Sempra from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this pleading should ultimately be up to Sempra's legal/regulatory staff.  Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up. 
 Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement conferences.  Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in lieu of a redlined document.  Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas transportation.  CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's system.  Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not been fully described in the CAC document.  To this end, Transwestern proposes that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.  Transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.

 The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.  Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as "maintenance," I'm not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not completely comfortable calling this "force majeure" because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party; however, since the definition does include "binding order of any court or governmental authority," we could possibly say this is force majeure if we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not "maintenance," but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law.  I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.  Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions. 
 Here's what I propose to send to the parties on the 14th.  Take a look, and think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first paragraph.  I propose that we get on the agenda for the March 1 meeting so that we have some time to approach individual parties first.  With your permission, I will forward this to Mr. Dasovich also. 
 Lindy -- FYI.  This is just really informal so I'd prefer you not forward to anyone yet.  Drew and Maria are most familiar with this so I'm going to get their feedback first before setting up a meeting.  I'll get with you before I set a meeting time to see when you're available. 
 Steve and Frank, I would be very interested in your comments on the attached. 
 Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the Commission.  I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I do not expect the agreement to change significantly. 
 My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:  ** In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public.  FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events.  FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996). **  In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not:  the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements.  There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases.  Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything. 
 Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist. There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market services, weren't there? One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language is already general enough to cover us there. The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either. The tariff language as it's currently written says we "shall" issue an OFO, and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty. If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later this afternoon, I'm available. Thanks! S. 
 Approved. 
 Here's my request for rehearing so far.  The marketing folks are helping me with our competitive harm argument and will, I hope, come up with something plausible.  In the meantime, I would appreciate your comments. 
 Spoke with Steve about the swap question.  He wants to talk with you about this before circling back to Knippa.  If you don't hear from him, and want to call him, his # is 281-350-8441.  Re. TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early:  If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.  No other specific damages are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.  (Section 9.2 provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.)  The Gas Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.  Other questions -- let  me know. 
 Drew, what is BNSF? 
 Dear Mr. Henderson:  Attached pursuant to Dave Foti's request is the Substation Maintenance Agreement in Word format with Transwestern's proposed changes shown in redlining.  After you've had a chance to review the agreement, please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  Sincerely,  Susan Scott Counsel for Transwestern Pipeline Company (713) 853-0596 sscott3@enron.com 
 Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:  I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.  For the 3 years I've lived there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on my street, have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several days afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem. I have heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper crop of mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for residents of the Heights this summer.  Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the Heights?  Last year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, but got no response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication that the City of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens.  Any information you can provide would be appreciated.  Sincerely,  Susan Scott 815 Cortlandt St. (713) 853-0596 (daytime phone) sscott3@enron.com 
 Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...  The problem:  As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.  Why the problem exists (you may already know):  Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power."  The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery).  When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority.  Solutions??  I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October). Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.  Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates. We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either of you seen anything to the contrary?  I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few minutes.  Thanks. 
 Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below.  This language is very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates issue.  I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  It is important that we work something out with Phillips today.  By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language (i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in exchange for us making this compromise.  She feels that it would be inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate). 
 Here's the summary we sent you before, with new reference to Hector in redlining.  Call Jeff (713-853-1521) or me (713-853-0596) if you have questions. 
 Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They said they would mull it over, at least.  But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree to it.  Steve has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise. 
 That is weird.  I received your first message.  Dave, Exhibit A of the O&M agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor Facilities.  Do you have this? Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from Nemec.  Martha, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.  Thank you! 
 The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in redlining.  I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.  Many of my changes are simply to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined terms).  In a couple of places, I have questions:  1) In the second opening paragraph, I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if not, ignore my change.  2) Section 4.a.  -- their provision for an adjustment seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party, so I left it in.  If you don't like it, let me know.  3)  In Section 5, I just tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination.  Let me know if this does not agree with your intent.  Please call me with your comments, and let me know how you would like to proceed.  SS (713) 853-0596 
 Brian and Glen,  Based upon a review of the 1/21/00 draft of Motion for Extension of Procedural Schedule, Transwestern Pipeline Company does not wish to join as a party to the motion, and does not plan to oppose the motion.  Sincerely,  Susan Scott 
 The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments? 
 Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off. Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between "Happy Yellow" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to the professionals.  Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around here will join us.  Hope your weekend project was a success.  Talk to you soon!  Love, S. 
 Lorraine, see the attached.  I added "Maximum" and "Minimum" to the chart but don't know whether I got it backwards...anyway, let's talk if you have any questions. 
 On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition. Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure through a discount report. 
 Remember we need to make a filing for our BP Energy deal, which becomes effective Dec. 1.  (Mary, I think you and I talked about this several weeks ago).  The contract simply includes a right of first refusal for BP Energy. The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation. The filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract provision is described. Let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance). I have a conf. call from 2 to 3 but otherwise should be available if you want to give me a call. 
 Hey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!  The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel sitting in the back yard!  Time to work. Try to take it easy! S 
 Christine, you need a comma between July and August.  Otherwise this looks fine. 
 Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.  Your written comments would be appreciated. 
 I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for rehearing? 
 Lorraine, please forward the attached to Ed Meaders. 
 I just rely on the market services folks to do the right thing.  Tell me if you think this is yet another area in which I have too much faith in our business people. 
 Janet, can you open the attachment? 
 I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad. Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers. 
 Please print out the attached on my letterhead & bring it over to me.  Thank you!! 
 For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement. The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of the competing settlements. I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have questions. S. 
 Janet -- could you please try to find the files Maria references in her e-mail, and I'll take it from there.  Thanks! 
 Lorraine, here is the letter.  You will need to fill in the address; otherwise it's ready to go.  Let me know if you need anything else (including initialling). 
 Jeff, attached is our summary of the Transwestern receipt point proposal for inclusion in CAC's settlement proposal.  I hope that this is helpful.  If you have any comments, please let me know. 
 Drew, here is the memo.  I know you will add your own spin before sending it on to Cordes.  However, if there is anything you want me to fix, please do not hesitate to call. 
 Mary Kay -- please see the attached -- Red Cedar has essentially asked us for acknowledgement that TW is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport gas for producers even though Red Cedar itself does not have title to the gas.  Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you. 
 OK, here's my first attempt.  Although I think Red Cedar's lawyers might be looking for more, they have not specifically requested it, so I decided to stick to making only the statements Ed Meaders mentioned in his 2 voice mails.  I believe this may suffice. 
 Lorraine, here is the new language for the discount letter.  You might want to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to make sure I got the right version (or I'll do it on Monday).  Let me know if you have questions.  I just ran it by Drew and he is OK with it. 
 The Mark Morris group performance is the last weekend of this month, the 27th - 29th.  See the website www.spahouston.org and click on "Program Notes" for a detailed description.  Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m. as early as we can manage. I'm not picky about where we go for dinner, but was thinking Bill might enjoy going to the Bitter End brew pub -- I'm sure they don't take reservations but it should not be a problem if we go early enough.  The landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird! Can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway.  We'll call tomorrow a.m. if not sooner!  Have a good day! 
 Rich, would you please add Tim Aron to your distribution list for the Gallup Weekly Updates, and also forward him your latest?  He is working on New Mexico regulatory and legislative issues pertaining to our compression contract, and I thought your updates would help keep him in the loop.  Thank you. 
 Lindy, do you know offhand whether our OBAs with PG&E and SoCal deviate from the usual 10% tolerance provided for in our tariff form OBA?  If not, who do you think might be able to tell me? 
 As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some reading and here are my thoughts.  The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but "fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable...  In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means. As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably. However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a more in-depth report. 
 I've reviewed the IGS market development agreement pursuant to your request. It expires 2/29/00.  The agreement requires the parties to meet 90 days prior to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate us to agree to any such extension.  As you know, I have a conflict tomorrow at 10, but would be happy to provide any other information you need for the meeting. 
 Our consulting agreement with IGS for services related to the CPUC proceeding expired 12/31/99 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties. Given the upcoming proceedings, I'd recommend that we act on this sooner rather than later...let me know and I'll draft a brief letter to Mark Baldwin. 
 Hi Mum!  Ann and I saw "Mr. Ripley" and I lay awake last night wondering how else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat!  I think I need to go to the movies more often; perhaps it will help me avoid this blurring of film and reality.  My tendency is to really get involved when I see them on the big screen!  Might be going to San Francisco next week.  I'd really like to go.  We'll see.  Probably I will come to Austin on Saturday but I've not heard from the landscaper yet.  I doubt they will be working on the weekend though.  Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Houston today.  Love, Sooz 
 Steve, for your information, the case in which the Commission denied ECT's petition for a limited waiver of the shipper must have title rule appears at 84 FERC P 61,222. 
 Attached is Shelley Corman's response to Jeff Dasovich, based on conversations with Drew and me.  Accordingly, I would advise you not to participate in the conference call Jeff is setting up for tomorrow.  Questions -- give me a call. 
 I'm attaching an article that I just received about the CPUC's and Indicated Shippers' protests of the recent ENA deal on El Paso.   I have a call in to Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you in that loop in case you get any inquiries.  (My initial, unofficial reaction is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the fact that ENA and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no difference to the FERC.)  Until further notice, I would avoid any communication with ENA on these issues.  If you have any questions, please e-mail or call me (x30596). 
 Anyway, Ann isn't coming on Friday because she can't stand it that everyone is a couple, so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend  to a dinner party given by some people she doesn't even know.  Although I am trying very hard to be understanding, I'm not doing a very good job.  When I was in her situation, I seem to remember enjoying my best friends' company whether I had a date or not!  But that's just me.  Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin.  We certainly are here. If you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to Cabo, I'll come before you leave and help you with the Clinique Tan-In-A-Tube!  (You will still have to wear sunscreen).  What are your trip dates again?  Have a good day!  Love, Sooz 
 Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway!  Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything interesting happens I'll let you know. 
 Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!  My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!  Everyone tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.  Example: over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to shut up.  Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a message.  Of course, everyone but me thinks it is really cute.  Hope your holiday was really great!

 Drew, I've attached my proposed changes to the Red Cedar contract.  Our beloved Min/Max Language became a bit problematic, as you can see.  I'd welcome your comments on this. 
 Drew, here's an excerpt from a FERC letter order accepting for filing a nonconforming agreement filed by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to do, if I understand the concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at DMP but he (like everyone else) is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in the docket I assume there were no problems with the filing.  I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file as nego. rate approach. If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I will draft something and send it your way.  * * * The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service under DMP's Rate Schedule FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement specifies that KGS will pay a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible transportation service rate as set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as KGS' maximum daily reservation quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) identifies five primary delivery points for KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to the above negotiated rate so that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm rate schedule. 
 Oops, wrong one -- I meant MK had comments on Red Cedar.  This one for Duke is OK. 
 Drew -- see MK's comments.  I'm trying to come up with some new language to address her concerns. 
 Did Stan make the call to FERC, I wonder. 
 I made a couple of minor changes.  Here are plain and redlined versions (I turned the tracker off on the plain one).    Also, be sure to fill in the contract #. 
 Thanks.  Lindy and I are going to look at whether any changes will need to be made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you. 
 no comments this month 
 See the attached (one shows redlining, the other does not) and let me know if you have further questions.

 This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it directly to Drew and Maria.  How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about corporate etiquette?  I wonder. On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it. 
 Hey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the house enjoying both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it was a good birthday. Have a good day! 
 John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the transfer is $0.  This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with the above scenario.  If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call me (x30596). 
 Bryan,  Are you still having a great time?  So what is Bali like?  The only images I can summon are Gauguin's paintings, but weren't those of Tahiti?  Things are pretty good here.  Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas cheer, etc.  Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.  Really, though, I think I would much rather be in Bali.  Take care.  S. 
 Janet, please calendar these meetings for me.  Thanks. 
 I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.  Mum, only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes. You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!)  Karin, I am probably going to make a stop at Macy's or Neiman's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up the Estee Lauder for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 75261.151@compuserve.com.  That's all this elf knows.    * new trendy spelling with capital letter within the word 
 Here is a kitty for your office.  I really miss mine now that they are in Kitty Jail! 
 Contrary to popular belief I am alive...The 22nd works for me too (although given my current work situation I'm sure I'd be late - better late than never, right?)  Anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( I've been to Benji's - great food and heard really good things about Ousie's table as well).  But Laura was right, Lisa is currently my social planner - how scarey is that? - so she'll make sure I know what's going on.  Can't wait to see you guys, Susan    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer). Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note and let me know what's new in your life.  Love you guys, Susan  Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well. We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in need of a good chat.  Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.  Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say "Hi" and I'll be glued to the TV set just like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.  Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the "Fam".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?  Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success. 
 Drew -- I worked with Jeff on this draft so it already contains my comments. 
 The only one I'm still not really sure about is Stanfield, which is in red.

 That was too cute.  How's your week been going?  I can't wait to come out next week...it will be so nice to get away for a while.  Susan    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Does anyone know this person or his organization?  Is this something our membership might be interested in?  Frankly I have been too busy to think about this -- if you have any comments let's talk.  Susan Scott 713-853-0596 
 Hey Bronwyn,  I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next time I see him.  So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?  Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.  Talk to you soon, Susan       Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 The deal has been rebooked.  Thanks 
 Hey guys,  Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).  Susan 
 Here are some of the main curves....attached is a file containing the rest. 
 Hey Lisa,  Good job on the organization.  Do you have any recommendations for what I could bring or is there anything you think we really need?  Also, just to double check, we're getting together next Monday night right?  Susan 
 Sorry Beatrice,  I sent this to Greg and forgot to send it to you as well.  This is a preliminary file until I have the official NGI settle prices for Chicago City Gate and Socal.  Let me know it you have any questions.  Susan 
 Couple of minor changes.  Looking good! 
 Call me with any questions.  I'll send you the final version when I have the official NGI settle prices.  Susan 
 Please include my name on the list of attendants for the brown bag tomorrow.  Thank you, Susan Scott 
 Dan,  I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.  While dealing with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.  The documents and contracts seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.  Still, I wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather than simply discard them.  If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is limited up here).  Thanks, Susan 
 Larry,  For some reason the mail router keeps rejecting the files I'm trying to send you (GDOpt&Swap and PipePos).  If you have access to the rest of the system here you should be able to get into the PipOpt folder with out any problems. If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure out a way to email you these files.  Give me a call at 713-853-1455 if you need anything.  I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&L from Friday if you want to take a look at that.  I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an answer.  Also, there was a confirm that came in for you Friday with Amerex: They show you Buying a 1/day  BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call Option at $0.26.  The counterparty was Cinergy...Let me know if this is a good trade and we'll get it loaded into the system.  Thanks, Susan

 The apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning.  If I don't here from you via email/msngr  by the end of tonight I'm going to forge one and fax it to them.  Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't mind.  Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.  Hope things are going well.  I actually worked 21 straight hours the other day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. 
 FYI.  Jan, I know Shelley's out; I left her a voice mail. 
 Great minds.... 
 Well, how does it feel to be back?  I'm sure, even though our fair city can't compete with London for history and culture, there are a few things you've missed about this place.  Hope the flight back was good and I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.  Susan 
 If you could run the same valuation for Deal #'s QC1431.1 and QC1431.2 using Post-id 956785, we could verify that they changes you've made correctly value the basis offset whether a deal index flat or index +/- .  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks, Susan 
 The deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options.  I'm going to send Shouan an Index +/- deal as well so that he can verify that the basis offset is valuing correctly in both situations. 
 Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I could probably muster up the energy.  Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.  Do I need to do anything to sign up for the run?

 Okay...My itinerary is as follows:  Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15 pm.  If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.  I am so excited to be coming out there - -  I really need a break from Houston...not to mention work.  The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would love to meet your friends.  Also, please don't feel like you have to plan the whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.  See you in a couple of weeks, Susan 
 Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.  Susan    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Charles Bradley Scott....hope the wedding plans are still going well.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference. The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests. I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. 
 I found the picture from Tin Hall the other night and that guy at Whataburger was definitely one of the "cute cowboys."  How weird is that?  Anyway, hope you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly. I guess I'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time, hopefully, I'll know more about my London prospects.  Susan 
 I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist and was always coming up with theories herself.  I'd concluded that breasts were to sex what pillows were to sleep.  "Guys might think they want a pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one." She'd said, "Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired." 
 Start at the bottom and work your way up....I'd forgotten this is how I get over guys, flush-out the shortcomings of their wit. 
 It was very small and petty of me, but I couldn't resist.  Start with the last message and work your way up to get the full story.  Good luck studying, Susan 
 Although, as a women, "cojones" aren't necessarily the best attribute to have...there never has been, nor will there ever be a question of my possessing them - even you would have to concede that much.  As for the bet, if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little bit of a "problem" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got. Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference opponents is really helping to ease that blow.  Speaking of feather's in the conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the Big 12 - will wonders never cease.  My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to type that much ).  UCLA could stand a chance next year if the NFL doesn't prove too tempting to some of your vets...how does that saying go,  "Like rats fleeing a sinking ship?" 
 Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .  Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie co-workers through this trying time.  Susan  (Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are an "Ag" man now.) 
 Hey Chris,  I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment complex can send you some info.  regarding getting your name taken off of our lease.  If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass it along to them.  Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving and all.  I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with both of our parents and extended family members.  Have a great holiday and root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).  Love, Susan 
 Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  Unfortunately, I'm not a betting woman (I'm afraid any team I bet on is automatically jinxed and I can't vo
