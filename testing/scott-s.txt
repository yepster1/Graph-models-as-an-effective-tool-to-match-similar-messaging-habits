y Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What does your heart want for your second wish?" Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."  At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her.  Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke "You have one more wish, what shall you have?" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says"; "I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and handsome young man".  Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet.  The Fairy Godmother again spoke: "Congratulations, Cinderella.  Enjoy your new life." And, with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young muscular arms.  He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered:  "I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?" 
 I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Mary Kay, that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist. However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does "voluntary" mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is from the order.  A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.  Comments? 
 Agustin,  You are right, the correct deal number for Industrias del Etileno is just NW9742 (legs 1 & 2).  Susan    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Lexi,  I will be able to attend and am going to try to get to Austin in time for the faculty lunch.  I will let you know if I can make the lunch for sure after I've worked out my travel arrangements.  Thanks, Susan 
 Okay, I have to admit it is somewhat of a pansy schedule and it is going to be like that for about the next three years.  However, this season will give us the perfect opportunity to get all of our freshman and sophomores the necessary experience needed to win the National title two to three years from now.  Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.  With the #1 recruiting class in the country last year and a top 5 class this year the future looks bright for the Longhorns.  Besides, our stadium's on campus and we've sold over 40,000 season tickets...the games are bound to be fun regardless of how weak the opponents may be.  Counter?  Shorty 
 Well, this may go down as one of my absolute worst weeks ever.  Hope yours was better and that you made a full recovery from Steak Night. 
 Sorry I didn't get a chance to buy you a beer last night - we got there late.  I owe you one.  Hope you had a great birthday. 
 Sorry I couldn't make it for cake last night.  I had to work late last night...Big Shock!!!  Anyway, hope it was fun and that you're having a great week.  Mine has been pretty busy work wise.  I'm sure you're curious about Mr. Noble.  All I can say right now is that, while I definitely still like him (we had a great time Sunday), I am some what annoyed with him right now...he's been very wishy-washy the first half of this week.  I'm not real sure what I'm going to do about it, but I'm sure I'll think of something. 
 Fly me to the moon. 
 Lesli,  I am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below. Just so you know, there are going to be several more deals that will need to be rebooked as soon as the CP's are set up.  If you could just let me know when the new CP's are set-up I will rebook the other deals as well.  Thanks,  Susan 31455 . 
 Same dude...and he is good.  We're going to Steak Night tonight at Little Woodrows which of course makes me happy.  Also, I just sent him a list of all the UT games so he can start planning to attend.  As soon as he decides on a first game I'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and others.  That's a lot of prep work.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Your own personal palm pilot hard at work.  As promised, here's a list of UT's games this season...color coded for your convenience of course.  Sep 9                UL Lafayette,  12:30pm  Sep 16              at Stanford,   10:15pm  Sep 23              Houston,   TBA  Sep 30              Oklahoma St.,  TBA  Oct 7                 Oklahoma,   3:30pm  (a.k.a. "OU Weekend"...this is a huge game...the two teams meet halfway at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas)  Oct 14               at Colorado,  TBA  Oct 21               Missouri,   TBA  Oct 28               Baylor,   TBA  Nov 4                at Texas Tech,  2:00pm  Nov 11              at Kansas,   TBA  Nov 24              Texas A&M,   3:30pm  (Thanksgiving Weekend)  All Times Eastern  * Home games are in burnt orange...what else? 
 I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked your question yesterday.  "IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  If you need more info, let's talk. 
 The counterparty for that deal is Enron Omaha and the contact is Larry Paulou.  I am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the counterparty as New this morning.  Let me know if there is anything else you need. 
 Hey there yourself,  Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.  I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents.  As much fun as they are, I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.  As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all this week (we are two very busy people).  But, we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not quite so formal about dates etc.  In one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read.  Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.  Hopefully, if we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair that is a U.T. game).  Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.  I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.  Also, I'm going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter Julie.  Needless to say I am very excited.  Talk to you  guys soon, Susan    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D)  The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a very fun girl.  Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch. Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.  Shorty  -- Due to the lack of response yesterday, I'm beginning to worry about your success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around to it. 
 Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully.  At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.  However, having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors.  Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the memory of an elephant).  I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32.  Now back to what's really important...you.  Thought you'd like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and your needs. 
 There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it. -Mary Little 
 Hey,  My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so today should be a piece of cake).  I know you guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it paid off and the presentation went well yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in the short term, I'm not sure that was necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit (so were you able to resist the red wine this time, you lush?).  In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've attached little story for you...I got a pretty good chuckle out of this one.  PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as usual, had a great time.

 I know how much you're looking forward to "Ted's Weekend of Rest and Relaxation" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you an out.  I can find someone else to help me if you want to bail (I know how important your pool-side time is - Remember it's all about you and your needs."  Just let me know.    FYI:  Galveston does not look like this...

Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?

The researchers also discovered other similarities between the two, but can't remember what they are." ---Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show, August 22  4.  "I haven't committed a crime.

 You know I was just teasing, right?  And, no dating is definitely not a bad thing.  As for being or not being fortunate enough, just remember...your good enough, your smart enough and dog-gonnit people like you.  Have fun tomorrow night and try up that fortune. 
 Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.  The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of $0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be $188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated (I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know what he says. 
 Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.  As for the jokes, I am very afraid and yet undaunted.  Do me one last favor and tell Darren I said he's a real funny guy and that there will, at some point, be appropriate pay-back. 
 Hey,  I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates below.  They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would boost my B.S. factor would be much appreciated.  I seem to remember you mentioning John Massey on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very rarely, been known to be wrong.  Hope your day is going well and that you aren't having to carry Darren too much.  Evan Betzer Jay Epstein Bill Keeney John Massey Milind Pasad Kevin Ruscitti Jennifer Adams Farzad Farhangnia Gautam Gupta Claudio Ribeiro Doug Sewell  -- I finally watched the movie last night.  I laughed, I cried...it became a part of me.  Honestly though, it was a very funny flick.  So did John or Fritz pass along the "Bible" to you?  (Whoever it was you can thank them for me.) 
 Okay, I'm dying to know...What was wrong with the car?  Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do you have to go get it.  (Don't forget I need to get your parking pass to you.)  As for the home vs. theater viewing...I seem to be more of a home-body these days as well. 
 Evidently, in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go to the theatre.  Somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home viewing experience...namely the viewing. 
 I've managed to "handle" myself for almost 24 years just fine, thank you very much...Evidently someone thinks they're pretty irresistible. 
 Okay, okay...The real Susan is back.  So, do you think I should sport the leopard pants to the party?  By the way, your personal taxi service is on call Sunday  so just let me know when you need to be picked up (you're flying out of intercontinental, right?). 
 Look at you trying to bring me out of my shell.  I don't know if I'm really ready though to meet so many new people.  Remember...I am a shy, retiring wall-flower. 
 I'll drive you to the airport tonight...IF I get to come over for a swim Sunday. (Believe me, my motives are purely selfish - your pool is so much "cooler" than mine.)  -- By the way, even with our slight car problem I had a great time last night.  You're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a valiant effort). 
 Hey Handsome,  I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable hour today.  Unfortunately, it is "bid-week" (Nat Gas trading thing which translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked against me.  Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m. is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate when we get closer to 4:30 p.m. and I have a better idea where I stand. Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember, your body's not used to it.  Susan

 A good wit is a terrible thing to waste...  As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name the time and place.  Also, there is no need to forego the nice fun restaurant for tomorrow night just because I have to be a smart-ass every once in a while. 
 Hey Bo,  I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).  Sissy  By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We may have to watch this one at some point.  "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond movie, it comes with so much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to earlier famous vintages; I guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one. 
 Ted,  I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T. football game was Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.  Shorty  FYI - U.T. plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off) 
 Ted,  My day is going quite well, actually.  I managed to sleep in past 6:30 a.m. this morning and did not work-out so I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to respect you in the light of your "rule-breaking", but I'm going to try to look past that.  I'm heading to lunch right now - yes, I am actually leaving the building - so the day just keeps getting better and better.  As for last night, I had a really good time too and am glad you were able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out Friday.  Talk to you soon.  Susan  -- By the way, I'm very relieved to hear about the buckle. 
 Sounds good to me...Coincidentally, a made service will be coming to clean my car this evening  Susan 
 Hey Math-Wiz,  I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea. Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)  Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).  Susan 
 Fifth grade assignment  The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories.  Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  "Now, Lucy?"  "Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."  "Johnny do you have a story to share?"  "Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob. Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands." "Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"  "Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking." 
 There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a non-native Texan acquiring western wear.  Remember slow and steady wins the race.  One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.  -- I'm intrigued...what exactly is the Hawaiian Biker ensemble? 
 Ted,  I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.  So, you may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to bring up the site.  Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.  Still, I think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to project.  http://www.bucklesofestes.com/images/image123a.jpg   If you'd rather shop around try these (there are some outstanding designs)...   http://www.bucklesofestes.com/  http://www.lazyassranch.com/   Disclaimer:   Please realize these sites were sent in jest.  If you actually don any of the items contained within them I may be forced to sever all ties and deny ever having known you. 
 Number 8 made me think of you...  Top Ten Signs Your Amish Teen is in Trouble  10. Sometimes stays in bed till after 6am.  9. In his sock drawer, you find pictures of women without bonnets.  8. Shows up at barn raisings in full "Kiss" makeup.  7. When you criticize him, he yells, "Thou sucketh!"  6. His name is Jebediah, but he goes by "Jeb Daddy."  5. Defiantly says, "If I had a radio, I'd listen to rap."  4. You come upon his secret stash of colorful socks.  3. Uses slang expression: "Talk to the hand, cause the beard ain't listening."  2. Was recently pulled over for "driving under the influence of cottage cheese."  1. He's wearing his big black hat backwards.

 Lorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month.  This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed it.  FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly discriminatory.  The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the Cal. gas transportation market -- the Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available.  I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get FERC to accept it.  That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47). 
 Thanks for the joke, it provided me with a well needed chuckle (You and Darren definitely have too much time on your hands).  As for the hat/casual western theme, we are going to have to go to make a trip to Blanco's or Tin Hall sometime so I can don the full regalia. 
 Just because your trader is out of town on vacation doesn't mean he can't get a hold of you and make life less than pleasant.  How a person can be in Hilton Head, SC and still sound like he's going to have a heart attack is beyond me. 
 Hey yourself,  Actually, my day is going very well.  It just so happens that my trader is out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.  All I want to know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).  Anyway, my roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night sounds good.  Just fill me in on the details.  Susan  PS - I'll be purchasing my neon, leopard-print cowboy hat shortly. 
 Ted,  I spoke with Shanna a little while ago about your friend and the apartment and she said she was fine with the deal.  Talk to you later.  Susan 
 Ted,  Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of indulgence and excess.  It took everything I had to get in the car and start the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before heading out).  As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the least I could do.  After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this weekend.  So, dinner Saturday sounds good.  As it stands right now, I am having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.  Susan  -- (H) 713-622-2788 
 Hi yourself,  Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.  Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run through the stats:  Height :   6'2" - 6'3" Weight : about 225 lbs. Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where) Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it may be more of an issue for him than me. Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA  ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family. Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion) His dad was in the Navy Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of humor and likes to laugh He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in the hill country  Best Quotes:    "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots." "Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and three of them are married." "Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker than any group of women I've ever met." "I really want to learn how to two step."  So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, the job hunt and everything else is going.  Susan    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Hey Ted,  Just wanted to check and see if you guys are still going planning on going tonight.  We have been having some major systems issues today so I'm about to really throw myself into my work in an effort to get out of here at a reasonable time.  Susan 
 Yes...I am a true Longhorn.  I think that's why I like Steak Night so much. I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).  Anyway, Wednesday night sounds good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be able to get there before 7:30.  Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any bloodshed).  I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it should a good group.  Susan 
 Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Austin, I have a wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to share.  Susan 
 This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there exist some semblence of reason.  I remembered you mentioning that neither you nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.  So...I thought I should let you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B. Anyway it should be pretty good.  Music starts at 9:00. 
 Recently we approved a "based on utilization" rate in another contract -- the rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component (using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.  Does that make sense to you? 
 Read the very bottom....  Compliments of your minion. 
 The man who thinks he can do without the world is indeed mistaken; but the man who thinks the world cannot do without him is mistaken even worse. -Francois, duc de La Rochefoucauld 
 The Word of the Day for May 19 is:=20  weird =01=07 \WEERD\ =01=07 (adjective)=20 *1 : of, relating to, or caused by witchcraft or the=20 supernatural : magical=20 2 : of strange or extraordinary character : odd, fantasti= c=20  Example sentence: "Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect." (Louisa= =20 May Alcott, Little Women)=20  Did you know? You may know today's word as a generalized term for anyth= ing unusual, but "weird" also has older meanings that are mor= e specific. "Weird" derives from the Old English noun "wyrd= ," essentially meaning "fate." By the late 8th century, the= =20 plural "wyrde" had begun to appear in texts as a gloss for=20 "Parcae," the Latin name for the Fates -- three goddesses who spun, measured, and cut the thread of life. In the 15th and 16t= h centuries, Scots authors employed "werd" or "weird" in th= e phrase "weird sisters" to refer to the Fates. William Shakespeare adopted this usage in Macbeth, in which the "weird sisters" are depicted as three witches. Subsequent adjectival use of "weird" grew out of a reinterpretation = of=20 the "weird" in Shakespeare. 
 ARIES  HOROSCOPE:   Weekly    For May 2000: Reassess your goals and friendships. Things have changed. Are you satisfied with your job, relationships, and immediate future? May brings things to light that have been buried or disguised. Take a cool calm steady look at what surfaces. . . and decide if a change in direction is warranted. It's clear that your work scenario needs refurbishing and your daily schedule cries out for major rehab. But first and foremost, you'll get your second wind by dropping tension and frustration mid month, increasing the probability for better relations with friends, coworkers, and relatives. Try to establish healthy, positive change no later than the Full Moon. Take steps to insure your financial and business future on or before May 28. 
 AQUARIUS  HOROSCOPE:    Weekly    For May 15-21: You're moving away from one base of operations into another. Your priorities and basic requirements are also shifting. You find yourself relying less on something you've clung to in the past -- and moving closer to something newer, fresher, and more invigorating. You've got a rage to live and a burning desire for peak experiences. Middle of the road choices won't do it for you. Your hankering to push the envelope could get you into hot water with the old guard and certain close associates or relatives -- possibly because they're afraid of being replaced. But the genie is already out of the bottle, Aquarius. You can't unlearn what you've already tasted. Change is rolling in on its own power now. Go with it. . . and try to enjoy the ride. . .

 I'm a little uncomfortable with saying "TW defers to the consensus position of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.  Could we just not say anything on those items?  Or say TW has no comment at this time.  Would the other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?

 Hi Mark...me again.  You really are missing my presence in the controls group aren't you? 
 I could let the fluff comment fly if you were referring to a woman that had= =20 written such works in present day, but given that Austen was dealing with a= =20 completely different world with decidedly different expectations for the=20 women in it  I cannot.  The fact that she was able to challenge those limit= ed=20 expectations and never allow her heroines to sell themselves short or=20 compromise their character should not be taken for granted.  Yes, there is = a=20 definite romantic bent to her works, but in addition their is amazing insig= ht=20 into people, their motives, their struggles and their capacity to surprise= =20 even themselves.  And in the end, what conquers in her novels is the union = of=20 two individuals who have the utmost respect and appreciation for each other= 's=20 minds and characters not the unequal and servile relationships that=20 constituted the norm for that time. 
 May there always be work for your hands to do, May your purse always hold a coin or two. May the sun always shine warm on your windowpane, May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain. May the hand of a friend always be near you, And may God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you. -- Irish Blessing 
 Today we remember Jane Austen, the British writer born on this date in 1775= .=20 Austen depreciated herself as a "miniaturist" and a domestic novelist of=20 restricted scope, but her literary legacy is large. She was also able to la= y=20 self-deprecation aside, however, and in Northanger Abbey she declared that= =20 novels -- her chosen genre -- are works in which "the greatest powers of th= e=20 mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, t= he=20 happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and= =20 humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language."=01(  Austen's work brims with general statements that are contradicted by the=20 people in her stories. For instance, Pride and Prejudice opens by noting th= at=20 "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of= a=20 good fortune, must be in want of a wife." The book then describes Mrs.=20 Bennett, mother of a household full of marriageable daughters as "a woman o= f=20 mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper." As Austen=20 acquaints us with the tale of each daughter's engagements, she=20 wonders,                    "For what do we live, but to make sport for our= =20 neighbors and  laugh at them in our turn?"As Austen acquaints us with the= =20 tale of each daughter's engagements, she wonders, "For what do we live, but= =20 to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?" 
 Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last night.  They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some faces with the names.  At one point I believe my Dad even stated, "I love this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday." (An idle threat though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the topical conversational range ever present at "Steak Night".  Our own, though at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.  Now on to the "food for thought"...I had a hard time narrowing down my selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).  "Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow." -- Dorothy Thompson  "One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community." -- Albert Einstein  "Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh." --W.H. Auden  "Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else." -- Steven Ouellette  "The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy." -- Florence Scovel Shinn  "We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment." -- Jim Rohn 
 Sorry I didn't return your call last night, Lisa and I went to hear Julie Andrews speak at Jones Hall and didn't get home until after 10:00 p.m. Knowing what a precious commodity sleep is I refrained from possibly disturbing your own. 
 "The greatest good we can do for others is not to share our riches with them, but to reveal their own." - Author Unknown  "One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life.

 "1. Do what's right. Be on time, be polite, and be honest; remain free from drugs; and if you have any questions, get out your Bible. 2. Do your best. Mediocrity is unacceptable when you are capable of doing better. 3. Treat others as you want to be treated. Practice love and understanding." -- Lou Holtz (Three rules for success)  May there always be work for your hands to do, May your purse always hold a coin or two. May the sun always shine warm on your windowpane, May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain.

 Pursuant to your request, attached is a very plain-vanilla motion to intervene out of time and motion to expedite that you can provide to your non-Gallup customers if you like.  If you do so, please inform them that we are not providing this as legal advice but merely as an example, and whether they choose to file in this proceeding and the content of what they file is up to their own respective legal and regulatory departments. 
 Where were you last night? 
 Tell Lisa that EOL sucks...I've had to rebook 40 screwed up deals...hope to be there by 7:00 
 Turns out my boss is going to get to Teala's at @ 5:00.  So if you want to show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.  I know Ben, Nick and possibly Sunil are planning on going so you may want to see when they are planning on getting there. 
 I'm finally having my going away Happy Hour with my old group tonight so I'm out.   Sorry.  Hope you guys have fun (Don't forget Woody's is a cheese-fest) 
 I too enjoyed our talk last night ( I'm always interested in other viewpoints, it is only by examining them that we challenge our own).  The Happy Hour tonight is at Teala's on West Dallas.  My recommendation is that you plan on arriving at 7:00 or later.  Hopefully by that time my old manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on his tab.  I must admit, the job just keeps sounding better and better.  P.S. Thanks for the compliment...that's a quality I like being associated with. 
 While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now more appropriate than ever.  One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses. I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of people whom you respect.)  To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger. 
 *31455 
 I'm sure we can find you a ride over there.  What time do you think you're going to be finished-up here? 
 Are you still going to run? 
 I have purchased 4 tickets to Saturday night's show.  Maybe we can all go out to dinner before-hand or I wouldn't mind having everyone over to my place for a little wine and food?  Also, I don't think I can make this week's Tasters dinner because my old group is having a belated going away happy hour in honour of me.  PARTAY!!! 
 no comments this month 
 As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion, Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point: 40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be present.  Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper.  More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points.  Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure. I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?  I'm available after the Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a meeting time for next week.  Thank you. 
 By the way, when are you leaving for NY/moving all of your stuff?  And, when's your last day at the Big "E"? 
 I will most likely have a good headstart by the time you get there. 
 What time are you thinking about getting over there? 
 It is tonight and it looks as though we will have great weather.  I'm planning on getting there ASAP as I've had a rough week already and need some beer in a bucket. 
 I apologise for the delay in my response to your email.  Thank you for contacting me regarding the rotational opportunity in your group.  While it sounds intriguing, I will not be able to pursue it as I have already begun my second rotation with ENA.  However, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your group and any possible future rotations.  Please let me know if you would be able to meet at some later date.  Thank you again. 
 I've called and checked before and evidently the steak cook comes rain, sleet, snow or hail.  So unless everyone's opposed to eating inside, if it's raining, we can go no matter what. 
 Who all would you like on your guest list for tomorrow?  Regular crew? 
 I may have to start training now for that. 
 In honour of your departure I think it is only right that we do "Red Meat" one more time.  I feel as though I've said this a lot lately but...Congratulations.  I don't want to devalue the statement by repeating it over and over again so just know that I am completely sincere when I say it. The money sounds fantastic, although I hope that aside from the money you enjoy and are challenged by your new role.  I may not know you inside and out but I do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast-paced environment to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will provide that for you.  Also, the step up position-wise is great and I think deserved.  As far as being scared goes, that'll be our little secret.  You do know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done.  I guess this means I'll have a good excuse to visit NY. 
 Sure, why the heck not.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.  With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).  On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service.  As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer them. 
 O.K.  Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.  Let me know if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the tickets today over the phone or on the internet.  Also, I was trying to remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.  I think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).  I promise I'm good for the money.  Also, was wondering if you're still interested in the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.  Just let me know.  Hope your having a wonderful day. 
 I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc. but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation. Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions. 
 Again Mark I am flattered that you include me in these explanations...but I don't really need them anymore. 
 Ben was actually already planning on going.  In fact he informed me he would be bringing a friend from Canada.  FYI - I didn't know there was a "friend" in Canada until very recently (although I had my suspicions) and further more had never heard a name until today.  Regardless, any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine.  Also, Nick is going to bring Amy (his significant other).  Should be an interesting evening. 
 It looks like people are going to start arriving around 7:00 so I'd say just show up after your done running and getting all pretty.  I'm sure we'll all be there till at least 10:00. 
 So are you going tonight or not? 
 You're the greatest.  I think Little Woodrow's is on for tonight although I'm still waiting to see if my brother and his wife want to go out tonight (he leaves for South Korea Sunday), if they're a no go I will be on the deck with a bucket of beer.  P.S. You are in peak physical condition. 
 Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?  I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one important caveat.  The individuals in question must be in the same strata.  I would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.  Of course if one is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy gets really old and slow.  Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?  Or do you not identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing? 
 No I'm not close b/c I can't take off 2hrs from work to go run in the park. However, I am getting up every morning at 6 to go run so that ought to count for extra.  Besides when did this become a contest I wouldn't think you'd consider me a worthy adversary... at least not yet.  I do know the model you're speaking of, but isn't she married to some billionaire in Venezuela? 
 The post-id should be 766556.  I am still inputting the unofficial post-id on a daily basis in that file that was created for you all, O:\Erms\erms_adm\GasDaily\GDailyDrop.  Let me know if there's anything else I can do. 
 See my changes on the attached. 
 How was NY? 
 Just wanted to ease your mind and let you know that I have not discussed your impending move with anyone save those you have already informed.  I am well aware of the sensitivity of the subject.  Believe it or not, sometimes I am able to keep my mouth shut. 
 Ginger,  I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday. However, given that it is bid-week, I cannot absolutely guarantee my attendance.  If it is at all possible for me to include myself with the caveat that I may have to pull-out last minute I would really appreciate the opportunity.  Please let me know if this is all right and I will do everything I can to attend. 
 What is it about the two of you that you think I can't handle?  And believe me I am making efforts to enlist worthy participants. 
 Our regular Wednesday night crowd will be somewhat diminished.  However the most important individuals will be present...Us. 
 Who's picking on me?  I'll see what I can do but most of my girlfriends live in other cities and besides who wants to expend energy entertaining second string candidates? 
 I'm not going to take any lip from you.  The name is Little Woodrow's and it's on W. Alabama just off of Kirby. 
 Who all's going? 
 Say 7:30-7:45 and your on. 
 What kind of time frame are we looking at? 
 Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures. She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please let me know if you have any comments in this regard.  One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the conf. if El Paso does not want TW represented there.  ENA will probably be sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some intelligence from them. 
 For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive, and unlimited this month that you're capable of almost anything! (You've privately believed that the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This month, your incredible adaptability and powers of persuasion help you shed the status quo and break out of the corral. Unless you catch your foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and provoke others to investigate things they may have taken for granted. Speak up during the first week, especially if it's to announce you're starting a new venture. Business travel is likely during the first and third weeks, especially if contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is actually enjoyable this month and can open your eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've dragged your tin cup across the bars long enough. I smell a prison break. . . . 
 AQUARIUS  For April 17-23: Travel plans shape up and morph into much more. Every step you take seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities -- especially lately. The old rules don't apply anymore. The idea of signing up for something and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit an innovator like you. Your developing success will beget an avalanche of more success. Have your bags packed in preparation for spur of the moment opportunities and travel necessities. Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big way. You want to know more and experience life on a richer level. You're not the same person you were even a year ago. You understand more about yourself. Be open to travel, moving, advanced training, and additional contact with media and publishing. The word is out, Aquarius -- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the mail. . . . 
 You know me...any excuse to celebrate.  Name a time and place...amazingly my calendar appears to be open tomorrow night. 
 Congratulations and yes you did.  I of course will be sad to see you go but= I=20 know this is something you really wanted and therefore I can be nothing but= =20 pleased for you.

 I obviously didn't get up this morning to work-out...So I was wondering if you wanted to go for a run before Felicity tonight.  I should be home by 6:30 or 7:00.  Let me know. 
 I was remiss in excluding y'all from the original distribution.  Please=20 except my apologies. 
 Just found out from Minal that you guys are going to Osteria D'Aldo for your shower.  I hope you have a wonderful time but I have to warn you that the wine selection is extensive and the food is fantastic (although not very low-cal).  I know you're in the final stretch of the bet, however this just might be cause for a loss.  Bon Appetit!

 " To dream anything that you want to dream - that is the beauty of the human mind.  To do anything you want to do - that is the strength of the human will.

This is the meaning of success."   -Ralph Waldo Emerson 
 Don't you mean no more. 
 Thanks, Maria, this is very helpful.  I'm planning on drafting something this week for everyone's review.  Don't know if any other pipelines have tried to do anything similar but I'll find out. 
 Here's the answer to your question regarding 28.  The depth and complexity are overwhelming.

 Sorry for the delayed response, I got really busy Friday afternoon and didn't check my email before I left. 
 I'm there. 
 I love this one.  To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits of your passion and learned your place in the world.  -- George Santayana 
 Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments? Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of? 
 This was one of the emails I told you about. 
 Quite good.  They definitely provide a chuckle. 
 So Burton hits me with "I hear you drink like a fish.  Supposedly you were slamming them back last night."  When I asked where he garnered such information he told me "From our friend on 28."  I promptly sent the following message "Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with that I drink like a fish?"  Result, no response to me but he called Burton to lambast him for ratting him out.  And the eternal question remains, if no longer interested why care so much? 
 Please include me on the volunteer e-mail list. 
 I literally had tears in my eyes reading this one.  It sounded like a possible Santamaria outing. Enron North America Corp. 
 That was amazing. 
 Not quite as enlightening as the last email, but much funnier. 
  - The Paradox of Our Time.doc - jschoene.vcf 
 Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before inviting people.  First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:  - imbalance netting & trading - mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators - hourly determination of imbalances  Is this correct?  Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?  As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and I'll get it set up. 
 Just wanted to share this thought with all of you.  - The Paradox of Our Time.doc - jschoene.vcf  It is because of nights like last night with company such as yours that I remain optimistic in the face of statements such as the one attached. 
 Sorry, I forgot to include you in the last email.  Hope to see you tonight. 
 Wilson, my most heartfelt apologies.  I failed to include you on the last email (huge oversite on my part). 
 Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine. Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing. Cheers. 
 Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little Woodrow's tonight.  I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet, but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as early as possible.  Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen. 
 With the exception of Sunil no one answered the original question (Do we want to go somewhere we can eat?).  Given that the three of you sit within inches of each other, I'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me. Anything's OK with me so just let me know what you come up with.   If you get stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions. 
 Is there actually a fun sushi place?  And do they have Ichiban beer? 
 Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.  I think the first order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.  Depending on everyone's preferences I have several suggestions.  Let me know your thoughts (regarding tonight). 
 The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he does believe in a power higher than himself.  As for myself...  I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that I never know what I will discover day-to-day.  As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.  My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope for more). * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.  Given all of this I am very happy. 
 With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract.  In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an "as amended" basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract.

 Mark,  Thanks for still including me in the distribution,  it makes me feel important.  However, as I have moved out of the controls group it probably isn't necessary to include me any longer. 
 I possesed many of the items featured in this email, but my favorite by far was the one featured in the final frame.  I was a super-hero in the universe other wise known as my backyard. 
 As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.  If that is not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level of intelligence I had previously afforded you.  However, as I hate having my illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just give you the number...ext. 31455.

 Richard, you can remove my name from the distribution list as I have rotated to a new group and am no longer working in the controls group.  Thank you. 
 I think I had too much nectar last night. 
 Just wanted to let you know that the Richardson deal has been entered into TAGG.  The deal number is NE2760.

 Wilson, I treasure your NY attitude.  I think part of the reason you find so few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced either.  I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience. 
 It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified what constitutes a "good" girl.  And, given that oversight I may have been remiss in stating that Wilson was not ready for said good girl.  Just as the opinion of women in Texas differed between you Yanks and the Texas boys at the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a "good" girl may not be in line.   P.S. -- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.  (We really should have figured that one out last night.) 
 Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a draft to send around to the usual suspects.  1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs of the acquired capacity.  -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to other shippers. - Net costs will be separately recorded.  2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the "no tying" part).  3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity.  4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal. - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of TW.  5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing open access operations?  - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's tariff. - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on TW's system. - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios.  6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities?  - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently. 
 I am somewhat frightened that you would allow yourself to be referred to as MaximMan.  While I realize you are a fan of the magazine, professing so too loudly may hinder your efforts with the ladies (some of us do have a shread of dignity, which that periodical in particular attempts to tear away).  My advice is keep it in the closet or bathroom or where ever it comes in most "handy". 
 Are you experiencing some sort of split personality today?  Should I start referring to you as Ben or MaximMan depending on your responses? 
 "In an age when cloying, dumbed-down Internet "chat" threatens to reduce discourse to the linguistic equivalent of casual Fridays, men's-room vernacular is seeping alarmingly past its Pine Sol perimeter, infecting what is left of conversational civility.  Well-articulated sublimation--which has produced some damned fine (and sexy) art, music, and literature over the millennia--is no longer the default mode of expression.   That ageless Hot Boy, Michelangelo's David, could only have been produced through deft restraint.  But try telling that to some WWF instant Adonis with a protein-supplement habit."  --Gerri Hirshey 
 The Pub code has been changed to IF-ELPO/SJ.  Sorry for the mix-up.

 You crack me up.  I was going to email you today and tell you about the Bruce Cockburn concert.  I am definitely interested.  Don't know what I'm doing this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something. Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how much.  I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check it out.  Also, do you have Ray Wylie Hubbard's Crusades of the Restless Knights?  Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good.  Sorry so short with the email.  Even though they may be short I should be able to email throughout the day.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 The scary thing is I don't think he was kidding.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Thanks.  Lindy and I are going to look at whether any changes will need to be made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you. 
 Something to keep in mind:  Since FERC has implied that it considers shipper support in determining whether to allow pipelines to hold capacity on other pipelines, the more shippers we can get to intervene in our filing, the better. 
 Hey, just wondering how your weekend of golf went.  Wouldn't want to be accused of cutting off contact again.  P.S. -- I got a very interesting response from Plauche following the mass email...he is definitely a different chap. 
 You must have too much time on your hands.  The situation has been corrected. 
 You try and do something nice, keep people informed and involved and it just gets thrown back in your face.  That's okay though because, "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and dog-gonnit people like me." 
 You're off. 
 Sorry I've been MIA this week...new job and all.  Thought you might get a kick out of this email.  It's from that guy that is 25 but looks about 40. And yet he resurfaces again (read the email at the bottom first then his).  Yes I will be attending the Taster's dinner this evening.  Look forward to seeing you there. 
 Aren't we a poor sport. 
 Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.  On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00. 
 Here are my comments, spice girl. 
 You can take me off of the email distribution for FX exposures also.  Thanks. 
 Remember those previous discussions about relaxation?  You know me well enough to know that I am not easily offended, and in fact have thoroughly enjoyed the preceding banter.  Still, I do appreciate your remembering that I am a lady. (I have a bad habit of forgetting.) 
 Yes, it was. 
 It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly and enthusiastically.  (Tobin, you should watch how quickly you respond.) 
 It was not meant as an implication, but rather a reiteration of mind-sets expressed to me on multiple occasions.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 The views expressed below are not those of Enron Corp. or any of it's subsidiaries. 
 Dart, you can take me off the email distribution list now that I've left the risk controls group.  Thanks. 
 ...because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and dog-gonnit people like me. 
 The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.) 
 Okay, that was really good. 
 Jen, you have no idea how appropriate that email was for me this morning.  I spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on that.  I got to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington this weekend on the big screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.  And, Emily, Katy and myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally.  We met the three cutest, nicest real cowboys there.  It renewed my faith in the opposite sex. 
 No wanting to incur the wrath of Jen for failing to keep you informed.  Monte Montgomery will be playing at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge May 6. Hopefully, we can make this one. 
 Supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so I should be back in the world of reachable individuals next week.  I'm glad you appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.  I was afraid after two weeks of silence I may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that last email would have probably been the final nail in the coffin.  As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.  Turns out my trader went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.  Even without the connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my learning all I can about his book.  Hopefully, after I get the daily routine down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.  You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).  I hope things are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.  If that is the case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate your current position in life.  Believe me over the last two months I have had ample opportunity to do just that.  Just let me know if I can return the favour you once did for me.  Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.  P.S.  How was Canada?  I heard through the grapevine you went the other weekend. 
 Do you honestly think Tobin can be a substitute for you? 
 Main Entry: al?tru?ism Pronunciation: 'al-tru-"i-z&m Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter Date: 1853 1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others  We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him by consuming so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your typical response to this is "I am the most altruistic person."  I am sure you recognize the hypocrisy laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes only that his acts benefit those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to "concerned individual".  But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, extremely unselfish young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C. The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of the Century list, and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..  FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both receive my next brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of appearances. 
 Hugo, you can go ahead and remove me from the distribution list as I have moved out of the controls group.  Good luck with everything, it has been great working with you.

 After reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they all used to be?  I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email could have.  They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.  I really don't know what to say about the email.  If I didn't know what happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just confused.  I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send it to him in a heartbeat.  But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.  I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email dialogue throughout the day. 
 In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.  This Friday at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one evening.  Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such an outing.  "And in the end it's not the years in your life that count.  It's the life in your years."  - - Abraham Lincoln 
 Sorry Toby, but honestly this is the first time I've seen such a request. A lot of things get sent to Susan Scott of ECT by mistake; maybe that is what happened? I would never ignore you on purpose. I'll call Ms. Lee and give her the correct info. 
 See especially pages 5 & 6 of the attached doc., which include the argument that existing ROFR should not be grandfathered.  Please send any comments you have to me.  Thanks!! 
 Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day. Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several days a week, for sanity's sake.  Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called "Fucking A."  It was a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown. (Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.  Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the drum all day.  Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!  Love, Susan 
 Thanks Dennis.  Do you have the form of discount letter too?  If so, please send it. 
 The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from day to day. The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.  My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 months.  If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it. Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it last December. 
 Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook  1.  "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED" adds a note of authority to your pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading into the special incinerator marked "Nonconforming Pleadings" (located on the west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.  2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of the party will appear several times in one sentence.  3.  The verb "request" may not be used without the word "to."  Example: "Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion."  4.  "In regards to" or "vis-a-via" sound more intelligent than "about" or "concerning."  5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the provision once.  6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.  7.  When in doubt, insert more commas.
