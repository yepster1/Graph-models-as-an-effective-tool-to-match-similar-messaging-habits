t card payments. Details on the option are included in the Form 4868 instructions.  By making the extension request, the IRS will automatically give you four more months, until Aug. 15, to file your return.  You can get an extension for any reason. No explanation is asked for when requesting an extension.  But be aware that your extension request only gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty charges, you must estimate how much you owe and make the payment with your extension request by the April 16 deadline.  Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax bill, you should at least file an extension request by the April 16 deadline.  Though you'll be subject to interest and possible penalty charges for late payment of your taxes, you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a maximum 25 percent.)  Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay your balance due in monthly installments. You make the request for an installment agreement when you file your completed tax return using Form 9465, "Installment Agreement Request."  "Offer in compromise": If you can't afford to pay all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a period of years, you may be able to work out a settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded its "Offer in Compromise" program, in which taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using IRS Form 656, "Offer in Compromise."  A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all you need is an extra month or so to come up with the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you may be able to get a short reprieve without being subject to interest or penalties.  All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to calculate your tax bill for you.  If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be assessed any penalties or interest.  To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable income must be less than $100,000 and you can't itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained in IRS Publication 967, "The IRS Will Figure Your Tax."  Retirement account contributions: If you hope to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension.  The deadline is more flexible for self-employed retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be made up until the due date of your return, which can be later than April 16 with a filing extension.  Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers and other individuals who need to make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 16 also is the deadline for making the first installment for 2001.
