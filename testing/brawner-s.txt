 Hello Chance,  I have no idea what you are referring to.

 Big Smile -  Well I guess if I had to be honest he is unique in the market place.   I found him very interesting and confusing all at the same time. It would be nice to have a beer one day and catch up on old times.  Take care

 You put a smile on my face with your message.... The reading material is no big deal - It is some Gas Rags story about Skillings comments. And your customer is completly happy with her trim - However , She (me) wants to be a regular client. 
 Hello Kenny,  Just a couple of things.  One our stock is up again today  now it is up 2 at 62$  I was wondering if we should sell some?  What is your opinion. Also I have some reading for you tonight - The Skiliing Story is all over the Gas Market.  (I told Ya).  I know that Clayton has soccer tonight - dont worry about dinner , I would actually prefer some of that Turkey tonight.  I love you 
 Thank you for your comments. 
 I have no idea what this e-mail is suppose to mean to me? 
 Louise,  Sempra Energy has called and asked to "cover' outstanding positions with Enron. They have done some deals with me this morning via EOL, as well as a "sleeve" with EPNG in order to minimize their exposure with us.  Indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well,  I advised them to call the respected traders first, as apposed to calling voice brokers,  to see what they can facilitate. 
 Scott,  Just a quick note.  I believe you did a great job this afternoon in communicating with your group about Enron's "cluster." Today I have found this overwhelming since of Pride for this company and I don't want it to fail.  So if there is ANYTHING I can do to help please let me know.  I am in for the challenge and the long haul.   Sincerely, Sandra 
 I believe 1. 
  I had mentioned to you last night that I would forward you the memo I sent my CEO of Enron yesterday. Today seems better here, not so much anger around the trade floor.    This is our BID Week so we have alot of business to take care of.  And as of  9:11 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 1st time in weeks.  Hopefully,  we can close ont he Highs. 
 As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not begin to explain the pit in my stomach.  I have been an employee of Enron since June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions and or ask direct questions. I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catastrophe are still employed.  And I guess I need to understand why?  FIRED THEM !   It is apparent to me  that the information we have given to the market place is not sufficient enough.  "THEY" don't trust us anymore.  Get a plan of action, attack it, and save this company. 
 Where do I begin?  I guess I could start with several excuses or reasons to justify my behavior on Friday, but the truth is there aren't any.  I only am left with total humiliation and embarrassment for my actions, words, and behavior.  Please accept my sincere apology.  Sandra 
  I thought you would like this 
 sure no problem - but I dont have any idea as to who I am interviewing or where I am suppose to go.  WIll this information follow later? 
 Colleen, I think you will find this very interesting. 
 When are you going to call Kenny and have him help you walk through getting Instant messanger  - you will love it _ I promise 
 Why are you so cranky?  Anything I can do?   Hey I spoke to my friend (mike) and told him about you and Jon - you know all the good stuff, how nice you guys are, what good friends we have become, that you all live in Greatwood (like they do), that you guys have a 2 year old son (like they do), that your families are all up North (like thiers are)  and he want the six of us to have dinner so he and his wife can get to know you and JOn ...Interested? 
 Hi pick up it is me on the phone 
  Now this is postive thoughts.   This is thinking the glass is half full.  I wish I were more like this.  Life would be so refreshing if we all stopped whinning and looked at life this away....  I miss you, call me 
 Yes Susan sounds good to me.  let me know - and I would advise you to double check with Brennans to make sure they do still shuttle. 
 Thanks, this gave me a nice chuckle this morning.   I wish I had the nerve to send it to John Mckay , but i dont.
