dont understnd your response?  Are you talking about the retreat? 
 sounds great - but i am too conservative.  That is alot of $$ for three days.  And it is close to x-mas.   Sorry - maybe later in the year? I had a nice time at Bens party.  Thank you for being you. 
 i dont get it 
 Steve - will you call me, when you get a moment> 
 Steve,  My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that Matt and Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I do not believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to do business with Natsourse today or in the future. 
 I have received your E-Mail .  Steve,  I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.  You need to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas Dailys.   Thank You 
 I have received your e-mail.  Thank you for your thoughts. 
 I have received your E-Mail. 
 Great!  I am glad that your trip is postponed - then we will be able to get together.  Call me or write when you get thoses details. Looking forward to your visit.   Sandra 
 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you .  My mom had some surgery last week and I was in and out of the office.  Thursday the 21st is not good for me. Kenny is going hunting (birds)  and I will need to be available for the children.  Let me know if there is another evening that will work> 
 How are you today ?   Must be busy, I havn't heard form you much.   I am bored. 
 Hello Bill,  It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference there.  Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though. Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these days.  Lunch is out of the question.  So we are looking at drinks or dinner. the week of the 20th is better.  The week of the 25th is not going to be easy cuz it is settlement week.  Pam is doing fine.  Still looking for a job.  Hopefully something will happen soon.  She had mentioned that you wrote a note,  I guess I got the impression she had replied.  She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in her life so just give her some time. 
 All is fine with one exception.  Do not set up a product for the columbia mainline     Thanks
