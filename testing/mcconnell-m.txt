few minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP. Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential. This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive statement about your business as an intro line of the section.  Thanks, mike 
 Mary, I would say a couple of things.  I describe Enron's unique culture using adjectives like , empowerment, innovation, innovation on steroids, high energy, exciting, challenging, cool, a great place to work.  Each one of these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement.  I hope this is what you were looking for. Mike 
 CP, please forward quote to JDF for their consideration. mike 
 It looks fine. Thanks, mike 
 Mike McConnell has asked me to respond to your message on his behalf.  He has asked that you please contact George Wasaff with Enron for this conference. Mr. Wasaff is the Managing Director for Strategic Sourcing.  He recently spoke at one of your conferences and this conference is more closely related to Mr. Wasaff's area of responsibility.  Thank you for your assistance.  Cathy Phillips for Mike McConnell 
 Hi Paula -  Mike McConnell has again asked me to send you a message on his behalf.  We have received your message below to Zina and then also a message from Carrie Shapiro on the same conference.  George Wasaff, MD for Strategic Sourcing, spoke at one of these conferences recently and Mike said that he would like to have the conference organizers continue to contact George for future conferences.  I will pass this information along to both Zina and Carrie.  Again, let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips for Mike McConnell (713) 853-6898 
 Jeannie,  Thanks for asking about my dad, he is doing very well after surgery which we believe was successful.  My kids loved it.  The really enjoyed learning about Dad's work and what I do.  I think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much time here at Enron.  I have two children Claire - 9  and Michael - 6. They both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the actual day.  Actually my daughter talks about it all year long.  Also they really can identify with Enron and talk more about it because of events like these.  Mike 
 Jay,  Howdy from Houston.  I bet it is cooler in NY.  I don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except I changed the word "his" to "the" investment group.  As far as other clarification of duties, I don't have any issue with it, but every CEO will call me and ask if this is a change in how they deal with Alan or investments.  What is the status with Steve and how the group is organized?  Did you talk with him and let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration?  Is that your official assigned work number?  If not, we need to get one assigned before the email goes out.  Also, I am assuming that this is in the MG office not the small Enron office, is that accurate?  Greg and I both think that the MG office is the best location and will help them assimilate with Enron.  Thanks, Mike  PS, good luck in the move 
 Greg,=20  FYI,  This is a draft org announcement to clarify Jay's and now Alan's role= . =20 We have discussed this before but I think this is important to send out and= =20 officially address.  It is intentionally very brief and informs people of t= he=20 new situation.  Please let me know if you have any comments,  I would like = to=20 send out this week.  Thanks, Mike =20    At Enron Net Works, it has become clear that we have a tremendous opportuni= ty=20 to utilize our unique strengths, skills and new business efforts across an= =20 entire new set of opportunities being created in the private equity markets= . =20 Because of this, we have reorganized the Enron Net Works Investments Group= =20 with the view to leveraging the group better across strategic opportunities= =20 in the eCommerce and technology space, and within Enron.  Effective immediately, Jay Fitzgerald will take responsibility for setting= =20 ENW=01,s investment strategy and the implementation of that strategy.  Repo= rting=20 to him in this new role will be Steve Horn and the venture investing group.= =20 Further, Alan Sommer will be joining Jay=01,s team to focus on developing n= ew=20 market opportunities, with a focus on working with the various domestic and= =20 international Enron business units to develop eCommerce-related businesses= =20 and strategies.  Jay will be relocating to New York city and will be working both out of the= =20 New York and Houston offices in his new role, and can be reached at=20 jay@enron.com or by phone at either (212) 702-3934 or (713) 853-9914. 
 Jay,  I like it.  Two questions. 1. You didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups, specifically, EEL, ENA will (may) be different than how it works (and approves) investments with the investments from the other business groups. 2.  You still called it Steve's group.  Do you want to address the issue more directly or leave it more ambiguous?  What are your thoughts? mike 
 Here is a draft of the Jay announcement.  What do you think? mike 
 Its on my calendar. m 
 Market size is in the presentation, thanks.  I want you to pick the number you want me to reference as our potential market share target and a potential margin number extrapolated from that.  Please respond ASAP with what you feel comfortable with.  Thanks, mike 
 John,  We have discussed i2 in the past  but we need to take some action steps to make decisions and move forward.  Here is what I want to see done in short order.  Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and functionality with complete demonstration by i2.  I would especially want PB, JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group. Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders:  GP -  P&P; TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel;  JF - New Markets and Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev.  During that meeting, we need to have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business expansion opportunities in the specific verticals.  It would be good to actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance.  i2 owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts and solve any logistic issues. Put together an action plan.  George's group has already put a presentation together about i2, the products and possible applications.  George, please sent that to John.  I would like that document to be our updated business plan for i2 to be used as a "living" document as we move forward. Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those products (utilize our $10 million spend).  I want someone to have the responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are doing also.  To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not using the products.  I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this investment fully utilized.  I do understand that we don't drive businesses around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an option. Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives.  He would be the guy to work with and set it all up. EBS should be involved as well.  Rex Shelby is spending a lot of time with i2, weekly visits, and should also participate and use their products as well. Is there an application for all of EES and their business? Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works. PB, if you want someone outside Pavetto's group  to work on this that is fine but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen.   Thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing.  If you need to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the priority, please draft up and I'll send out.  Mike 
 Jeff,  FYI, I just got this from Tom.  We don't have a very big opportunity here! Tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.  Not that i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should put as market size?  Nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?  What do you think?  He is the only one to give me a number yet.  I am going to discuss it at the staff meeting.  Mike 
 Steve,  Thanks for the voicemail.  I was surprised that you were not up to speed (although I probably shouldn't be).  Please talk with Joe and get is view on this.  I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.  Certainly he wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help with that.  Let me know if you get any other news.  Thanks, Mike 
 Richard, Life does move on!   What is Malcomb thinking!  Can you imagine intentionally working for and believing in Jonathan Legg?  Hope all is well.  Mike 
 Thank you for the email.  I have forwarded it on for people's consideration.  Mike McConnell 
 Lisa,  I am now catching up with some old emails (I've been out of the country for quite some time).  What is the status on this.  What  got approved and how much?  Do we still need more for Ted?  Mike McConnell 
 CP, would you please follow up and get the right forms to fill out.  I will= =20 give my $5k. thanks, mike 
 Thanks, m 
 Gary,  Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.  I don't think that I sent this to you when I got it.  If I did please ignore this.  D'Arcy Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.  D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.  Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.  He knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.  Mike 
 Steve,  FYI, here was my response to Michael.  I was surprised that you didn't know about this but i probably shouldn't have been.  Let me know if you have a different opinion.  Mike 
 Mike,  I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.  My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time. I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.  Thanks, Mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 Mike, I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able to talk.  How about Friday @ 10am? Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a direction.  I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.  Thanks, Mike 
 I am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking place July 24-26.  Enron Net Works is being featured and as part of the overall story Skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses (and a few other possible verticals and market places).  Please provide me with these 3 specific items of information.  1.  Total market size for your business:  e.g.  Pulp and Paper is approx. $300 billion. 2.  Your target market share of that total 3.  Targeted (or other comparable) margin that you would (or could) expect to see  I realize this is subjective but I do need an answer to all 3 questions.  Put any explanation that you feel is important or needed.  Also please quote the source of the global market size.  When I get all the information, I'll go through it with everyone.  We  also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering moving into and if you know any of these below, please let me know.  Data storage Grains Petrochemicals Steel Logistics  Thank you for your quick response.  Mike 
 Cate,  I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem? Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as well.  Mike McConnell 
 please set up a time for us to meet.  meet only.  please put him in front of some meeting so it cant go on to long. thanks, m 
 FYI, please forward as you feel might be the best fit for consideration. mike 
 Thank your email.  I am forwarding it on to Robert Jones, VP of HR for the Net Works group and he will make sure that it gets wide distribution for possible positions.  Mike McConnell 
 Steve,  Here is an email from Mike.  Are you up to speed on this?  What do you think?  Please provide some quick feedback via email.  Thanks, mike 
 Lisa,  As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized that I forgot to talk about 2 people,  including regulatory and your personal efforts.  I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.  I could not read my notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on my notes just on me.  Thanks, Mike 
 Guy, FYI.  Is anyone familiar with this?  Mike is looking for some feedback. It looks very premature and not worth a lot of time but he may need us to talk with them to help him with his business down there.  Any comments?  Mike 
 FYI.  I got this from mike late last week.  Any comments?  It looks very early in their development but Mike may want them to talk to a couple of people here about their site.  We need to be helpful if it will help his business.  Dan are you up to speed on this?  If not please call him and get his viewpoint as well.  Mike 
 Rebecca, Ouch.  Thanks checking, sorry for being out of the loop.  I'll let Philippe know, although he should have already been aware of this.  Mike 
 I don't think you got a copy of this. mike  Andrew, please make sure Jeff gets a copy of all of everything.  He is the Office of the Chairman sponor of the vertical and will be managing this process with Greg Piper until launch.  I stepped in while he was out of town on holiday. 
 They look fine to me.  There is a lot there - not.  I know that is the plan, i'm kidding. mike 
 Rebecca,  Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.  Can we make this happen and when would it occur?  Thanks, Mike 
 Mike, Thanks for the response.  Yes, I would like a complete review of your initiatives.  Please call Cathy at 36898 and get on my calendar for a 1 hour update.  Thanks, mike 
 Mark, as discussed this morning.  When does Cedric get back?  I can go=20 through them in more detail but I thought these would help. mike 
 Cedric, =20  As a follow-up to our meeting,  below are a few comments and ideas regardin= g=20 the Net Works piece of the analyst presentation. =20  I know I sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages in= =20 the various presentations that I think may be appropriate for the=20 presentation (or pieces of them) including:=20  ? Why Enron? ? Recent Enron eCommerce Experience ? Lessons Learned ? Business Strategy ? Target Market Criteria ? Enron Today/Enron Tomorrow  Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.  We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business=20 (obvious).  Clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst=20 meetings.  This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm=20 (eventually).  Especially with Jeff=01,s comments with the analysts.  This= =20 should be emphasized with the metals piece.  The concept is that here are 2= =20 new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses and= =20 industries.  Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than= =20 all the other 15 existing sites.  All of the others are charging 3% fees fo= r=20 matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of=20 transactions. We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $= 0=20 (we=01,ll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pri= cing=20 component (this piece will be free).  This piece will not be ready for July= =20 25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (should= =20 be out by end of 3rd qtr.).  I believe that the link with Net Works with bo= th=20 paper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture th= an=20 just metals alone.  Also for your information, we are working on 2=20 acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and coul= d=20 be announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since = we=20 will have access to physical pulp and paper.  Paper must be an important=20 piece of the presentation.  Greg Piper is the MD for Clickpaper and he can= =20 answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.  He c= an=20 be reached at ext. 36635.  Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder;  put Lumber underneath= =20 pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. = =20 That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others are= =20 in "incubation" and examination stages.=20  Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest= =20 version and I=01,ll add additional commentary.  I will be in all next week.  Thanks, mike 
 Bob and I are still playing phone tag, but he's calling.  Call being scheduled for Wednesday it appears. m 
 Cathy would you please review daily for updates and make the changes on a running list.  I'll read for info only and you can update them.  After I read them and waiting 1 day, I'll delete from the system. thanks, mike 
 Thanks. m    Enron North America Corp. 
 Monica, This looks ok, but I can give you more accurate and more up to date slides for the future.  One important fact, we do not distibute the EOL slides to the general public.  Normally what we do is present the story but do not include hard copies with the conference hand outs.  mike 
 Greg,  FYI.  I'll give you a full update on Monday afternoon via voicemail.  We are on our way. m 
 Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.  I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon. Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective?  A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.  mike 
 Attached is the first draft of the eCommerce Commercial and Origination Activities Contact List.  This is being prepared for a wider distribution, therefore, please take a moment to review the list carefully and let me know if you have any changes to the list or if you would like to add any additional names to the list that you feel are appropriate.  The purpose of this document is to provide a consistent means for all areas of Enron to direct questions and inquiries related to specific eCommerce issues.  Thank you.  Mike McConnell 
 Ted, Thanks for the email.  It looks like bad luck again for lunch.  I am out of town again.  Life is crazy right now.  Look for more on Enron and Enron Net Works in the near future.  We are busy.  Thanks and i hope all is well. mike 
 thanks for the follow-up mike 
 Don,  Thanks for the fax survey.  We couldn't read the numbers however.  Please mail a copy to our house when you get a chance.  Are there any issues from your point of view?  I would like to understand what the limitations are on the easements but it appears that everything is done.  Are we ready to close and how do we do this? Thanks, Mike 
 Thanks, I'll keep my ears open. mike 
 Please distribute the following message to Enron - Worldwide and please use the Office of the Chairman - Enron Net Works letterhead.  Mike McConnell has requested that this message be returned for final review and then sent to Enron - Worldwide this evening.  Please call me at X-36898 if you have any questions.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips   Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, managing director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice president and chief accounting officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.   We believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating new electronic market places. 
 Rick, here is the proposed email on George.  Any comments?  I wanted to keep it short and sweet.  This will be sent out at close of business today (they like to send out massive emails after hours).  Pleaes let me know any issues or comments ASAP.

 I hope some of these help.  They are similar in nature but may have different pieces inlcuded in them.  I recommend flipping through them quickly and eliminate extras or ones that you don't need.  Call me if you need anything else.  mike 
 By the way, I still couldn't open this. m 
 I think he is an excellent choice if he has time.  Will he have help? m    Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks and have a great holiday. m 
 I'm fine with it. mike 
 By the way, good calls. m 
 Pam, I'm following up on a few old items.  Did you get what you needed here?  I was in Asia when I originally got this and didn't hear anything back on this.  Thanks, mike 
 Allan, Please call Fred and discuss.  Thanks, mike 
 PB,  I just talked with Cindy Olsen about the project.  We need to assign someone in our group to be the technology lead.  I know we have people on it but we need to pick someone to be responsible and then  clarify that person's role. Please get back to me with the selection.  Thanks, mike 
 John,  Howdy from Houston.  I received a call from a guy named Steve Scott who is involved with several ventures including a German VC  called eStreet.  Are you aware of these guys?  They want to talk to someone about e-opportunties in Europe especially Spain.  I will ask  him to call you once I talk with him but I don't have your number in London.  Two questions, what is your  phone number in London (the phone book has you in Germany) and do you know these guys?  Thanks, Mike 
 The purpose of this email is to highlight a few points and action items tha= t=20 were emphasized during my recent trips to South America, Japan and Korea. = =20 Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n= ow=20 truly gets the ENW story and what we are attempting to accomplish.

 Mike McConnell plans to attend the meeting at 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 25th.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips for Mike McConnell 
 Mike, I am totally booked today and am physically out of our office most of the day.  Cathy has attempted to coordinate and has set him up to talk with a couple of other senior people in New Works and technology.  She will know if my schedules changes and I become available.  Sorry it couldn't work out.  mike 
 Any update?  How did the interview go? m 
 Wade, I had a good discussion with Hemant.  I am in full support of his position as a VP at Enron.  Mike 
 Philippe, I don't really understand this guys question.   I need to respond to him with something because I know his dad very well via JDF.  Ross Cooley was Rod Canions #2 guy at compaq for years.  Can you send me to the right person? Thanks, Mike 
 Now you know we don't have the room! mike 
 Thanks for your help.  We got in and its working fine. mike 
 Joe,  Thanks for the response.  As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.  I am writing this from my bed and I am improving.  I should be able to get on the plane tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will be fine).  I'm definitely in recovery mode.  I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.  I know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, especially if i am still a little under the weather.  I still don't want to have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process.  Sorry if it is a pain but I think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that I will have assistance.  Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon.  Mike McConnell 
 I'll let you know later.  thanks, m 
 Julie, looks great.  Please make sure the video is also in there.  I'm doing better but very week.  Ready to try food.  If I am at all better i will get on the plane tomorow.  Yolanda is going to messanger a bunch of stuff to my house later, just make sure she gets the CD. Thanks, m 
 Joe,  Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the trip?  Remember,  I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities.  A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  Also, what is the appropriate dress code.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  I normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language. If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.  One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture.  Thanks, Mike 
 Julie, thanks for the update.  Please add one more change i noticed.  Please add Managing Director & CTO to Philippe on the org. chart.  Also send next draft and final to Jeff McMahon and Greg Whalley.  thanks, m 
 PB,  Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  I figured you might need someone like this around for Paveto,  Bruce's or in EOL group.   He would pound the phones and make things happen.  Follow up if you want to talk with him.  Thanks, m 
 I look forward to it. m 
 Richard, Right now I'm scheduled to be out of the country.  When you come in, call Cathy (3-6898) and see if it will work. Mike 
 Philippe,  I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore. How much will it really save?  Those numbers a long with all the other points might bring clarity to what we should do.  Thanks, Mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  FYI,  Mike 
 Mary Nell and Peter,  I certainly agree.  I don't know if Jeff has called Mulva but that is the right action before we do anything else.  John will hear the result of that conversation as soon as it happens.  Thanks and good luck. Mike  Mike 
 Cp, please set up 15 minutes some time in July.  thanks, mike 
 Blake, Thanks for the email.  I will work on it.  I am out for the next several weeks, S America (today), Korea and Japan in the next 2 weeks.  If I don't follow-up after that, please email me again.  Thanks for the kind words. mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 Bob, Hello from S America.  I would recommend 2 people.  Both are obvious but Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.  If they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.  Mike 
 PB, what do you think? m 
 CP, Please fill in my meetings on my calendar as we normally do. thanks, m 
 Steve,  Thanks for the update.  I was stunned by your email and didn't know about your father.  I am very sorry for your loss.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.  Mike 
 Chris,  Thanks for the email.  I'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely help.  I miss understood about the photos, I thought you were sending me via email that next day.   Congrats on the Cassatt, that person will really enjoy it.  Let me know about the price as soon as you get a chance.  I understand that there is a shipping component and no sales tax.  I like to have all my art shipped because the tax savings can be significant, especially in New York. I did like that frame on the picture but didn't understand your comment below ($783).  The price you had did include the frame didn't it?  Thanks, Mike 
 Thanks for the quick response.  I sent it on to John.  Don't be surprised if he calls you;  you are the master of this deal.  Mike 
 John,  Below is a response from Richard Harper.  A couple of interesting thoughts. Richard would be a great source for running ideas by and/or  testing concepts.  He is brilliant on this. Just a thought.  Mike 
 Inja, Hello from South America. =20 By way of this email I will ask Cathy Phillips to send you a bio and pictur= e=20 as requested.  I will present the Net Works story and EOL in a presentation= =20 if they would like.  The EOL presentation and statistics are very cool.  I= =20 don't have a lot to send them in advance but you can say that ENW is changi= ng=20 everything on our new approach to business and it will be huge.  Let me kno= w=20 if there is something else that I can do.  Thanks, mike=20 
 Julie, thanks for the update.  a couple of items. 1.  take out IT compliance and we will make it 1 dot point under PB's area of technology update 2. metals - call it MG(plc) 3.  take out page 16 (initiatives under consideration) 4.  Change org chart;  Jay - add investments and New Mkt. identification; take S horn off 5. on agenda page add sub dots for project updates and accomplishments under technology update 6. Jeff McMahon will add a page on finance as well, give him a call for a draft.  It will go in the vision section put it toward the back of the vision section  On further emails, only send me change or new pages.  It takes forever to download this (EOL) when I replicate.  Thanks, m 
 John,  Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.  I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.  Good luck, Mike 
 Richard, Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.  Amazing how the memory fades on some of the details in just a few years.  Mike 
 Suzanne,  I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good. Two comments: 1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly. 2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.  Good luck.  Your teams hard work really shows here.  mike 
 Jeff, FYI.  I will co-ordinate an executive dinner.  He is a great guy and a real player.  Sanjiv has asked Ken to be on the board and he is considering. I'll give more details later. Mike 
 FYI, mike 
 George, The URL didn't work, please leave me a voicemail on their next stepts. Have a good week. mike 
 Sounds like a plan.  Eric is the key to all your activities. m 
 Attached for your reference and commentary is a first draft of a contact list to assist in communication of our key efforts globally.  Please make any additions, changes (and/or corrections) that you believe are appropriate and return to my office for update and distribution.  The goal is not to list out everyone working on a project or business but to include a couple of players if someone needs information about how this could apply to their business.  Thanks, mike 
 FYI, mike 
 John,  Jeff and I had many excellent meetings with your team and received a very= =20 good run down of their businesses.

 I am Cathy Phillips, Mike McConnell's assistant and I am responding to your message of his behalf.  He has asked that I schedule the meeting as requested in your message below.  Please contact me at 713-853-6898 or cathy.phillips@enron.com and I will be happy to assist in anyway that I can.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips 
 Allan, Thanks, I'll add them to the list.  I would appreciate a self appraisal feedback form on yourself with your list of accomplishments to date.  (I know it is hard to put together when you've been here for as long as you have).   mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  Rick Bergsieker is the key here.  He can certainly direct you to the right people or others on his staff to help from Abu Dabai. Rick:  Houston ext:  66504 Abu Dabai:  9 714 331 8717  Mike 
 Kurt,  I agree with Eric.   California is very dangerous right now and we would need something very real to bring this to his attention.  Steve Kean  really liked the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll.  Mike 
 Chris,  Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.  I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up the email.  Thanks, Mike McConnell  PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary Cassat as a gift for her. 
 Joe,  As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.  When you get a chance to examine the EGM information and get your thoughts together, lets us know your views and your view of the best way forward.  We have everyone thinking about it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well.  It will help with Morten Erik as well.  Thanks, Mike 
 Morten Erik,  Thanks for the email.  I thought it was very thorough and hits all the main points that we are thinking about right now.  Jeff and I are very bullish on the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.  I believe that will also drive the structure.  You should have received an EGM overview yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our general direction.  I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.  We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&L but on transactions and growing the business.   I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.  I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.  It will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified in the mean time.  Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points tomorrow as well.  Thanks, Mike 
 Jeff,  FYI.  This is an excellent email and one that addresses all the issues we need to make decisions on.  Lets discuss because I have some views but am very open to others especially when I don't really know (first hand) what oppts really look like there.  We need to address quickly.  Mike 
 Richard,  I sent your info on to my direct reports for evaluation.  I've also sent on to others as well.  If there is an interest, you will be hearing from us.  Good luck, Mike 
 David,  Thanks for the email.  It did cause an interesting conversation without knowing what the situation was.  We all have very open relationships around here (it is why we are so successful as a company).  Please don't think twice about responding to Greg or any senior manager on an issue - but he would also have no issue with your response being cc back to Jeff and/or myself at the same time.  Thanks, Mike   PS;  we are all thinking about P+ constantly. 
 I would like to invite you and a guest to join me for the annual Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Gala to be held on May 12, 2001 at the Westin Galleria. The guest speaker this year will be General Norman Schwarzkof.  Please contact Cathy Phillips (X-36898) and let her know if you are interested in attending.  Thank you.  Mike

 This is fine with Mike McConnell. 
 Thanks for the response.  I found a beautiful Bonnard in London and NY.  I will be buying in next day or two.  Asking price is $9,500.  I will keep the Lautrecs in mind.  I think one is in my future - next.  I don't think I'll be buying one for a few months.  I'll get back to you.  Mike 
 Sorry, 3pm- 5+pm. m
