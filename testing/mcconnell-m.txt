 Mike McConnell plans to attend the meeting at 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 25th.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips for Mike McConnell 
 Mike, I am totally booked today and am physically out of our office most of the day.  Cathy has attempted to coordinate and has set him up to talk with a couple of other senior people in New Works and technology.  She will know if my schedules changes and I become available.  Sorry it couldn't work out.  mike 
 Wade, I had a good discussion with Hemant.  I am in full support of his position as a VP at Enron.  Mike 
 I look forward to it. m 
 Philippe, I don't really understand this guys question.   I need to respond to him with something because I know his dad very well via JDF.  Ross Cooley was Rod Canions #2 guy at compaq for years.  Can you send me to the right person? Thanks, Mike 
 Now you know we don't have the room! mike 
 Thanks for your help.  We got in and its working fine. mike 
 Joe,  Thanks for the response.  As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.  I am writing this from my bed and I am improving.  I should be able to get on the plane tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will be fine).  I'm definitely in recovery mode.  I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.  I know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, especially if i am still a little under the weather.  I still don't want to have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process.  Sorry if it is a pain but I think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that I will have assistance.  Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon.  Mike McConnell 
 I'll let you know later.  thanks, m 
 Julie, looks great.  Please make sure the video is also in there.  I'm doing better but very week.  Ready to try food.  If I am at all better i will get on the plane tomorow.  Yolanda is going to messanger a bunch of stuff to my house later, just make sure she gets the CD. Thanks, m 
 Joe,  Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the trip?  Remember,  I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities.  A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  Also, what is the appropriate dress code.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  I normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language. If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.  One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture.  Thanks, Mike 
 Julie, thanks for the update.  Please add one more change i noticed.  Please add Managing Director & CTO to Philippe on the org. chart.  Also send next draft and final to Jeff McMahon and Greg Whalley.  thanks, m 
 Richard, Right now I'm scheduled to be out of the country.  When you come in, call Cathy (3-6898) and see if it will work. Mike 
 PB,  Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  I figured you might need someone like this around for Paveto,  Bruce's or in EOL group.   He would pound the phones and make things happen.  Follow up if you want to talk with him.  Thanks, m 
 Chris,  Thanks for the email.  I'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely help.  I miss understood about the photos, I thought you were sending me via email that next day.   Congrats on the Cassatt, that person will really enjoy it.  Let me know about the price as soon as you get a chance.  I understand that there is a shipping component and no sales tax.  I like to have all my art shipped because the tax savings can be significant, especially in New York. I did like that frame on the picture but didn't understand your comment below ($783).  The price you had did include the frame didn't it?  Thanks, Mike 
 Philippe,  I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore. How much will it really save?  Those numbers a long with all the other points might bring clarity to what we should do.  Thanks, Mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  FYI,  Mike 
 Mary Nell and Peter,  I certainly agree.  I don't know if Jeff has called Mulva but that is the right action before we do anything else.  John will hear the result of that conversation as soon as it happens.  Thanks and good luck. Mike  Mike 
 Cp, please set up 15 minutes some time in July.  thanks, mike 
 Blake, Thanks for the email.  I will work on it.  I am out for the next several weeks, S America (today), Korea and Japan in the next 2 weeks.  If I don't follow-up after that, please email me again.  Thanks for the kind words. mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 Bob, Hello from S America.  I would recommend 2 people.  Both are obvious but Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.  If they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.  Mike 
 PB, what do you think? m 
 CP, Please fill in my meetings on my calendar as we normally do. thanks, m 
 Steve,  Thanks for the update.  I was stunned by your email and didn't know about your father.  I am very sorry for your loss.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.  Mike 
 Thanks for the quick response.  I sent it on to John.  Don't be surprised if he calls you;  you are the master of this deal.  Mike 
 Sounds like a plan.  Eric is the key to all your activities. m 
 John,  Below is a response from Richard Harper.  A couple of interesting thoughts. Richard would be a great source for running ideas by and/or  testing concepts.  He is brilliant on this. Just a thought.  Mike 
 Inja, Hello from South America. =20 By way of this email I will ask Cathy Phillips to send you a bio and pictur= e=20 as requested.  I will present the Net Works story and EOL in a presentation= =20 if they would like.  The EOL presentation and statistics are very cool.  I= =20 don't have a lot to send them in advance but you can say that ENW is changi= ng=20 everything on our new approach to business and it will be huge.  Let me kno= w=20 if there is something else that I can do.  Thanks, mike=20 
 Julie, thanks for the update.  a couple of items. 1.  take out IT compliance and we will make it 1 dot point under PB's area of technology update 2. metals - call it MG(plc) 3.  take out page 16 (initiatives under consideration) 4.  Change org chart;  Jay - add investments and New Mkt. identification; take S horn off 5. on agenda page add sub dots for project updates and accomplishments under technology update 6. Jeff McMahon will add a page on finance as well, give him a call for a draft.  It will go in the vision section put it toward the back of the vision section  On further emails, only send me change or new pages.  It takes forever to download this (EOL) when I replicate.  Thanks, m 
 John,  Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.  I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.  Good luck, Mike 
 Richard, Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.  Amazing how the memory fades on some of the details in just a few years.  Mike 
 Suzanne,  I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good. Two comments: 1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly. 2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.  Good luck.  Your teams hard work really shows here.  mike 
 Jeff, FYI.  I will co-ordinate an executive dinner.  He is a great guy and a real player.  Sanjiv has asked Ken to be on the board and he is considering. I'll give more details later. Mike 
 FYI, mike 
 George, The URL didn't work, please leave me a voicemail on their next stepts. Have a good week. mike 
 John,  Rick Bergsieker is the key here.  He can certainly direct you to the right people or others on his staff to help from Abu Dabai. Rick:  Houston ext:  66504 Abu Dabai:  9 714 331 8717  Mike 
 Attached for your reference and commentary is a first draft of a contact list to assist in communication of our key efforts globally.  Please make any additions, changes (and/or corrections) that you believe are appropriate and return to my office for update and distribution.  The goal is not to list out everyone working on a project or business but to include a couple of players if someone needs information about how this could apply to their business.  Thanks, mike 
 FYI, mike 
 John,  Jeff and I had many excellent meetings with your team and received a very= =20 good run down of their businesses.

 I am Cathy Phillips, Mike McConnell's assistant and I am responding to your message of his behalf.  He has asked that I schedule the meeting as requested in your message below.  Please contact me at 713-853-6898 or cathy.phillips@enron.com and I will be happy to assist in anyway that I can.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips 
 Allan, Thanks, I'll add them to the list.  I would appreciate a self appraisal feedback form on yourself with your list of accomplishments to date.  (I know it is hard to put together when you've been here for as long as you have).   mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 Kurt,  I agree with Eric.   California is very dangerous right now and we would need something very real to bring this to his attention.  Steve Kean  really liked the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll.  Mike 
 Chris,  Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.  I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up the email.  Thanks, Mike McConnell  PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary Cassat as a gift for her. 
 Joe,  As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.  When you get a chance to examine the EGM information and get your thoughts together, lets us know your views and your view of the best way forward.  We have everyone thinking about it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well.  It will help with Morten Erik as well.  Thanks, Mike 
 Morten Erik,  Thanks for the email.  I thought it was very thorough and hits all the main points that we are thinking about right now.  Jeff and I are very bullish on the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.  I believe that will also drive the structure.  You should have received an EGM overview yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our general direction.  I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.  We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&L but on transactions and growing the business.   I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.  I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.  It will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified in the mean time.  Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points tomorrow as well.  Thanks, Mike 
 Jeff,  FYI.  This is an excellent email and one that addresses all the issues we need to make decisions on.  Lets discuss because I have some views but am very open to others especially when I don't really know (first hand) what oppts really look like there.  We need to address quickly.  Mike 
 David,  Thanks for the email.  It did cause an interesting conversation without knowing what the situation was.  We all have very open relationships around here (it is why we are so successful as a company).  Please don't think twice about responding to Greg or any senior manager on an issue - but he would also have no issue with your response being cc back to Jeff and/or myself at the same time.  Thanks, Mike   PS;  we are all thinking about P+ constantly. 
 Richard,  I sent your info on to my direct reports for evaluation.  I've also sent on to others as well.  If there is an interest, you will be hearing from us.  Good luck, Mike 
 I would like to invite you and a guest to join me for the annual Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Gala to be held on May 12, 2001 at the Westin Galleria.

 This is fine with Mike McConnell. 
 Thanks for the response.  I found a beautiful Bonnard in London and NY.  I will be buying in next day or two.  Asking price is $9,500.  I will keep the Lautrecs in mind.  I think one is in my future - next.  I don't think I'll be buying one for a few months.  I'll get back to you.  Mike

  Howdy Heidi,  Well, your name is still on the list so that is good.  I hope all is well with you and your hubby.  Awfully weird times here in the home office.  Really strange vibes all over the building...people wondering about their jobs, sad about their retirement accounts and wonderment about how a proud (maybe too proud) Fortune 10 company could go down in ~3 weeks.  I guess it is the same or similar there too.  The pipeline group is working out.  I really like the people and am starting to get comfortable with the business and my regulated surroundings.

 Debbie,  I can't remember if I responded to you....I took vacation all last week.  Things are fine in my little corner (as good as can be expected).  A bit sad for a lot of other people around here.  As soon as I get caught up, I'll give you a call.  Mark

  Marissa,  Hey!  Just thinking about you.  I hope all is well out west.  Things here are sure interesting.  You should be very happy that you are not still here going through this stuff.  I feel pretty fortunate to be in the pipeline group.  This group is pretty lean so hopefully, there won't be many cuts (although I am the new boy in the group).  Many of the other groups are getting pretty anxious, including our former bunch.  We should find out pretty soon.  I was in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago and I called Rhondo.  He is working for the IOC and is in charge of all the fund raising for the Olympic charities.  It seems to be right up his ally.  He asked me to tell you hello.  Sarah and I took vacation last week.  I played golf in San Antonio (La Cantarra - in case Will is wondering - excellent course) and also played here in Houston with Frank, Marc and Bradford Brooks.  It was fun.  Please write back and let me know how you are doing.  How's the job, How's Will, How's LA, How was Thanksgiving...many questions.

  Mr. Joergensen,  A big "Howdy" from your Texas friend.  I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).  It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.  I hope you and your family are doing well.  As EBS changed direction, I did as well.  I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.  I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company).  I've been here for about a month and all is well.  The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).  It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.  I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.  Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.  I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.  It was a great concept and it worked.  Oh well.  We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.  Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.  Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.  It is a strange time here in America.  The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.  It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.  There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.  Take care Martin.

     University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.

   FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS T= RANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA= TION  09/27/2001=20 Foster Natural Gas Report=20 Page 7=20 (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.=20 FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain co= nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe= en PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various ship= pers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t= ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple= s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.=20 The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among= other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity ava= ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why= its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat= e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat= ed rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu= rther explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its = tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati= on of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity= on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it c= an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti= me.=20 Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier=20 FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently= arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject = of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Trans= western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transa= ctions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject= to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued = data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 orde= r, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr= ansactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the = negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would n= ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp= ers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactio= ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short = time.=20 In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore= Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market= price differentials between the California border and producing basins in = New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading= Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant= Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2= 7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl= uding surcharges and fuel.=20 In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc= rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu= ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: "Did Trans= western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und= er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate= d rate charges at substantially higher rates?" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10= .)=20 Background=20 Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to = its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-= 1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian= t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens= erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener= gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus= pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,= 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti= ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip= eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric= Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or= egon-California border.=20 According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w= ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum= FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of = surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at = the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. = The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu= estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit= y may be available on the GTN system.=20 GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew = service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t= o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.= Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on = the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations= .=20 Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:= =20 - Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity= arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem= pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. = Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to= pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re= verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c= apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t= hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that = the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th= e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate= , or the Southern California border market.=20 - Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco= urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested= it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind= ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the = cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believe= d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it "a prici= ng opportunity."=20 - According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t= he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volu= me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a= nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M= MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20 - Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 o= rder.=20 - Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t= han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim= e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi= rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi= eld to Malin.=20 - GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe= rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo= sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r= efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta= ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i= t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate= .=20 FERC Has Serious Concerns=20 According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions und= er investigation "present several serious concerns." Even with the addition= al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man= y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he= aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran= sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann= er consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t= he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity = that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t= o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp= ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa= ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in= the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima= ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains= t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als= o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20 Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's = posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca= pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak= e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap= acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is= awarded.=20 Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other = negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities avail= able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Se= mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0= 00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec= ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th= e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com= mission surmises.

   Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.  I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.

I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day.  Do you happen to know his email address?  Please let me know.  I hope all is well down south.

  Martina,  Howdy from Texas.  I am writing to see if you know where Christian has landed since the reorg. of EBS.  I'm glad to see you still have an Enron address.  I was telling a friend about our trip to Denmark and that museum that we saw there.  Please let me know if you know where Christian is.

  Jonathan,  Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.  I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.  Your resume looks very impressive.  I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.  I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.  Best of luck,  Mark

  Thanks Steve.  I won't be able to participate because I will be at the OU/Texas game.  (Boomer Sooner). 
  I had vacation on September 28th (Friday). 
   Sounds good.  I was in Norman this last week...recruiting, golf and KSU game (close).  I also picked up my tickets for this weekend.  I don't like thinking about the game, it makes me nervous but that is the fun of it.  By the way, can you tell me the line?  I'm sure you are favored.  Boomer Sooner, Mark

 Sorry, I've been in meetings.  I will be out of pocket until next week.  Let's talk then.  Mark 
  You can send it which ever way is easiest for you.  If it is just the same, I would send his seperately.  He is located at: EB1344.  Thanks,  Mark 
  No, It looks good.  I would actually add....  4707 Laurel (See Map) 
 Thanks pop,  Our schools have some pretty impressive records on that page.  By the way, that NCAA site is pretty interesting if you ever get bored. 
  I'd like to sign up for the ClickatHome service.  I have seen the Terms and Conditions and the Election Agreement but I haven't come across a way to sign up.  Please let me know how to sign up and order the equipment.  Thank you,  Mark McConnell  x57896 
  I have arranged to take off this Friday, so I will be able to attend.  I guess I'll get the directions to the golf course and other details from Weed and Dial.  If the teams are all full, put me on their team.  Otherwise, I'll play with anyone.  My game has gone down the tubes since I started the international work.  I hope to take care of that problem soon.....put me down as a 24 handicap.  I look forward to seeing you and the rest of the guys,  Mark 
  Jeff,  If you have any problems, let me know.  Otherwise, we'll talk later on how to resolve this.

 Guys,  Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  He would pound the phones.  Follow up if you want to talk with him.  I am going to forward on to technology guys too but wanted to give you first crack.  Mike 
 Jeff, attached below is my first cut at the org memo.  Please review, make additions,comments and corrections and return it via a word document on email.  Once i receive comments from all the individual business heads then I'll ciculate again for final review and commentary.  Mike 
 Ken,  Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people.  We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months.  I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.  If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.  Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance.  Mike 
 I'm in.  We'll get started in a couple of months.  Hopefully no sooner! Thanks, mike 
 I'm in. mike 
 Art,  Here is a few numbers.

 I don't know her.  Sorry. m 
 FYI , this is what Suzanne was talking about.  I didn't know any of this was going on.  I haven't talked with SN yet.  Do you have any comments before i do?  m 
 Thanks for the update.  You never appeared on camera and we thought that we had a video problem and that you weren't there. m 
 Eric, incase i forgot to forward, please followup and lets meet him.  I would like to attend. m 
 Virginia,  Thanks for the emails.  No interest in the above or the miro.  I am actively looking for a Pierre Bonnard lithograph, in color and signed.  Also looking for Lautrec but probably after Bonnard.  I will want to see numerous examples before I choose the Lautrec that we want.  If you have any Bonnards,  please let me know and send a copy of the image.  Mike 
 Per, I need a copy of the signature pages for all the signed dashes.  I want them for my files. Thanks, m 
 Louise,  You're very welcome.  It is always a pleasure to celebrate this blessed event.  This  is a truly special time in your life and I hope you and Marcus can relax and enjoy it.  This event will change your life and bring you true joy.  I remember the birth of our children like it was yesterday.  Simply writing this makes me feel great and my thoughts and prayers will be with you during this wonderful time.  Remember work will always be waiting for you;  this is what is truly important.  Sincerely, Mike 
 Ron, I met with him today and steered him in a couple of directions.  He is a very sharp guy and he should be able to find a commercial home somewhere in the near future.   I'll let you know after he talks about opportunities with various groups around EGM. Thanks, m 
 Bob,  He is now in town (he arrived on Monday).  Please call and leave him a voicemail.  We will meet with you. Mike 
 Doug, other than the worst greens of all time, i was very impressed with the course.  The layout of the front nine was outstanding.  10,11,13 were long and hard.  We shot 6 under and had a great time.  I bought a new odyssey putter and love it.  You guys did a nice job on the course.  mike

 Thanks!   You really changed the energy business. m 
 Thanks for the email.  Also, nice job on the phone today with Whalley.  I think you answered all of his questions and concerns and I think you'll like meeting him next week.  Mike 
 John, FYI, here is the presentation we discussed today.  This is internal only but it can act as a guide if you want to know what we are doing or our approach. This is a first draft and I'll send you an updated one when it is finished. m 
 Mark, Thanks for lunch, I really enjoyed our conversation. Here is the presentation we discussed.  This is an internal presentation only.  mike 
 It looks great. m 
 CP,  Go ahead and put me in the Marriot.  I should give this a try.  Plus it will make them plan better for us. m 
 Ted,  Howdy from Houston.  I didn't see the article but please fax me a copy of the piece if you have one.  Fax# is 713 853 1922.  I will make myself available after class to meet with whoever you want me to meet with.  Sorry I cant stay for the meeting, i really wanted to.  I will need a student to take me to the airport on Friday morning but don't need one on Thursday.  Do you want me to have breakfast or meet with the new dean?  Thanks and see you soon.  Mike 
 FYI, this is an interesting tool for when i am out. m 
 I am interested in the online version.  My login id is:  mmccon1 thanks, m 
 Dorie, thanks, but I need a sweater (M) not a shirt. m 
 Laura, I would like 2 Champions pavillion tickets for all 4 days.  I am not sure who I will take as of yet. thanks, mike 
 Haven't i already done this.  This went out a while ago didn't it? m 
 Sherri,  I would be happy to support Jeff.  I've sponsored 5 other people  for MS150 also but please put me down for $500 for Jeff.  If i am being cheap, let me know.  Thanks, mike 
 thanks. m 
 How's this for the next stab.  Please review, make changes and send back for a final.  I didn't try to make this just perfect but consoldite a little and add a little.  Thanks,  Mike 
 Sometimes it is great to be the old USA.  Jury's rule, wigged Lords drool. m 
 Have it sent to me and I'll make sure it gets looked at. cheers, m 
 Shanna,  Please make this happen ASAP.  I thought he was done.  Also, I would like to see a list of all of our key people and their conctract expiration dates.  I believe you have that but I've not seen a copy.  Thanks, mike 
 The cat needs something. I had fun on the trip.  Jim is a good guy and I'll send you a copy of the pictures for him when i get them back. m 
 Doug,  The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever miss the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were not at max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler weather. What a great tournament.  Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game at Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this year.  Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello.  Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home email address via return email?  Ours is mmccontex@aol.com.  Mike 
 Eric, What do you think? m 
 FYI, as we discussed. m 
 Dorie,  Thanks for everything on the Masters trip.  I thought it went very well.  I enjoyed our shirt and sweater gift but i have a question.  I got a large sweater and need a medium.  Do you have a medium left?  I brought in the large to exchange.  Thanks, Mike 
 Mary Nell,  I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.  I can't imagine how you are feeling.  As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the teams efforts.  It speaks volumes about the UK and our independence!  No way to take this to the EU?  mike 
 Ron,  I hope you had a good week.  I've thought a lot about your family and you've been in my prayers.  I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with this while you were away.  As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed are:  Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles) Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking) Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission) Dr. Wayne Dyer (many) Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others)  Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.  To my extremee frustration I can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.  I got a lot out of all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.  I am a great believer in the old saying, "When the student is ready the teacher will come".  As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have had a profound effect on me and my family.  A few direct tangible results include:  my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation collection (over 100 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and growing) .....  When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can definitely find time for lunch.  Mike 
 Louise, I thought you would want to see this since you were there during all of those times. m 
 Thanks for the update. m 
 Christie, I don't have any interest.  Jeff Shankman is a Penn guy and I am sure he would like to do it and would be very effective. mike 
 I had a good interview with Andy Maus yesterday.  He is a strong candidate and I wanted to make you aware of his background.  His resume is attached below.  Please contact Andy if you are interested in talking with him.  Thanks. Mike 
 I had a good interview with Andy yesterday.  He is a strong candidate and you may want to consider him for origination and mid-marketing opportunities. His resume is attached below.

 All,  Attached is a presentation that I have put together to review EGM's activities.  The purpose is to provide an information package on our businesses for Senior mgt and Investor relations.  This will not be distributed externally but will education people on our businesses and some of our goals.  Please take a few minutes to briefly  review and make any comments and/or changes and fax  or provide a hard copy back to me.  You can send me copies of just the pages that have updates.  Also please focus on the map and insure that there are not mistakes ( i found some recently).  There is also a shorter version presentation that is more external and once I've updated both, i will send everyone a copy via email for your reference and use.  Thanks, mike 
 Yes, that is the level that we will be talking to him about. m 
 Emilio, let me know when it is official and draft up a congratulatory letter for my signature and send via email.  I'll put on my letterhead and sign. thanks, m 
 John,  Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods.  He worked for me in 2 areas,  including directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.  He was an associate at the time.  He is interested in coming back and is talking with many areas of enron for positions.  His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.  If she does, he would really like to come as well - if it is possible.  I didn't know if you have a need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an origination type of role.  I wanted you to have shot at him as well.  Mike

He has offer opportunities at EBS and EES and has been talking with Billy Lemmons about ag.  Trevor is great and would be excellent in a Jr. commercial roll in an origination type of function.  He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have
