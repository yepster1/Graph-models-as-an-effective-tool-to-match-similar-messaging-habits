now that is still and option and see if it still works.  Thanks, Mike  Go Sooners.  Shame about Hipel, he has thrown away his Heisman over the last couple of weeks.  Do you agree? 
 Pelt,  Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank God.  Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up. I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .  Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that you are in Telluride right now on holiday.  Give my love to all.  Mike    PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun year.  It is nice to be back. 
 Karen, yes i like the "sauces" reference.  I sound like an idiot.  I can understand his mistake but i thought i discussed what it meant.  Skilling will love that reference. mike 
 William,  I am very interested in both the Signac and Cross.  A few  questions about the pieces.  You referenced Meier Graefe for "Pan" for both pieces.  I don't know what that means could you please clarify?  Also I don't understand the reference to an Album.  Is the Signac numbered?  Are either signed on the stone?  Thanks, mike 
 Billy, great idea, if you have a list i would really like to send them an email. Thanks, mike  PS good luck with the game on friday. 
 Mark,  FYI, here is the latest update on our Q4.  We are making headway and the list shows how we intend to make up the short fall.  As I stated on my voicemail yesterday, upon our return from the holiday,  I will be even more proactively managing the Q4 P&L.  Have a great holiday. mike 
 Jim,  Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.  I know how difficult your job is day to day without items like this popping up.  I spoke with Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so appreciative it is hard to describe it.  The school constantly talks about Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now printers.  Thanks again and have a good holiday.  Sincerely, Mike McConnell 
 All,  Below is a resume of Manuel.  I met with him and has a good background and is a superior performer.  He is willing to locate from Manilla and would go to Sydney and Tokyo.  Interesting origination oppt.  Mike   List

 The following message that was originally sent with three attachments was returned as undeliverable.  I am sending the message again with only one attachment and then will follow-up by sending the remaining two presentations under separate messages due to the size of each of the files.  Sorry for the delay. 
 As mentioned in my previous message, another one of the presentations that I attempted to send to you earlier is attached below. 
 As mentioned in my previous message, the attached file is the last presentation of the three that I attempted to send to you previously.  If you have any problems opening the file, please notify me and we will send you the hard copies immediately.  Thank you.

 John,  Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed my visit to the middle east and our discussion.  I really appreciate your insight.  I am very committed to the project and many of the other opportunities that Rick's team has put together. I'll see you in the new year. Sincerely, Mike 
 Ahmad,  Thank you for the email.  I enjoyed our visit very much.  I wanted to thank you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away from your family.  I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the Dolphin project.  I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put together in the Middle East.  I promised you some of the speeches that I have delivered and attached below are 3 different ones that illustrate Enron's view of the future.  Thanks again.  Mike 
 Wow.  I didn't know.  Glad to have you back. m 
 Greg, a quick note, although a little unclear, all of your businesses remain in EGM and are not going to go to R McDonald's new group.  Please inform your group.  Thanks, Mike 
 For your further handling.  I don't know what this is. m 
 Eric, I was examining EGM's businesses for 2001 and I wanted to ask you a question about your specific business.  As you examine your goals and objectives, I would like to know what you think I could do to help you accomplish your plan.  Please send me a return email with 3 specific items that I could do personally to add to your business.  Thanks, Mike 
 John, FYI and consideration. m 
 please do. 
 Joe, I think the entire event was outstanding.  I also enjoyed it but my hand still hurts!  Ken went through it today at the executive committee and he talked about the incredible potential and the job you were doing. Congratulations again, mike  PS Weekly calls are a favorite of mine as you know. 
 We did fall apart in baseball this year.  We are not a 1 sport team we are the sport team.  Football is just a tad more important then the others.  On last count our 7 national championships in "the" sport does add up.  By the way, we hold 2 national championships today, football and the mighty women's softball.  Sooners 2 - Rustbelt 0 m 
 Om, Sorry I am not aware of anyone in particular.  Good luck, I believe that there are huge opportunities for you out there. Mike 
 Hi Nina -  It is highly doubtful that Mike will be available to attend the Art Committee meeting since his big 2001 budget meeting with Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling will begin at 2:00 p.m. on that same day.  Can you do us a big favor and please also send the Art Committee messages to me.  When Mike is traveling it makes it much easier if I have been copied on messages that involve putting meetings on Mike calendar.  I hope all is going well for you.  Thanks so much.  Cathy P. X-36898 
 Cool! m 
 Christine,  I so rarely write love notes.  17 years ago it was common place, even a daily event.  What happened to that guy?  I could have been a cartoonist in another life.  I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China, soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the airport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by yourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out trick or treating.  I bet they look great.  As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the ceremony yesterday and said, "What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron here) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should see me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home.  Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even imagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a priest in a former life.  Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this airplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the internet.  I love you and miss you very much.  Eternally, Michael  See you soon and in time for soccer.  xxxxxooooo 
 Dear beautiful and majestic butterfly and wonerful wizard Harry Potter,  How are you!!!!   Did you have a great time trick or treating?  I so wish I could have been there.  You know I wouldn't have missed it if I could have possibly been there.  Did Mommy take a lot of pictures?  I hope so.  I can't wait to see them.  Will you show me what you looked like when I get home?  I love you,  Daddy 
 Brent, I would like this to become formal policy within EGM as well. I know that it exists and is around but no one is familiar with this or exactly how it works.   We have made strides with credibility with RAC regarding coal and we are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but I would like to put out a policy like this for us.  Please take a look at this and draft a memo that can be sent out addressing the approval procedures and the guidelines and limits around them. Thanks, mike 
 John,  What exactly are we trading here and how do you think it is going? mike 
 Louise, I was clearing some old emails.   What ever happened with this guy?  Did you hire him or blow him off? Thanks, Mike 
 Im out of town m 
 All, I haven't heard back.  Please respond to the email. Let me know if you didn't receive it. Thanks, mike 
 How about my emails! m 
 David,  Any update from your last email a couple of weeks ago?  Thanks, Mike 
 Hi, I noticed that there are several people missing from my personal address list.  Would you please check to make sure it is up to date and add missing directs.  L Lawyer, J Nowlan, B Price, add T Meyers, R McDonald.  There may be more. Thanks, m 
 Cindy, I don't think we have a fit here but would you please follow-up and let him know that we looked around and couldn't find anything.  Also please forward to other groups as well.  Thanks, mike 
 FYI. m 
 Thanks for the update. m 
 Rick,  While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.  The bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them, thus help ourselves.  We need to look into this and I would like your initial opinion.  This is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.  He believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues. If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport.  Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?  Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.  Sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further.  Mike 
 please co-ordinate  and make sure that Lea has your email address for distribution. thanks, m 
 Cindy, I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.  The company  is on a roll and offers an interesting product.  I have attached his email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring it up to you.  Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.  Do we do anything like this with our employees?  I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  Unless you think it is a total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch. I would of course attend as well if you like.  They have an impressive customer list already.  Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.  Thanks, Mike 
 Vance, I've been attempting to call you .  Your voicemail is full and my return voicemail keeps getting rejected.  I suggest you clear out some room. I would be happy to change my schedule and meet either at 12 or 12:30.  I don't really want an hour with him but will do what you need. mike 
 Another one.  Any ideas?  Coal in Asia? m 
 Jim,  I just wanted to thank you for participating in the walk. It means a lot to me.  Thanks for your support.  See you out there.  Mike 
 FYI m 
 Guys, what do you think?  Any ideas or interest? m 
 CP, Please send on and co-ordinate a 30 minute meeting with Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen for discussion.  They might be able to use him as well. Thanks, m 
 Gene, thanks for the follow up.  I am definitely interested in talking with him.  Please set up and co-ordinate with Cathy Phillips @ 36898.  Also need him to talk with Jeff Shankman.  Thanks, Mike    Enron North America Corp. 
 What about David Turlip?  Also are there some other general announcements and or clarifications that you want to address?  eg  mid marketing, other new efforts or goals for the upcoming year. m 
 Dana,  Hello from Tokyo.  I sent you a reply and forwarded your resume to our HR group.  I don't know if you got my reply the day I received your resume.  I have had a lot of people tell me that they didn't get a response from me about the same time as you contacted me.  My sent mail doesn't list you as a completed return email.  I hope all is well.  Mike 
 CP, Howdy from Tokyo.  Please add this to my calendar and send a fax with all of my new commitments and parties to chris via home fax. thanks, m 
 Happy Halloween guys!  I am sorry I am not there, I really wanted to see a beautiful butterfly and a Harry Potter.  Please make sure that you have Mommy take a lot of pictures!  I love you,  Daddy (the King) 
 FYI, he looks interesting. m 
 jim, i don't really have an opinion but i certainly won't get in your way on the approval. mike 
 Maryfran,  I would like to thank you for your very nice nomination.  As flattered as I am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.  I am very proud of our accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology group but my tenor was only about a year.  In August I was asked to take on another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.  Although this was an even more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave the technology world.  Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and innovation.  He has been in the tech business for about 17 years.  Sincerely, Mike S. McConnell 
 Good idea. m 
 Angela, by the way I was not CEO of ENW I was Vice Chairman and COO.  Whalley was and is CEO. Please correct if possible. m 
 Jeff, what do you think of this guy's background?  Do you know him? m 
 Rick, I am scheduled to be out on vacation but I think you should have the meeting if it still fits peoples schedules.  I am doubtful but will look at later. m 
 I didn't call rick.  did you?  What do you think? m 
 Jay, thanks for the donation and commitment.  the check should be made out to JDF.  We'll do all the matching. Hope all is well. mike 
 Cool.  Thanks for sharing that with me. m 
 please review file and format for nomal layout vs landscape. thanks, m 
 Bob, Thank you very much for supporting our effort. mike 
 Gary,  1.  Correct 2.  Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for all of it's employees.  Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year. The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.  It is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance.  The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources.  It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver. Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC. 3.  I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way.  An example would be that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology.  and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage.  It was a very customer driven (internal and external customers) process.  It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the bottom line rather than simply a cost center.  I hope that helps.  Sincerely, Mike 
 Cool!  Thanks for sharing that with me.  See you at the walk. mike 
 Thank you for the message.  We just tested this link and it is working fine on this end.  Can you please give your IT help desk a call and see if they can check this out for you on your system.  In addition, we will report this problem to our IT support group.  Thanks again.  Cathy Phillips for Mike McConnell    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jeff,  Sorry for the slow response.  I don't have a strong opinion either way.  I am fine with the combo idea.  In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.  I am still slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.  I am almost caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and best way to communcate.  Thanks, Mike 
 Jeff,  Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday. During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do you think?  If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.  Mike 
 Jeff,  I like the memo and I'll keep my ears open for feedback.  Your presence is needed more than I thought.  My gut told me that they really needed your help but its more than that.  Taking contol of that P&L is the highest return of your time and talent for EGM and for Enron, atleast for this quarter.  They will learn or they will be out.  mike 
 John, We're getting old. mike 
 Guys,  Attached below is a presentation that I put together for M Frevert for the latest analyst presentation.  We kept it to only a few businesses -  they didn't end up using any of it.  I do however want to have an EGM presentation that everyone can use.  Please prepare a section on each of your businesses and return via email or hard copy.  Don't worry about power point, simply the dot points that you want on the page.  Thanks, mike 
 Bob, I don't want to wait for Mike, please set up the meeting without him. He can join us by phone if needed. Thanks, m 
 Wow! thanks, m 
 I thought you would enjoy this. PS bring the magic dollar to lunch! m 
 Cool! m 
 Dana,  Thanks for the call and email.  I will look at your resume and get back to you .  Mike 
 Greg, I need to talk with you about your EBS/fiber project.  Please give me a call in the morning.  I'll be in first thing in the morning.  I don't have your telephone number.  You are listed on a Houston number. Mike 
 Gary, I turned 40 in March. Thanks, MIke 
 As discussed. m 
 Virginia, Thanks for the email.  Go ahead and send it unframed.  I don't  remember what the frame looked like so it will probably be easier to send without.  For my later reference, how much do you charge for framing? Mike 
 Doug,  Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are provided as a service to save money. By the way, saving money is real money to Enron.   Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can put it in context?  Thanks, Mike 
 Jim, I think it does.  I am usually unable to attend so I would really like you to stick with this as our rep.  Also we will talk about the best uses of your time after this weeks budget meetings.  I'll give you a call. Thanks, Mike 
 please put on my calendar. m 
 Thanks, mike 
 Ok m 
 Mike McConnell asked me to contact you to set up a 30 minute appointment with him and Jeff Shankman for next week..

 Hi Eric -  I am Mike's assistant and I believe you discussed this meeting with my clerk when I was out of the office on Monday.  I am preparing Mike's calendar for tomorrow and I would like to make sure that I have all the correct information for him regarding the El Paso meeting.  Can you please provide the exact details for the El Paso meeting?  In particular, will you be meeting Mike at his office or does he need to meet you somewhere else?  At what time does he need to meet you?  Any specific information that you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  Cathy Phillips 713-853-6898 
 Hi Dennis -  Mike McConnell plans to attend the luncheon and he would like to sit at the Enron table.   Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips for Mike McConnell X-36898 
 Please put on Jeff's and my calendar for 30 minutes. m 
 Gary, this is the guy we talked about.  He is worth atleast a look.  Ex Cargill. Please meet with him. m 
 Joe, we are both there.  I am also going to Dubai and Jeff will go to Australia.  I'll be in the night before and out the morning after.  Hope all is well.  Cathy is co-ordinating everything. Looking forward to it. m 
 Erin, here are a couple of responses.  Please rewrite as you see fit. Mike  1. Agriculture.    We are currently looking at and studying the industry.  We have traded some commodities as well.  We believe that there may be large opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.  We have spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our strategy.  This is very early in development but we have high expectations in this area.  I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time. Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.  2.  Rail.  We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and transportation businesses.  I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of rail.  It is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.   Dan Reck is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the US. 
 Dan, Thanks for your donation.  I appreciate your support. m 
 Joe, In the next couple of weeks. thanks, m  PS - Amazed at my quick response? 
 Can you believe my email! m 
 Ron,  Hello.  I am back in the country -  I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked up the car.  I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very well.  The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car before I went off to Asia.  I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.   I have had many comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of Enron purchases of Mercedes.  I am a Mercedes believer.  Sincerely, Mike McConnell 
 Virginia,  Thanks for the email.  I apologize for the slow response.  Life is crazy and I have been back on the road again.  I am interested in purchasing "Blue Note" and I understand that the price is $4,500 framed as before.  I am chasing down another piece, as i think i have stated before, but have not closed yet on it.  It is significantly less but I have not closed the deal.  I would like to own the piece.  Do you think there is any room on the price from your seller?  I will commit to you but I can't leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience. That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.  I will commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.  you can tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that price.  I don't know if that works for you or the seller.  Please let me know what you think.  I am in this week.  Thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  I am ready to make a decision.  Mike 
 Try John Paveto at 57038 or George Wasaff at 67351 m 
 Good point on extra space.  Please call Wes Colwell and discuss.  I think that makes 33 less of an option. m 
 Cool, nice job. m 
 liz, I can't believe it - although he will never show!.   I would be happy to fill out a form when it comes out. Hope all is well. m 
 Larry, here is the publication we discussed.  If you have an interest, let this guy know. Thanks and welcome aboard.  Wes Colwell is looking for an office.  Right now there are 2 oppts he is looking at; 1 up here on 33 which is a problem, and 1 office on finance floor.  Do you have a preference, if we have an option? m 
 George,  Attached for your review and commentary is a copy of a first draft of a presentation that i am creating on EGM.  This is for an upcoming analyst presentation and for our ongoing use.  Please review and make any comments you feel are needed.  Especially focus on coal which is on page 5.  Please take a quick look and return your initial comments quickly.  I need to get out a new and better draft ASAP.  Also, how do we illustrate your business graphically.  Please decide, fill in and I'll have our graphics guy make it look pretty.  Thanks, mike 
 Rick,  Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think? I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress. Thanks, Mike 
 Thanks. m 
 cool m 
 Congrats!!!  I'll see if i can make a combination trip.  m 
 Thor,  A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank you for all your effort.  I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to discuss some of the ideas you presented.  Mike 
 Gary,  There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It inspired me to keep going on a "nontraditional" path.  The other big  impact moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, "its a matter of survival" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.  I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece.  Thanks, mike 
 I like that schedule.  the game was great!  The cold and rain couldn't effect my enjoyment.  long over due.  Reality comes back on Sat however. m 
 Thanks, it was great and long over due.  The cold and rain didn't stop the ultimate enjoyment including 35,000 people chanting "over rated".  It was great and we must enjoy it until the Sat. when reality comes back to the sooners and we lose the next 2 or 3 straight.  K State, Neb and Tex A&M. Ouch, nice 4 game stretch. m 
 i'm all for it.  Please move forward.  He is a great guy but don't forget he is happy in his current job and all of this must be carefully done for him and not to disrupt his current job.  Let me know how it is progressing.
