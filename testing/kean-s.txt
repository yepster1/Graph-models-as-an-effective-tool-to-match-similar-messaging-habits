 Summary of yesterdays meeting attached        Susan J Mara 01/14/2001 01:16 AM 
 Attached is a summary of the Jan 13 Davis-Summers summit on the California power situation.  We will be discussing this at the 2:00 call today. 
 I am contacting you on the recommendation of Pug Winokur, who is on our Board of Directors.    Enron has formed an Advisory Council which consists of academicians, public policy thinkers and media, together with Enron executives.  I would like to invite you to address the group on E-Commerce issues at our next meeting  (Friday, September 8th in Houston).  Attached is a list of our Advisory Council members.     I think you will find this group interesting and thought provoking.  Please contact me at your earliest convenience at 713-853-1586.

 recommendations 
 Joe:  Thanks again for coming to Houston this week.  CNN has a compelling brand and we believe that a number of the components of your proposal are worth exploring further.  However, we are not interested in pursuing discussions of the exclusive sponsorship.  I want to stress, though, that many of the elements of the package you and David presented are of interest and we would like to continue discussions with you.  Please get in touch with us to discuss how we proceed from here.  Thanks again. 
 Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:  Urged us to "stay at the table".  Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices).  QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity).  Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh.  If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply).  Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening.  Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?).  Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.  Thinks it's nearly a "done deal" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.  Says securitization may be harder to get.  Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.  Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow. 
 I tinkered a bit more with the background doc. 
 Nathan, give me  call if you can -- 713-853-1586.  I'm EVP and Chief of Staff for Enron.  We met during the on-campus interview process.  I know we have extended an offer and I'm still hoping you'll accept.  Call me.

 Call me about this 
 Attached is the presentation and speech notes that Ken Lay used on Wednesday at the Austin meeting with Bush, etc. 
 I spent a little over 30 minutes with Robert.  He is a very sharp guy and has a great deal of relevant government experience.  While I don't have a position that would be suitable for his experience level (all of my senior positions are filled), he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an open position.  My impression from Robert is that, while he has some interest in Public Affairs, his main interest is in a commercial position.  I stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could build to it over time.  His main concern was that he not get "lost in the system" if he came in at a level below business unit head.  I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time.

 OK to update    Sherri Sera 12/29/2000 09:51 AM 
 Scott sent this to Marty, but I assume you already have had communications with him about this. 
 Please respond and copy me. 
 Oops. My computer sent the message before I was finished.  I continue to hope that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management. I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona). I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.  Hang in there. 
 Michelle - I think Linda would fill the spot you and I talked about very well.  Linda is the new head of our DC office; she was asst secy of treasury under Bentsen, Rubin and Summers.  She is very well respected in washington.  She received the Alexander Hamilton award fro Secy Summers -- the highest award presented by the US Treas dept.  She has gotten up to speed very quickly on our issues and I think would serve the progam well (and she's already paid for!!). 
 Forgot to include you on this. 
 We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today. 
 fyi 
 Rosie -- I'm not sure if this went through ... I couldn't find it in my "sent file".  Karen -- attached are the documents I mentioned to you a minute ago. 
 This is very good work.  You make all the points we need to make without spraining anything in the process.  You have been doing a superb job under very difficult circumstances.  On another note:  I don't know if you received my page, but the meeting with Davis was cancelled so I flew back to Houston.  We are trying to get another time, perhaps as early as this week.  Davis did meet with Greenspan and Summers, both of whom we had briefed extensively. 
 The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.  Apparently, he was trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we were bumped.  We are trying to set a new time.  I will share with the Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you helped put together.  Thanks 
 The plan was to hit the issue twice -- once in the short format of Ebiz and at greater length in the longer format of the October issue of Enron Business.  Please let Paul know. 
 Please see the revised memo, which is the final version. 
 As we discussed 
 Steve asked that I forward this revised version to you.   I have incorporated Michelle Cash's changes. 
 I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of those efforts?  Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in California perhaps we should consider it.

 Background information.  I'd like to talk to Ken about making the call. . . I'll see him at Exec comm today. 
 We'll have the usual macroeconomic update from Larry Lindsay and Gavyn Davies, the domestic political update from Bill Kristol and some presentations from Gary Hamel and others focussing on Enron NetWorks. 
 See attached WSJ article, particularly the last paragraph.  The message is: there has not been enough deregulation;  the government is still very much in the way.  California is a perfect example:  the market has responded to demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage. 
 As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use.  Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.  In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not deregulation.  When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market).  In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds.  The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation.  Policy makers should:  Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed.  Expedite interconnection of new generation.  Expedite siting of new facilities.  Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions.   Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office. 
 Please see the attached memo.

 Thanks for taking the time to discuss the Enron Advisory Council today.  I think the second topic you mentioned "Escaping the Inherent Limits of Success" would be a great discussion starter.  I'll add it to the agenda and look forward to seeing you there. 
 I've made some changes (shown in bold).  Bracketed text indicates a deletion  . 
 In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at Enron.  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone). This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.  We now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites.  I suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization 
 My message cut off...  The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. . solutions which have become available only recently.  Why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization.  I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.  I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements.   I am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron. 
 Yes.  Contact either Gia or John and get the ball rolling.  Thanks 
 Should we (or ESCA) start looking for opportunities like this now to get the word out? 
 Please forward to public affairs group. 
 fyi 
 I don't really have a problem with this, but I thought that all VP promotions were supposed to go through our year end process.  That's what I have been saying in response to the inquiries I am getting.  Ken, being newly back in the fold, likely didn't know about the process. 
 fyi 
 We handed the Oped to DeLay's staff at lunch.  I think we're finished for now. 
 Any interest? 
 Not yet.  May not be until sept 5 as ken is on vacation.  but there is a chance that ken will try to reach him in the meantime.  I'll let you know when I hear. 
 the price might be a bit stiff, particularly in light of the following: I don't think we need the DC grass tops component.  we have an effective set of messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.  Perhaps we could use Charlie as a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson, Fleischman-Hillard, Divall, etc.  I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however, (and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly). 
 Eric - I think the release looks fine.  Shelley -- I take it there are no affiliate issues here (or they have been fully vetted)? 
 this is fantastic!! 
 FYI.  These are the items I left Ken a voicemail about. 
 Is this someone in the analyst/associate program? 
 You probably saw the announcement that Mike Mcconnell is now CEO of Enron Global Markets.  EGM will be focussing on a number of new and existing markets (including coal, LNG, crude and products, interest rates, agricultural commodities, equities, weather, etc).  One of the markets Mike's group is actively considering is transport capacity.  I mentioned your work in the area.  He is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a chance to review it. 
 In case you had not heard, Lou Pai has done some fundraising for Franks and both he and his(Lou's) sister know him fairly well.  Keep it in mind if at some point we need to get in to see him. 
 I think the Qs and As look good. I wouldn't bring up the California situation (eliminate the second half of A25). 
 I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem -- that a "reliability bill" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem. Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go out at all. 
 Have we suggested to FERC staff that they force the ISO and PX to open the "blackbox" to show how they determine dispatch?  In addtion, if you are not on the distribution list for Belden's memo on utility behavior in California this summer, I will forward it to you.  It suggests some other areas FERC ought to be looking into. 
 Looks like you got this earlier.  I think it has new relevance in light of FERC's announced investigation. 
 It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think our message should generally be: We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers. We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.  San Diego has offers in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers. Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution. 
 I will be out of town that day (a meeting I can't move).  Please continue to let me know about future meetings.    Lora Sullivan@ENRON 12/16/99 03:25 PM 
 In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.  I think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the commodity price guarantees. 
 We don't have revised versions yet.  when we do, we will probably only want to put some (not all) of the documents on the intranet. 
 I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future). Can we make that argument work?

 While the more-open gas market may have more tools available than in electric markets, market solutions have been proposed as an alternative to legislated rate caps in the hard hit San Diego market.  Gavin -- please send Irwin copies of the articles on the offers made in San Diego. 
 Attached is a draft of the Agenda we discussed.  Irwin - I show Joskow on here but he has already declined (his wife is having surgery right before our meeting date).  We may want to consider someone like Seabron Adamson (Frontier Economics) or perhaps someone else. 
 No.  We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.  Thanks 
 Looks ok

 Attached are some late night thoughts on the portal.  Most of this is focussed on the portal for opinion leaders, but some of it could be applicable to the comemrcial portal as well.  Could you forward this to Palmer ... for some reason my address book doesn't pull him up when I'm off the system. 
 I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone. 
 Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself.

 I'm still a junkie .... please email copies of the orders.

 See last story attached.  Congratulations, it looks like you are shaking things up in typical Enron fashion. 
 See attached 
 Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system. 
 I couldn't open link.  I s this something new for me to sign or have I already complied? 
 Attached is the final letter.  Please note - there was a small change at the top of page 2. 
 I'm putting in for Chairman and CEO of rationalizations and euphemisms. 
 I think this is an excellent letter.  I agree with Sue's comments and have included her changes on Page 3.  All changes have been marked in this version. 
 Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business. Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings outlook,"  said Skilling. 
 My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading. 
 As discussed. 
 I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners. California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media. 
 I love you.  Call me. 
 The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:  On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "retailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances. 
 Has this previously been covered by the Office of the Chairman budget?  If so, please handle; otherwise let me know.

 I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU. Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification) today. 
 Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings? 
 Looks good to me. 
 I think this letter looks fine.  For the hororarium, I suggest we use whatever we paid Kudlow for his participation (I believe Ken also entered into a consulting contract with Kudlow, but I'm referring only to the one-time payment for the advisory council meeting he attended). 
 Who is Paul Kaufan????? 
 Follow up to previous message:  I would not have "managing for the slow down" on the agenda.  I don't think it is as relevant to our business as it is to many others. 
 I have looked it over.  I think they would do a good job.  Another idea: Dick Foster (advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey) has a great book out: "Creative Destruction".  I was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research.  He is a very good presenter; he knows Enron well; and his work is first rate.  He might be a good addition.  I have an idea on the breakout sessions.  It needs some work but I'd like to talk it through with you. 
 FYI - itinerary. 
 I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the "reregulation threat" at the next meeting.  Below are some of my observations:  While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some of the data). There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national political issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to "big oil" (which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque reliance on the market). Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at least on the electricity issue.  We did some focus group testing recently in Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego price quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it.  So, while the issue has the potential for political traction, it may not have caught on yet (except in places like San Diego and New York city. The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in electricity markets.  Investigations of out of state "price gougers and profiteers" have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have been put in place.  They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets. Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high elsewhere in the West, power flows out of California to those other markets. Ironically, though I can't explain it in classical economic terms, the setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than enough supply.  For the most part, though, the caps and the other political reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to throw the deregulation plan out and start over, and the retail price caps have been relatively narrow ... so far. Outside of California, the authors of other states' deregulation plans have distinguished their proposals from California's.  Regulators and legislators from such diverse places as Connecticut, Texas and Alberta have gone out of their way to defend their plans and explain why "California won't happen here."  For the most part, then, the reaction to California has been positive from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated.  There does remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled.  The story is a bit more grim in states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with their plans:  I think it's off the agenda in most places.  The fact that most of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard. At the federal level there has been a combination of the "burn the village in order to save it" approach  -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure to reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for comprehensive reform. All in all, I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an opportunity:  business is booming;  we sell protection from price volatility and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of major newspapers.  On the public policy front we need to convert the controversy into productive action.  Our target has been FERC -- they are somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the market. Enron's response:  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry groups and let them carry the message; our concern was that Enron -- a company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not make the most attractive champion for the open market message.  We hoped that the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle.  It's fair to say that they fumbled the ball:  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state profiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief.  They were also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message.  We are now working the issue directly.  We are working the issue on a number of levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to numerous reporters and editorial writers.  As time goes on, the information and reporting has gotten somewhat better.  2)  Govt relations - we have been pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to build capacity but the government won't let it).  This may be the best environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process.  Also, in typical Enron fashion, we put a deal on the table.  We offered to sell power to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable rates for their customers at below current rates.  Our offer was followed by nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was offering better solutions than California politicians.  SDG&E dropped the ball, unfortunately.  Instead of seizing the opportunity, they ended up going along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue a massive deferral account.  At the federal level we are contacting members, the DOE and FERC.  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish "leveling the playing field" in wholesale markets so power can get from where it is to where its needed.  Additionally, we are developing a prepackaged system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away any lingering excuses or delays).  3) Overall messaging -- we have been working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their resonance at the grassroots level.  As we hone these messages we will be using them in the fora we are currently working. Overall, we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment, but capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot. An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this:  much of the problem in power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices, particularly natural gas.  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are advocating for electricity, so how can we maintain that the problem in power markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices?  The answer is somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current debate:  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were pre-deregulation;  long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( the curve is "backwardated" (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current spot prices); and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid the spike?).  When all else fails, a big part of the problem can be blamed on OPEC.  We haven't had this thrown at us yet, but we are trying to anticipate it and have answers at the ready.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The issue is a great example of the intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should promote a lively discussion when we get together.  Let me know if there is anything else you need. 
 You have probably heard this already, but on July3, the CPUC postponed their direct access decision until mid-August. 
 Thank you.  I enjoyed the discussion very much.  The DoD has significant challenges, but if the group participating in the meeting was any indication, they have some first rate people working on those challenges.  If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to call. 
 Please add Dave Delainey, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchens to updates with significant news like this one (they may already get them ... I didn't read through all the names). 
 Ken hasn't mentioned it.  I'll ask next time I talk to him. 
 Has this gone to Ken yet.  If not please send. 
 Sorry for the delay (I had major e-mail problems).  The memo looks good; let's get it out. 
 Yes, Phillippe left to join a firm in New York -- I don't know who. 
 You may want to forward this to your customers. 
 I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 26th.  Do we pass or is there an alternative?  Can we get done what we need to get done with Ken's visit the following week? 
 Rep Scott McGinnis (colo) told Ken that he would like to be briefed on the California and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue. Also, don't forget that we need to go see your buddy Newt!

 Thanks anyway.  no need to do anything right now.  enjoy your vacation. 
 Fyi - price cap events of the week. 
 Ken left a msg for me on Sunday.  He was able to return Bryson's call.  Not much new:  Ken got Jeff's paper will try to reach Hertzberg on Monday. Bryson gave an update (very consistent with yours on Fri) Wants us to think creatively about "how to keep DWR contracts from preventing the comprehensive solution" and how to address the concerns of the state treasurer. Ken tried to reach Pete Peterson (Blackstone) but did not make contact. 
 I am having lunch on Monday with Michael Isikoff, a newsweek investigative reporter.  He is doing yet another Ken Lay/Enron political influence story. One of the things he wants to talk about though -- and I think this is a good sign -- is Enron's climate change policy and how it compares to the administration's.  What I need from you, as soon as possible, is a timeline (what the Administration said when -- doesn't have to be down to the day); the Administrations position; and our position (and how they differ).  Borrow heavily from existing materials. 
 No need to review with policy committee. 
 I may be adding someone to the agenda -- Vikram Pandit (recommended by Ken Lay and Pug Winokar) 
 Attached is Jeff's backgrounder in the event you call Hertzberg. 
 Thank you...I think

 I set up a meeting for next Friday in Washington with Ed G. and Ralph Reed, starting at 7:30 am. 
 I think you are right.  I thought we were going to do both. 
 Would it be possible to use LiveLink to capture the information we gathered for the organization/budget review (such as functions of the different groups and the roles and responsibilities of the different individuals, budgets etc)?  I hate to see all that ggod information sit idle. 
 Please call me. 
 You may have seen this when it first came out a while back ... but it's worth a rerun. 
 Please update my bio to include Human Resources and add some boilerplate on Enron. 
 Can one of you forward to Ed, or whoever you feel appropriate? 
 Looks good; nice work. Let's get it out

 John Brindle, David Cromley and others in the Corporate Business Controls group (formerly part of EBS) have been working over the last several weeks to make sure that we can get our people out of Dabhol if there are threats to their safety.  While no plan is perfectly reliable (particularly during monsoon season) we believe that we are as ready as we can be. 
 Will you be filling out mine? 
 We may be able to handle this specific issue outside the policy committee, but I think it would be a good idea to set the next one anyway.  I'm sure we'll have something we'll need to talk about. 
 Looks fine to me.  Maureen - please keep on file 
 Attached is the draft.  It combines all three announcements into one, with a common format. It reflects a "just the facts" approach.  Let me know if you have changes (or answers to the questions in the text). 
 Per your discussion with Steve. 
 As we discussed... The other memo will follow shortly from Maureen McVicker (my assistant). 
 How are we handling these now?  Last time I talked to Jeff, we weren't going to lift the restrictions until next week (assuming we do lift the restrictions).  Any word? 
 The other memo will follow shortly from Maureen. 
 I'm not sure yet.  I think we are going to be sending two memos  -- one that I am working on and on that Andy is working on.  It looks to me like the message below fits better into Andy's memo.  I don't think they will be combined into one, but I'll know more tomorrow. 
 Houston has experienced catastrophic flooding. My flight has been cancelled. It is conceivable that I could get out tomorrow, but I am wondering if I should try.  I could still make the speech if we don't get more rain, but given the lack of other reasons for me to go, I am considering cancelling.

 I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your questions:  both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to Rick Shapiro.  From a government affairs standpoint, I've divided the world between Rick's group (the Americas) and Mark Schroeder's group (Europe and Asia).  Both Rick and Mark report to me.  Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team, working for the head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder).  Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on various executives to help from time-to-time). 
 Could you work with Allison to get the needed information to cathy. 
 Looks good.  Some of his questions suggest he's going to include a fair amount of industry reaction -- which could be a mixed bag, some are clearly threatened by efficiencies in bw markets.  Looks like it will be a really good story.  He definitely appears to be excited by it. 
 A bit lengthy, but I think it looks fine. 
 This is the e-mail I was talking about. 
 I do support the change.  Let me know what I can do to help.  You are correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions, particularly the US.  What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is:  gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.  Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation).  Again, I don't recall this ever being an issue.  It seems to work:  outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues. 
 Please send the economist piece around. 
 No, I had the right date from our previous communications. 
 When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control "path 15"?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and are there links between these "preferences" and the current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.

 what does the siting bill provide for? 
 Skilling will be speaking at the National Press Club next week.  He'll give an overview of Enron's business, talk about what's going on in power markets, and what should be done to fix the current problems.  California will get covered as well.  Other than what we have already discussed, is there anything Jeff should know or address in his remarks? 
 yes  --  just make sure the working group leaders know. 
 Look at this.  Baum finally speaks up  -- way too late. Can somebody tell me what SDG&E's energy rate was pre-dereg? 
 They refer to expedited siting.  What are the provisions? 
 fyi 
 Yes, thanks.  Lay is going to be giving the keynote.  It may be a hard story to assemble: the gas market is deregulated and structured pretty much the way we would like to see it done in both gas and power markets, yet we still have high prices.  It's a bit of a stretch to blame it all on OPEC.  I'm interested in any views you may have. 
 Got your message.  I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC.  I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.  He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine. 
 Thaniks for the note.  Christie is now organizing our university relationships, so direct the communication to her.  Thanks again

 The PAC did not give the money.  PAC contributions to federal candidates are limited.  The money was a combination of individual contributions Ken solicited and soft money donations to the Republican Party. 
 attached is a copy of my california testimony.  The proceeding was somewhat productive, but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points.  Our view on this is:  the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants suppliers are begging to build, let the utilities hedge outside the exchange, and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed).  What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now:  Congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of session now.  Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to act.  Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime. 
 Attached is my testimony.

 I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.  Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.  Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal article identifying Linda among the "Washington 100".  We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those was Secretary Summers who said:  "Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met." "Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen."  On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to Linda.

 I understand from Shelley that you are going to be seeing Commissioner Breathitt on Monday.  We have been working to persuade her to vote for forceful FERC action on electricity issues.  She is widely viewed as the swing vote (with Massey and Hoecker being the other two votes) needed for the Commission to take action.  Attached are two documents -- one is a set of talking points for you and the second is a FERC action plan that we are floating with several of the Commissioners. 
 fyi  - there has been some concern that this deal was being put together without Connecticut authorities knowing the full extent of our interest in FCEL.

 I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point.  For example, how much of the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes?  He wants to make the point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.

 Joe - there is no announcement today.  I tried to leave you a voicemail but apparently the system is down there.  Before we can offer an outside person a VP position, the Executive Committee must sign off.  We are going to be going through that process in a few minutes.  Then we begin the offer extension and negotiations.  The person we are recommending is Linda Robertson, one of the two people I mentioned to you before.  Please guard the information carefully.  Last time we talked, when the list had been narrowed to two, DeLay's office called with the exact two names and started pushing us to hire a Republican.  As you know we interviewed candidates of both political affiliations and just settled on the best person.  Ken told DeLay's office that's how we do things and Ken is comfortable (actually enthused) about the choice.  When some external announcement is done, you will be involved and your considerable contributions will be prominently mentioned.

 Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it more explicit:  The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity infrastructure more than anything else.

 More indications that the power angle may be fruitful 
 The senator's speech is focused on the oil sector almost exclusively, but it does an exceptional job of framing the importance of the issue. 
 Eliz -- I need your group to put together a search which captures the comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover their shortfall.  In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their "rate reduction bonds" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.

 I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.    "Hunt, Hunter L" <HLHunt@georgewbush.com> 09/27/2000 11:25 AM

 I would like to do this, but I have a speaking engagement the next day -- do the time zones work out so that I can do both or do I need to find a sub for the nov 1 speech? 
 Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and pricing problems in the California market.  In summary, the proposal would have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids for 5-10 year packages of power from suppliers.  The gov asked if anyone had successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already.  I need your help to identify and describe any such examples (European or North American) by mid day Monday. Jeff and I will have a follow up call with the governor on Monday.  Thanks

 When we talked about me speaking at the conference in Nov. Enron's management conference had not yet been scheduled.  Now it has and, of course, it conflicts... it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at Enron.  I will take care of finding a substitute, but wanted your thoughts on a couple of candidates:  how about Seabron Adamson, Richard Tabors or Scott Magrane(sp?).  The latter is at Goldman Sachs and, last time I talked to him, was working on Transcos.  Let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at FEBA so I can take care of the problem. Thanks 
 Am I taking care of you or what?? 
 I mentioned the need to call Gramm in the exec committee meeting today and Ken is willing to do it.  The talking points ISDA sent looked fairly generic.  Given Ken's relationship, and the fact that he has talked to Gramm previously on the subject, what should we ask Ken to cover?  I'd like to give him a background document and talking points like we did last time.  I will send it by fax to you Chris and would appreciate it if you could update it as appropriate. 
 Do you still expect Guinn to call Ken?  If so, do we have updated talking points (and background) for Ken? 
 I want to keep my subscription current.

 Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose.  The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway.  By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.  I know the Southern cone team is moving to make it right, but I see absolutely no reason to come don on anyone about this.

 If you can cover it I would say yes.  It's a key race and we have been close to Ashcroft for years.  Let's make sure he knows we gave it.... we need to follow up with him.

 One of the things you should include in your report to Koenig and Frevert is our preliminary views on the RTO filings.  Perhaps it's simply that we are not going to be satisfied until FERC forces nondiscriminatory access and we will object to every filing and fight every shortcoming.

 Rosie and Sherrie:  Jeff Ken and Joe wanted to discuss the attached.  Joe -- this is the same document I forwarded to you earlier. 
 The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday. 
 My mistake, but no reason to stop the presses. 
 thanks.  the letter is already out, but we will be accurate in follow up calls and in press interviews.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/31/2000 08:33 AM 
 Any interest? 
 Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives. 
 I am out of town. Joe - can you attend?    Laura Evans@EES 10/31/2000 02:27 PM 
 Please ask Ken to sign the following.  But, in the Advisory Council letter delete the reference to the December Board meeting and check with Ken on whether he still plans to brief the Enron Board at the December meeting (I believe he talked to Kelly Kimberly about this). 
 I think it looks good.  a few suggestions though:  I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the road).  We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.  I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is consistent with what we have said all along.  We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize utilities for underscheduling" not predicting.  Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy outside the spot should help do.  (Also, my title is just EVP and Chief of Staff)    JMandelker@aol.com 11/01/2000 03:32 PM 
 Did Ken ask us to sponsor it or just consider it?  I'm wondering what if anything we gain from such an investment, but I have an open mind on it.    Joe Hillings 10/30/2000 08:35 AM 
 I'm normally not a big fan of conferences, but this one may be of interest. I think it may be of even more interest if we don't speak: it's possible some utilities may say some of the same things we would say, but they may be less likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond.  Let me know what you think. 
 My only comment relates to the Azurix reference  ... it's not a significant part of the biz and things have changed recently.  i don't think it merits reference.    Rick Buy@ECT 10/23/2000 02:59 PM

 I don't want to disrupt building a more collegial relationship here, but I have some concerns about their reticence to sound more positive about reaching agreement on our two key issues.

If the barriers for EEI are insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members, can they facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group?

 I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday. The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.  Please help with the following information: Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever information you have. Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue. Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already approved. Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation. ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of the PX report too. CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less than 10%)? Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)? Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility (and the regulators) out of the merchant function. Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need these guys on board. Thanks.

 I think this is a fine attempt, but I continue to believe that a pure relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the process works in practice.  A separate list of desired behaviors, criteria etc can be used to guide discussion but I believe the ranking itself should remain purely relative. 
 I share your perceptions of Jose, though I don't have as much contact as you do.  I know also from some recent discussions with Rick (who has also had a fair amount of contact with Jose) that he has very positive views on Jose's work.  I think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have a good discussion about Jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked.    James M Bannantine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 07:13 PM 
 I realize the group may go a different way with this, but I remain convinced that we should go to a pure number system (ie a pure relative ranking) and use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the differences between people.  Just adding the qualifier "relative to peers" glosses over what's really going on.  The behavior and skill descriptors tell everyone what is valued here and guide the discussion.  The relative ranking lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or "looser" on performance rankings, terminations, and comp.    Gina Corteselli 10/16/2000 01:31 PM

 I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.  I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.  I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure number system.  We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.  You don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations.  I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly.  I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior).  I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously.  I'm not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot.  I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping of bounds ... quite the contrary.

 I understood the "validation" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches.  What we specifically discussed, and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates.  We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.  I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.  In the ENA context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point). Let's just get this done.

 Wendy Gramm (an Enron Board member) referred Jay Valesquez(sp?) to Jeff Skilling about an event in Dallas for  Senator Lugar.  The event is Sunday November 19 and Jeff is out of town.  Would you please give Jay a call and decide what we should do? Jay's number is 202-973-5980 
 Sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail while she is out.  Further,  I was only copying her on messages that many others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).  But, if this is a standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in California, I think it leaves a bad impression.  Can we find a way to direct urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external lobby team? 
 Per my voicemail, attached is a proposed "statement" to open the Executive Committee meeting on Monday. 
 Let's process this request.  I think it's justified. 
 Eliz -- does this allocation reflect the cuts we have already made? 
 Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker.  I just wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).  Thanks for the comment on the hearing.  In some respects I don't think the first panel could have gone much better;  everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for different reasons).  The other staff reports are also looking good.  Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is.    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 11/10/2000 12:33 PM

 There are a few other issues we need to look into:  Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO -- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this "exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative? Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments. Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward. We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible). Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

 What does this proposal imply about transmission pricing.  We have debated from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure "loads pay" transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity). Where do we stand?    Charles Yeung@ECT 11/09/2000 11:19 AM 
 I need you to run these items by Rick.  I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to certain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid, let's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of things we need to consider. 
 congratulations!  One thing to add to the arguments:  we have to make the adverse effect on consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.  We need the legal arguments too, but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven discussion.  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have to allow a true market price to be posted.  California has seen the cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.  That's not good for consumers.  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to "outsource" the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.  Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our written and oral presentations.  Do you agree?    Robert Hemstock@ECT 11/15/2000 06:28 PM 
 Thanks for the message.  I agree that once we have a good outline of what we are going to do we are going to need someone who can get it done.  I think you would be an outstanding candidate for that role (seems to me we went after you once before).  Is your inquiry confidential or can I discuss it with others?

 If we are interested in doing this, the interviewee should probably be from EEL 
 Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said -- ie the soft cap only applies to PX and ISO bids and not to any bilateral contracts including bilateral fwd contracts?

 As I mentioned at the executive committee meeting, we have a number of people who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.  We believe that a call from you to Cheney may be required.  David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team. Woody Wodraska.  Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and Florida.  He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.  Amanda is aware of his interest and is amenable to his service. James Steffes.  You know Jim.  He is one of the most creative and talented people in my organization.  He is familiar with state and federal energy regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting team for commission nominees.  I have talked to Jim and he is interested. Others.  We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market regulation.  The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they would like to have.  Among them:  Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a republican who works for us in the upper midwest.   Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the "vetting" team as possible.  Let me know how I need to proceed. 
 can you find the contact and see if they are still interested in the money? 
 That flight time is fine.  A couple of other things:  I need to meet with McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday.  Please set up with Suzanne Nimocks' office.  Also, my return should be first thing Tuesday morning (I think we had discussed Monday night originally).  Just get me on the first available flight to Roswell.

 Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the market.    Susan J Mara 11/17/2000 06:09 PM 
 It looks like a good letter.... heavy on explanation of our position. At some point I'd like to hear more of the background that's leading us to this position.    Richard B Sanders@ECT 11/17/2000 10:19 AM 
 You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to $100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why.  I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a "process".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform (with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not exclusively the Chamber's fault).  Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next level, not just protecting its current position.  Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our current dues to $100,000).  Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me. 
 Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.  Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to understand those reasons).  What did the group accomplish?  Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?  Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future? Any changes to the working group process itself?  Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, please provide the feedback by December 1.

 Great work.  Any indication that the publication of the Stanley investigation is having any adverse effect? 
 meeting file 
 I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December Board meeting.  I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors (ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons) if possible. 
 I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the presentation.   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.  Some of the points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in addition to outlining the changes.  Some of the themes which we should develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees on this e-mail).  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.  I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting before we get together with Jeff.  I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
 Attached are my suggestions. 
 Proposed edits attached.  Looks good -- I like the references to the energy savings... I think we should try to get this story some play in california; not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are working with in the Gov's office.  Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the final.  Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.       Peggy Mahoney@EES 11/27/2000 09:39 PM

 I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.  We are already doing a significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's (author of The Prize) new book "The Commanding Heights".  We have looked at numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target audience.  We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time. I'll ask Margaret Allen to handle the decline.

 I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.

 Thanks.  Look at the attached ... it may be too late for this afternoon, but I took a shot at a revised way of presenting the investment fund and the associated issues (substitute for slides 15-17?) 
 I agree with Rick.  I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments. 
 please block off on my calendar 
 key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.  it's easier for me to remember those who are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.  it's also interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by his vision for a new approach to the energy business.

 I'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint, but we can't move forward until we have legal (including FCPA) approval.  I have exchanged voicemails with Elizabeth Labonowski on this and she is on it.  If you have consulted local counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with Elizabeth. Once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal OKs and document later (as we have in other cases).  This issue has come up before in Europe.  The first time through is the hardest and slowest.  After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent requests move faster.  But we have to get it right.  Even in Europe, where our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in Europe -- even where other American companies don't).

 LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or move out.  Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people who ended up leaving the company:  he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind (Dave left).  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the company.  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.  It's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization.  He has been told that he needs to find something now.  Could you guys look into this?  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, or find him something through the redeployment process?

 I made a couple of suggestions on slide 17: a wording change in the first bullet and I dropped ECT from the example list -- I think the EES and EBS examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly.  I think showing the ranges for MDs on slides 14 and 19 is fine.  I didn't see a reference to the possibility of an EMD level.  I think that's probably OK -- Jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses the ranges in the MD level. 
 Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the results and does the MD ranking.  Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make sure he has these too.  Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.  Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's PRC.

From time to time, I'm sure we will all be called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive. 
 It's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so I need a "call out" number from the charts ... specifically,what happened to microsoft's turnover rate for how much stock decline -- eg did it go up 33% (from 9% to 12%) for "x" decline in the stock price?

 It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.  The color scheme looks good.    Gina Corteselli 12/07/2000 08:03 AM 
 Mo - please set up a call 
 Cindy -- it seems to me we should use an HR distribution to get this out. Let Mike and I know what you think. 
 Dolores:  I'm sorry, but Steve just let me know that he will not be able to attend tomorrow's luncheon.  Hope this doesn't cause too many problems.  Thanks.   Maureen      Dolores Fisher 12/12/2000 10:49 AM 
 Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, so there is no demand response when prices rise.  On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4. Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 12/12/2000 02:40 PM 
 Congratulations! 
 calendar and respond 
 Yes, you are. 
 Thanks for the message. 
 That's OK, I was going to use it in the presentation, but it wasn't essential.  Was my talk what you were looking for? 
 I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues.  I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be  a serious mistake.  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation.  I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora.  I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route.  I look forward to the discussion.    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/17/2000 02:20 PM 
 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as primary contacts for the operating companies:  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere  EES: Harry Kingerski  ENA: Jim Steffes  In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report to Steve Kean in that capacity.  There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a "go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies. 
 Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! 
 Any follow up questions or India press about the bloomeberg story I sent you yesterday? 
 fyi 
 Joe asked me to get in touch with you regarding Indian media reports/inquiries on possible sale or sell down of Dabhol and to discuss a possible statement in the event we get additional inquiries.  Give me a call - 713-853-1586, home: 713-621-6550; pager: 888-906-9761. 
 I agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list.  This gives them a great opportunity to look smart -- "we went to the market and got price protection".  On the messages we need to include Mark's top three:  1) price caps cause shortages (Rob Bradley: let's put some historical examples together) 
 I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection.  The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems.  On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering). 
 I do not.    Enron Energy Services

 Preliminary congratulations!.    Looks like a good plan.  Keep me posted. 
 I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition.  We will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition.  the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement, not after the group gets underway.  Can we get in touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/18/2000 05:03 PM 
 Wow!  Was this expected? 
 Anybody at the CFTC or on the hill we want to send brochures to? 
 Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records?  It seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts.   Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.  What do you think? 
 I still need to talk to you about our public message in India.  I am on my way to Calgary tonight.  My hotel number is 403-266-7331.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the referral.  We definitely want to get our story out to these guys.  Just for future reference, Meredith Phillipp is handling "New Media" for us.  Thanks 
 Strong work, Laura! 
 Will we capture these "accelerations" in our accomplishments? 
 Baby, I'm going to San Francisco on Aug 14?(Sunday) returning Wednesday. Wanna go?? 
 Attached are my comments on the Bliley amendment to the Largent amendment. 
 Let's add this to our daily distribution. 
 We don't know yet.  He has been invited and we expect most will show up, but we won't know until they do.    Enron Energy Services 
 In the underscored language added to the RTO section I would insert "access to" between the words "planning" and "maintenance".    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/20/2000 06:22 AM 
 I have you down as a "yes" to attend the meeting.  Maureen McVicker (Steve's assistant) 
 Let's take the opportunity.    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/19/2000 06:32 PM 
 I do too, but I think you should send it with the appropriate caveats (which I communicated verbally to her). 
 Fine 
 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - -  Seeking Advice of Counsel - -  Attached is a draft public statement for your review and comment.  The groundrules for using these statements are as follows:  All press inquiries should be directed to Eric Thode.  We will use the more "basic statement" unless press inquiries are specific and informed by knowledgeable industry participants.  We will use only those parts of the more detailed statement which are necessary.  The document begins with a background piece to briefly educate Enron personnel who may not be aware of Project Stanley but may be called upon to respond to regulators' or customers' inquiries.  Aleck - - please get Seabrou's help filling in the blanks.  Richard - - feel free to forward to outside counsel as you see fit. 
 Richard:  Please do not forward the Project Stanley email that we sent to you earlier today.  I am making some revisions and will forward the revised document out to you and the others.  Thanks. 
 Looks good. 
 looks good 
 I think you have picked the two most interesting industries.  Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to). That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful.    Rob Wilson@ENRON 07/24/2000 04:44 PM 
 My message was sent before I finished it. I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay --  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but also some substantial and interesting differences. Good luck with your studies. My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.    Rob Wilson@ENRON 07/24/2000 04:44 PM 
 Thanks for the update.  Congratulations on your progress.
