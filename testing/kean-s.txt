 Sorry, I had saved your list for the Europe AA PRC and didn't include them in my draft of the memo.  I am sending another version shortly that has that information included. I don't think I need anything more from you, unless you have other comments  on the memo.  Thanks

 Thanks for the note. Jim Hughes asked the same question you did.  Here is my (and John's) response. 
 Here are the message points 
 This is an issue we need to stay on top of.  Felicia: could you please put= =20 some background together for everyone on the list? 
 Make sure this is consistent with the lists we put in the memo.  thanks 
 Excerpts by email are fine.  Also, as I mentioned, I am very impressed with your background and accomplishments, but I would like to have you meet a couple of other people in my group before making a final offer. Thanks and stay warm!    "Kim, Amy" <AKim@m-g.com> 03/09/2001 08:44 AM

 Got a voicemail from Rob Walls.  They are (have been) looking into it. 
 No, contact Rosalee Fleming (ken's assistant).  I let her know that you would be preparing the briefing.

 It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest.  I have talked with John several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business.  As a result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the proposed budget for "01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort).  Having said that, my view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer issues associated with the asset sales.  Do you agree? 
 Please see attached.  Rob, perhaps while in London you could stop by Mark's desk to discuss. 
 How important is this fight to us now (see attached article on ExIm)? 
 I think this is a very interesting idea.  Please get with Bill D. and make sure he gets a description of what we would need to do to physically accomodate the station and make sure he's comfortable with it before we go ahead.    Laura Schwartz 03/05/2001 12:52 PM 
 Please see the attached letter to Feinstein. 
 Just received a voicemail from Stan.  He knows Mike; he does not have any spots for him right now.  My suspicion is that the EES discussions are not ultimately going to yield fruit.  We are probably going to have to discuss what's next. 
 Thanks for the update.  The Western Governors remain the best avenue we have for preventing price caps and California's attempts to secede from the grid. We need to keep pushing information to them regarding these issues.  Attached is some text I have been using for correspondence with policy makers regarding California issues.  Feel free to use it.       Susan M Landwehr 03/02/2001 05:09 PM 
 I'm not saying we should buy this service, but I do think we need some way = of=20 staying on top of TV spots mentioning Enron. 
 Ask Karen for the distribution list she would like to send these to for today's 1:30 meeting.  Also please reserve 47c1 for the meeting so I can use the computer screen. 
 I am interested, but it's probably more important that Jeff Dasovich and Sandi Mccubbin (in our SF office) know, so that they can keep the politicos informed (and keep them from doing something stupid).  Thanks    Enron Energy Services

 I think I can recommend that the time be set aside, but it would be helpful if we pointed out to Emerson that it must be clear that there is a clear opportunity for Enron before we schedule the meeting.  Maybe you could use this to get some progress on a bundled outsource deal.    Nate Ellis@EES 02/28/2001 03:05 PM

 Having worked on the Enron Advisory council process, I have one observation: consider having some or all of these individuals as "guest speakers" rather than formal memebers.  You can still have them review information, do their homework, and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics. Also, you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the Future.  He sits on the Enron Advisory Council and knows the company well.    Kelly Kimberly@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS Sent by: Stacy Walker@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 03/01/2001 02:27 PM

 The United Way kickoff is here!  The "Millionaire Game for Millions" will be played after the Employee Meeting this Wed. at the Hyatt.  A FREE lunch will be provided in the park after the game.  It will be a casual day and wear green to support the CORP. game show participants.  I encourage you to click on the United Way web site to make a contribution. Everyone that makes a contribution by COB Friday will be eligible for the Governmental Affairs raffle for BIG PRIZES!!  While I encourage you to give generously, any amount is certainly helpful.  A weekly contribution of:  $1 provides 8 families with a week's work of food $2 helps teach 5 adults to read, breaking the cycle of illiteracy $5 provides 60 seniors with a nutritious meal and social interaction at a senior center  For example, last year UW in the Houston Gulf Coast area fed more than 1,000,000 seniors; helped 42,000 children attend quality childcare; and provided job training to 45,000 people.  Through United Way's volunteer allocation committees, projects are funded and reviewed to ensure accountability.  It is an effective way to give back to our community.  Thanks for your support. 
 As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this summer.  There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of re-regulation.  At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:  How great of a threat is re-regulation. How might we respond. How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?

 I would like to exchange ideas on topics for the upcoming Enron Advisory Council meeting.  The discussion you led last time was particularly thought provoking and I'd like to extend an open-ended invitation for you to take the floor again on a topic of your choice.  We will have presentations from Gavyn Davies and Larry Lindsay on macroeconomic trends as well as the customary domestic political update from Bill Kristol.  The balance of the meeting will focus on markets which are, or could be, commoditized.  We will update the Council on new markets we've added to the Enron portfolio through Enron Networks, (most recently metals and paper).  A presentation by you on this, or another trend, would be most welcome.  Let me know what you think.

 This is an interesting idea. 
 Shelley and Jim, who should follow up? 
 I agree with John's recommendations. We have been doing surprisingly well in the press.  And, for the most part, those who write bad stuff are doing so based on ideology ... we are not going to convert them. 
 Tony Pryor (GPG legal) asked if we have any credentials/tickets left for die hard democrats in the company.  I know Tony will understand if they are already spoken for, but if we have some left that would go unused, we have a volunteer.  How's it going?  Are you partied out yet? 
 fyi 
 Tom:  What address should I use for the Sen. Wyden letter?  Thanks. 
 Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer, Joshua Sheinkman.  As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more details.  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of financial information. The additional details they are looking for include: what information should be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made available and who should make it available.  On this last point, I suggested that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned utility, an ISO or an RTO).  I also pointed out that FERC could make this happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.  Extending FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the legislation. Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and forward to Linda. Linda, after we have the information (and perhaps some legislative language to go with it) please forward to Joshua at joshua_sheinkman@wyden.senate.gov. Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the legislation.  (Linda) It may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to FERC asking them to use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible for those entities wver which they have jurisdiction. (Linda and Joe) 
 Absolutely.  Feel free to use the content.  I forgot to give you Mike Day's number; it is: 415.765.8408.  As you'll recall, you asked for a California energy expert.  Mike certainly qualifies.    Laura Ipsen <lipsen@cisco.com> 02/13/2001 07:04 PM

 The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob.  We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially commodities or "commoditzable" goods).   Most recently we have extended into metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of agricultural commodities.  I'd like your help in identifying a guest participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or both) of two perspectives:  business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.  (I have asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well).  public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react?

 We move alot of people around Enron.  In fact, on an annual basis, we make about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).  We have found at Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased productivity and communication.  Given our tight office situation in Houston, moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused some disruption.  We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve later this year when we begin occupying the new building.    Erin Rice 02/13/2001 11:09 AM 
 I am attaching several items that I hope you will find useful when you brief Chambers:   A background document (which is a bit dated, but still useful). This is an internal document, so I would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential (though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents). A basic outline of solutions. A summary of the Governor's recent executive orders. (It's another internal analysis.) I think these orders show a better understanding of the problems and solutions than we have seen before.  As we discussed on the phone, our biggest problem is inertia ... we don't have much time, many solutions have long lead times, and the political wheels grind slowly.  Jeff Dasovich: please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal and anything else that you think might be helpful background for Laura. 
 Leslie:  I checked with Steve and he would like you to revise it.  Thanks,  Maureen    Leslie Lawner 02/12/2001 11:36 AM

 Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a couple of months ago.    John Ambler@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/09/2001 05:35 PM 
 I am hoping we can prevail upon you two for your customary, if not always cheery, review of macroeconomic trends.  Please let me know. 
 fyi 
 Great presentation, as always.  I think you should add a brief set of talking points:  what are the key messages we want to convey? what, if anything, can we ask Martens to do that would allow some progress in the short run?  Maureen: please get this to Ricardo (he's at the EBS offsite this am). 
 I just read the E-Speak transcript.  I think you did a great job!  I look forward to sitting down with you after we have gathered all the feedback from the website and other sources.

 fyi -- messages re California 
 There may be some press today about Enron's involvement in the Nepal hydro project.  The government of Nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it, but we are not going to.  Kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are not pursuing the project.  Kelly will also be getting in touch with David Howe. I just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting questions. 
 fyi  Also, you should contact Ken's assistant, Rosalee Fleming, to see when would be a good time to give ken a briefing and see what else he needs.  I have told Rosalee that you are preparing the materials for Ken. 
 Here are the documents. 
 what do you think? 
 meeting file 
 FYI -- Kalen is the head of HR for EES;  she works for Beth Tilney. 
 We need to put a briefing book together for Ken ASAP for his California trip. 
 Thanks to everyone for their work on the Senate hearing.  There are a couple of follow-up items:  Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that could be sent to the FERC. Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is necessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get them to Linda? Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to "price gouge" -- yes, that's what she said.  She appealed to everyone's community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while California struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response from Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc. 
 I spoke with Ken about the Business Council.  He agreed: errors of commission are much better than errors of omission.  H e does want to be personally involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls next week to help get some confirmations.  Deal directly with him . . . there's no need for me to be in the middle.  Also, a bit of background: Greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before, but they don't want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press present.  Thanks again for all your work on the Senate hearing.  I felt overprepared -- which is just how I want to feel -- and every bit of information I needed was at my fingertips.

 Summary of yesterdays meeting attached        Susan J Mara 01/14/2001 01:16 AM 
 Attached is a summary of the Jan 13 Davis-Summers summit on the California power situation.  We will be discussing this at the 2:00 call today. 
 I am contacting you on the recommendation of Pug Winokur, who is on our Board of Directors.    Enron has formed an Advisory Council which consists of academicians, public policy thinkers and media, together with Enron executives.  I would like to invite you to address the group on E-Commerce issues at our next meeting  (Friday, September 8th in Houston).  Attached is a list of our Advisory Council members.     I think you will find this group interesting and thought provoking.  Please contact me at your earliest convenience at 713-853-1586. 
 Accurate and sobering.  I've made two small comments just as an fyi.      <Suzanne_Nimocks@mckinsey.com> 01/12/2001 09:18 AM 
 recommendations 
 Joe:  Thanks again for coming to Houston this week.  CNN has a compelling brand and we believe that a number of the components of your proposal are worth exploring further.  However, we are not interested in pursuing discussions of the exclusive sponsorship.  I want to stress, though, that many of the elements of the package you and David presented are of interest and we would like to continue discussions with you.  Please get in touch with us to discuss how we proceed from here.  Thanks again. 
 Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:  Urged us to "stay at the table".  Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices).  QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity).  Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh.  If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply).  Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening.  Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?).  Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.  Thinks it's nearly a "done deal" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.  Says securitization may be harder to get.  Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.  Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow. 
 I tinkered a bit more with the background doc. 
 Nathan, give me  call if you can -- 713-853-1586.  I'm EVP and Chief of Staff for Enron.  We met during the on-campus interview process.  I know we have extended an offer and I'm still hoping you'll accept.  Call me.

 Call me about this 
 Attached is the presentation and speech notes that Ken Lay used on Wednesday at the Austin meeting with Bush, etc. 
 I spent a little over 30 minutes with Robert.  He is a very sharp guy and has a great deal of relevant government experience.  While I don't have a position that would be suitable for his experience level (all of my senior positions are filled), he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an open position.  My impression from Robert is that, while he has some interest in Public Affairs, his main interest is in a commercial position.  I stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could build to it over time.  His main concern was that he not get "lost in the system" if he came in at a level below business unit head.  I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time.

 These were the next to last drafts (before correcting any typos). 
 If you haven't already done so, please give the performance review feedback to your people (with the exception of Vice Presidents) as soon as possible.  The only remaining PRC meeting is for Vice Presidents and Managing Directors.

 OK to update    Sherri Sera 12/29/2000 09:51 AM 
 Scott sent this to Marty, but I assume you already have had communications with him about this. 
 Please respond and copy me. 
 Oops. My computer sent the message before I was finished.  I continue to hope that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management. I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona). I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.  Hang in there. 
 Michelle - I think Linda would fill the spot you and I talked about very well.  Linda is the new head of our DC office; she was asst secy of treasury under Bentsen, Rubin and Summers.  She is very well respected in washington.  She received the Alexander Hamilton award fro Secy Summers -- the highest award presented by the US Treas dept.  She has gotten up to speed very quickly on our issues and I think would serve the progam well (and she's already paid for!!). 
 Forgot to include you on this. 
 We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today. 
 fyi 
 Rosie -- I'm not sure if this went through ... I couldn't find it in my "sent file".  Karen -- attached are the documents I mentioned to you a minute ago. 
 This is very good work.  You make all the points we need to make without spraining anything in the process.  You have been doing a superb job under very difficult circumstances.  On another note:  I don't know if you received my page, but the meeting with Davis was cancelled so I flew back to Houston.  We are trying to get another time, perhaps as early as this week.  Davis did meet with Greenspan and Summers, both of whom we had briefed extensively. 
 The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.  Apparently, he was trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we were bumped.  We are trying to set a new time.  I will share with the Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you helped put together.  Thanks 
 The plan was to hit the issue twice -- once in the short format of Ebiz and at greater length in the longer format of the October issue of Enron Business.  Please let Paul know. 
 Please see the revised memo, which is the final version. 
 As we discussed 
 Steve asked that I forward this revised version to you.   I have incorporated Michelle Cash's changes. 
 I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of those efforts?  Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in California perhaps we should consider it.

 Background information.  I'd like to talk to Ken about making the call. . . I'll see him at Exec comm today. 
 We'll have the usual macroeconomic update from Larry Lindsay and Gavyn Davies, the domestic political update from Bill Kristol and some presentations from Gary Hamel and others focussing on Enron NetWorks. 
 See attached WSJ article, particularly the last paragraph.  The message is: there has not been enough deregulation;  the government is still very much in the way.  California is a perfect example:  the market has responded to demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage. 
 As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use.  Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.  In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market r
